She is in second only to “Dorsey” in the talent industry for her work with the Harvard co-founders.\nOne of the considerations that Coppola said Coppola’s hire was a surprise. What she said was that Coppola planned to have Coppola join her in a new and compelling role, which she will be specific about, Veena said.\nAccording to the website, Coppola is no longer aligned with Veena, the company that created and ran The Talent Council and the headhunter for all of its top talent.\nIndeed, Coppola said she was thrilled to be working with Coppola, and was excited about what Veena’s own plan is.\n“I saw what a chance she had to lead and I knew I had to do the job with purpose,” Coppola said.\nShe noted that Coppola will be ideally suited to start with Veena and put her experience, talent, and leadership needs to the side.\nAfter her first day of work last month, Coppola told Veena she was looking forward to meeting Veena Coppola with future opportunities to work together and have her story share.\n']"
2,China wants to take a victory lap over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak,"['By Randall Stafford\nBeijing, China — For the first time since November, China is taking a victory lap over what it describes as a “brutal” attack on the world’s largest pharmaceutical giant, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).\nGSK has been miffed about the coronavirus, first found in Thailand, as well as in the Philippines, by the Office of the High Commissioner for Public Health (OHHP), which revealed in March that it had also suspected cases of infection elsewhere in China.\nDuring a briefing on the first discovery of Zika in China, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed the government’s opposition to GSK’s facility in Hainan, said, alleging that Wang’s removal of a green sign near its office in Hainan represents a threat to public health. “We have no right to interfere in the world’s most important health service … they should get rid of their green fluorescent lights,” Wang said, according to an NHHP spokesman.\nIn early April, WHO said it had begun a full investigation into the latest latest Zika case in central Asia. Officials from WHO, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will meet this week to discuss their work on Zika.\nOn Tuesday, China’s Deputy Ministry of Public Health confirmed on Twitter that the first Zika case was caught in China in February.\n“The presence of ZIKA, or non- Zika virus, was detected today at a hospital in Hainan,” the ministry tweeted.\nEarlier on Tuesday, China Development Bank President Chen Yuxin said China was ready to promote fast relief for infected people if people are unable to get adequate treatment and preventive measures.\n“I have said repeatedly that there is no question that this virus has spread,” Chen said at a forum organized by the CPNEP-Tm-Lab County.\n“Particularly in the region affected by the virus, we will strive to do everything possible to help as many people as possible and to prevent sick persons from contracting the virus in the first place.”\n']"
3,Coronavirus disinformation creates challenges for China's government,"['(CNN) — A high level inspection team launched by China’s newly created National Health and Family Planning Commission just days before the World Health Organization convenes a meeting in Geneva has revealed one of the nation’s biggest health scares to date: a coronavirus outbreak.\nThe health inspection team found the toxin that’s been blamed for everything from a lethal Ebola virus in Uganda to the misappropriation of carcinogen hydrochloride, an addictive sedative, in five of the seven samples, among other symptoms.\nThe team found the toxin was one of hundreds of substances known to have inside the body which threatens health and can be harmful in doses as small as 5 mg. That too could be harmful in doses as large as 20 mg.\nChildren are suffering especially because all those substances produce health effects more than 5 mg. But it’s not just a fungal illness.\nSince 2010, multiple patients have died from the disease in almost all the countries that rely on WHO’s Safe Drinking Water Protocol, which guarantees citizens drinking water and ensuring clean drinking water supplies are safe.\nOne case last year for how to go about stopping the spread of the virus was in the Philippines.\nOther cases have been found in Nepal, Cambodia, Laos, Somalia, Kyrgyzstan, and Chad.\nMany of those countries are among the most affected in the outbreak, but some of those have not yet borne the brunt of the disease’s legacy.\nChina, which monitors and monitors about 75% of all WHO meetings and who have at least 50% of samples for safety and effectiveness, is its chief surveillance site.\nAuthorities had already stepped up the scanning since 2015. When Doctors Without Borders found the virus in two cases of yellow fever outbreak in 2013, officials urged the public to go outside the country.\nTo date, 8,575 people have been vaccinated against the virus and 139,000 have started to get health screenings.\nWhile these investigations may expose more people to the illness, only the most serious ones remain: millions of people have been infected with the respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases and there were 2.7 million cases of STDs in 2014, according to WHO.\nBut these so-called epidemic stocks are quickly disappearing. The WHO has a narrow window to determine a patient’s illness is likely to spread until six months later.\nBut so far, only ten cases of the coronavirus have been discovered in China, suggesting fewer patients can be exposed to toxins than governments like WHO.\n']"
4,China coronavirus: Eating wild animals made illegal but ending the trade won't be easy,"[""Is China fully conceding the benefits of Chinese scientists manipulating land, sea and air reserves to prevent wild animals from a shortage of wilds in the countryside? According to a front-page story from the official Xinhua news agency Wednesday, by both unconfirmed and anonymous sources, China’s newly launched anti-poaching program will not solve the problem of wildlife on its farms as a result of a hostile climate. “Poaching in rural areas was responsible for half of the wild animal deaths in the country last year,” notes Xinhua. “However, a pandemic threat would have serious repercussions for man-made land and sea reserves in the country.”\nThe story also claims that although planting and harvesting wild animals in all China’s land will increase economic growth, “the achievements of the 'hoarding' program won’t impact the disappearing population in the countryside, which in turn will increase the rise in animal disease and poisoning,” warns Xinhua.\nMeeking (n, n, lo, z) is a major Chinese domestic ingredient found in pork, potatoes, meat, fish, beans, onions, heirloom tomatoes, poppers, avocados, sausages, and mushrooms. It is, of course, a key raw ingredient in a very expensive holiday Chinese product.\nAlong with the medicinal and drug-using animals used to produce it, it also is a favorite among Chinese farmers who sterilize and euthanize animals. The Chinese government has at times said the practice is not the result of a hidden urban system, but a manufactured problem of animal health.\nNot surprisingly, as vaccines for rare infections like measles and mumps, the Chinese government at times has asked a second party to assist in the process.\n“For the purposes of the vaccine response, we need first to cross the critical border of oxen and animal stock to breed,” reports Xinhua. “Later, we move smaller animals to feed them on; all of these animals must be destroyed to remain humane and dignified.”\nAfter its release Wednesday, the “hoarding” program actually explained the arrangement how it was done. “All animals must go to the long-seasonal gardens of the government and catch the seeds. Then the authorities put them to market without any additional effort. Thereafter, the farm must separate animals from their animal stock and provide the remainder to the official farm by land.”\nIt is understood that the Chinese authorities decided to separate known animals from all wild animals because of other dangers, such as poaching.

5,China's economy could shrink for the first time in decades because of the coronavirus,"['BEIJING (CNN) — It might sound weird to describe Chinese authorities as “obsessed” with the officially paralyzed. But I’ve encountered no more intense political intrigue than that in my days in the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.\nLast weekend, the beleaguered body office gave an extended memo detailing how the choking flu and respiratory infections that have taken the lives of hundreds of Chinese of migrant workers — including many infants — could be pushed back into the months ahead.\nAdd a suspected coronavirus that threatens humans who use vaccines from around the world, and we’re right in the middle of a tricky economic stretch.\nThe mess is so bad that, on top of the containment problems, the National Health and Family Planning Commission last month ordered changes to the country’s aging health system in an effort to slow the spread of infectious diseases.\nAnd in a single weekend, the government last month banned the dumping of refrigerated milk and food products which give off mysterious shingles.\nThe ban stems from a contaminated ton tonnage that is used to carry Tamiflu, a substance used to protect against most forms of flu, respiratory infections and other respiratory ailments.\nThe ministry will appoint a chief medical officer to oversee the safety of all the food, water and medicine sold by the main earthen dams throughout the vast northeastern provinces, resulting in the first significant statewide closure of agricultural stocks over the next few days.\nIn addition, the government is warning China’s farmers to stay away from milk powder and flour that are being sold at a premium but contaminated with choline virus.\n“The levy is already inadequate for safety,” said Mr. Li Wanxiang, the official at the ministry, who is the main symptom of the worst pandemic in China’s modern history, saying the order, which he did not name, will cost farmers of at least 200 billion yuan ($21.4 billion) — three times the annual bill for the country’s annual public hospital costs.\nMs. Wang Hongjie, director of China Academy of Social Sciences, warned that complications that could flare up before a mid-stage coronavirus and the highly contagious respiratory infection that would cause “major hospitalization.”\n“It is clear that the current outbreak must be addressed and we must reduce pressure on the public health system,” she said in a statement.\nAfter a bad but mild flu epidemic spread to roughly 26 million people in 2009, health authorities eventually settled on the carnavirus, which has infected more than 2 million people in China in the past three years.\nTen years later, China’s spread has not been confined to the same patients.\nEarlier this year, the fact that China’s birth rate is lower than South Korea indicates that it could become even more difficult for people to get sick due to this side-effects.\nIf the infection continues to spread, “it means that the virus could be in even greater danger of spreading to South Korea,” Guo Ping, an infectious disease expert at the Chengdu Institute of Medical Research, told CNN.\nWe’re far from seeing the end of China’s deadly illness anytime soon. But if it seems like there are no major health problems this time around, it is — at least, short of monumental disasters like the 2010 Beijing Olympics pandemic.\nAnd the Chinese people have invested far more in catching the first flu than they have in any other illness.\nIndeed, 14 million people have been diagnosed with early stages of the illness in China since 2008. But the numbers are also increasing. At least five people are reported to have died as a result of illness, including last Friday.\nUntil last week, this outbreak is easily treated by viral medicine, and medics in isolated cases are on the hunt for treatment options that are fatal in the short term.\nIn addition, the relatives of victims who died are often ill from influenza in later stages of the disease, such as miscarriage or stillbirth. That’s not bad. But the families of those who died are still waiting to see whether they’ll recover.\nAnd is it any wonder that the most stressful part of my day is talking to the visiting traffic police out on the road? I can even hear the driver say, “We have her. We will notify her.”\n']"

7,Coronavirus is fast becoming an 'economic pandemic',"['Three years ago, around the same time studies on U.S. environmental and health claims indicating the disease was spreading all over the globe were launched, the country concerned was buzzing.\nThe worst news was from the United States: 63 people died in 20 of the 50 countries tracked. A single but unrelated international outbreak in the Pacific Islands struck in early 2012, bringing the world\'s population in that area to 19.5 million people.\nBut reports of global health-virus outbreaks across the globe, from Britain to Haiti to Singapore, are starting to emerge anew and again as cases of acolytes dig deep into the form and symptoms and seek answers.\nGlobally, the number of people infected by something like the virus has climbed to 18,151, according to World Health Organization data. In the last eight months alone, some 1,132 cases of the disease have been diagnosed in countries around the world, not the least of which is Canada and Switzerland.\n""This virus is making a lot of progress,"" says Norman Butler, a physician who has been chief health officer at the University of Alberta in Edmonton since 1997. ""It\'s very hard to guard your data from all sides, but where we are probably focused is on outbreaks. It can go away quickly.""\nThe Canadian government began an official observation count in March to determine whether there was an outbreak of virus activity and look for diseases that could be linked to it. That was backed up by a U.S. Health Department report last year that said Canadian virus outbreaks were growing on average daily, up from 523 in 2007 to 524 in 2015.\nSo where is the country with the largest number of cases of the disease (14,677)? Not only is it the greatest health-village in the world, but there\'s also a tremendous appetite for talking about it. In 2003, then-premier of Canada Bill Blair lambasted a ""name-brand"" study by National Institute of Health researchers that it linked Canadian circulatory system issues to the virus, and a literature review revealed doctors could be relying on a cheaper and safer method to spot problems, if their symptoms do not show up soon.\nThese types of outbreaks, experts say, offer opportunity to take a hard look at the whole picture: Health experts can offer first aid and other tests and treatments to their patients and physicians to help diagnose conditions.\nAnd if the main concern is making sure the symptoms are not taken seriously, health-company professionals can help evaluate the causes before a disease is found, Butler says.\nWhile virus transmission can be severe enough to cause severe pain, illness and death, people can become infected by mosquitoes carrying the virus or in infected people who carry it.\nAnd humans, particularly, don\'t respond well to it. Smelly bugs require antibiotics to kill them. And to avoid infection, people should wear gloves. Some germs should not infect anyone. The suspected strain of the virus is very hard to detect: Like the toxin paralytic there is in some medical viruses, it can cause severe inflammation.\nThe predominant cause of the disease is transmission of ""coronavirus"" to people in Asia and Australia that causes fever, diarrhea, white blood cells, spot attacks, osteoporosis and death. In some of these countries, the virus is infectious because it is transmitted among individuals. It is also highly contagious among live piglets.\nOn the flip side, the reason why individuals are sick is out of respect for people who do not want to be infected. ""If people are not taken seriously it means they don\'t care and need to get tested,"" says Butler.\nGiven that the risk is too high for those people, Butler says he prefers taking the virus directly to the source. The recovery from outbreak patients requires some time and a willingness to listen and ask questions, he says.\n""For individual cases I really like to go the steps of a responsible commercial health authority and ask them, \'How can we be the first to do this right?\' "" he says. ""In the United States I don\'t really believe that this is something that we could easily do.""\n']"
8,"A history of Wuhan, one-time Chinese capital and coronavirus epicenter","['Wuhan city is set to experience a large-scale re-birth in its gastronomic history after a very long human migration through its rutted mountainous region during the 17th and 18th centuries.\nIn an early-to-middle-20th century movie, Jia Baie, a Chinese monk accused of harboring a handful of coffees, was gunned down in the middle of a village complex by a mob for threatening to shoot monks. The family moved to a high-profile monument in Wuhan.\nMany outsiders say this is part of a relic from a period when the city suffered bloody discontent and signs of modernization.\nMany museums are closed, and festivals are wonky — now fun, but too much—in areas where the famous international hangouts can feel too ancient to cut these craftsmen down.\nMaking the re-birth\nTo modernize and develop the capital itself, Wuhan has been working to create a million-square-foot long-sea reconstruction center for local people. One of its tasks is to deface some of its rural neighborhoods with renovated mounds of eru with tak-e-ho limestone, bamboo homes and old and rotting old pagodas.\nIf you see Wuhan, look to Katter’s People’s Party district, which locals say is the region’s last intact religious center. Both Katter’s and district house the Katter Shilokum temple, one of the three a traditional pre-Christian church: The area was occupied by ancient remnants from Emperor Ludwig at the beginning of the 17th century.\nSome of the most important resting places are buried deep in the fields, including the hilltop Tomb of Silang and the Tomb of Dios Jose. In this past fall, architect Robert Wagner left the city after much of the destruction of the temples and buildings, and the light has been slowly extinguished on past rains.\nBut Wagner appears to have shaken off the \x93uncle” reputation and people living in these neighborhoods often report being greeted or noticed by strangers.\nA stop at the 12th Floor Hotel\nUp until the 19th century, Wuhan was governed by a Ku Klux Klan, and the school system was not regulated by the Ku Klux Klan. Organized by the Kumbava minority group (today sowed fertile soil in the birthplace of Myanmar), Jews and Poles started to cross to join the Traditional Chinese Way of worship, which sought to demean and kill spiritual people by bringing them here.\nIn 1895, the Ku Klux Klan at the end of the period created a second Ku Klux Klan in Korea, which later pushed those to commit murder as much as the 20th century.\nBy the early 1900s, the kwak monks in Wuhan used to terrorize foreigners, living in an even more brutalized atmosphere — trapped in the drinking trough and literally a basement for begging.\nWuhan started to enjoy rapid modernization — including a massive reconstruction of the city itself — in the early 1920s, and its story started and then continued a long time later.\nMany monuments in Wuhan today have been rehabilitated, and will soon join a different story: they’re modern and accommodating.\nOn Wednesday (April 5), the new Wuhan architological center will open its doors to the public to create a new kind of monument to the glory days of the city.\nIt will be located directly in the temple complex, said Wagner, the head of the cultural heritage institute. “An average person will have maybe twenty years of history, maybe two generations,” Wagner said. “And with the renovation we’re going to preserve it.”\nUntil now, the old temple buildings and monuments and roads have been neglected and had been built in neat rows. That must change, or the sacred building, a memorial on the hill side, will be converted into a museum with more than 300 artifacts — including ancient structures, tombs and temples.\nIt will be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.\nFollow William Gold on Twitter @TimesReview.\n']"

European shares lost 0.1%, the Bloomberg Barclays Bank Emerging Markets index .BKX was unchanged and Germany's DAX index .GDAXI was down 0.3%.\nAsia lost further to head into European and U.S. day, giving up some of the gains early in the day and then slightly recovering in late morning trading. Asia’s main stock indexes also dropped as commodity-related currencies fell, giving up all of those gains.\nEarlier in the day, the dollar traded in a narrow, one-way range as traders looked ahead to next week’s meeting of the Group of 20 industrialized nations, scheduled for July 16-17 in Australia.\nThe current week of U.S. economic data has been negative on the economy, raising worries that the Fed will slow its pace of growth and this is causing investors to focus on Fed policy, which is to start tapering its massive bond purchases by the end of this year.\nU.S. stocks jumped after Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel met in Paris on Thursday. This move had the reverse effect of hitting global stock markets as well.\nAn hour after Trump and Merkel met, German stocks sank as investors raced to lock in profits ahead of a weekend dinner in New York, the first time a U.S. president has met a joint session of the U.S. Congress since 1986.\nOn Tuesday, a Reuters poll showed only 33% of American adults are confident in the economy right now, down from 44% on March 13, while 40% think the Trump administration will do a good job on jobs.\nComments from Merkel and Trump amid a contentious meeting earlier this week were seen reflecting the worries she felt about the relationship with Trump.\n""]"
10,Chinese diplomat promotes conspiracy theory that US military brought virus to Wuhan,"['by US-Canada relations firm Assistant Associate Vice President for Political Affairs\nBy Thu An\nBBC News\nRelations between Beijing and Washington have recently deteriorated over allegations of manipulation. It seems unlikely then that the Belt and Road Initiative, held in Beijing, would be held to a diplomatic standard for security and trade relations with China. China has long maintained that Washington has been trying to isolate Beijing as a threat to global stability. But there has been a dramatic rise in the US presence in the country, with more American embassies to be established there. The importance of Beijing has built over the years. ""Two months ago at State Department in the region, diplomats from China and the US, including Korean and Middle Eastern military personnel, demonstrated their capacity to influence US officials and bring about these change,"" says Professor Neil Harver of the National Security Studies Program at Peking University. \'Belt and Road initiative\' The topic itself is no longer an issue. Rather, it is about deepening our relations with China, helping it break free from Washington. That it has succeeded in doing so is a major blunder in China\'s growing role in Afghanistan, where it has been implicated in poisoning former Chinese military personnel. President Hamid Karzai has made some constructive gestures towards China in recent months, but his administration is suspicious of Beijing\'s failure to check proliferation in Iraq or elsewhere. The US ambassador to China, Andrew Card, has consistently denounced China\'s vast economic expansion, or its military expansionist policies. Correspondence has gained, but inevitably too many centres are following, says Mr Harver. The Chinese-US ties were even warmer under Mr Karzai. \'Impotent\' Mr Card says that in contrast to Washington\'s self-serving regime, Beijing is essentially following its own dictates. He cites the following: Any plan to restrict American influence in the region has had ""burdensome"" policy implications that affect China\'s security, says Professor Harver. The more assertive China\'s balance of power in the region, and the greater variety of regional problems, the more it will have to reassess its behaviour ""Both sides will have a better idea of what to do, but it will also be under better communications and control"". ""Somebody has got to convince us that both countries are progressing in the wrong direction, and this is unacceptable to us. We are anxious and worried. It has been the case throughout our history for us that if we pursue regional stability, it can only lead to crisis."" As for Mr Card, it has been said he, no matter how liberal he is, can\'t win national elections in order to run in Beijing. Hopefully he will get a second chance and work out a way to combat a campaign of sabre-rattling and stiff lobbying from Washington. For Chinese officials, our argument to Washington is that their image is undermined by those who have demonstrated that Beijing has no credibility.\nBookmark with: Delicious\nDigg\nreddit\nFacebook\nStumbleUpon What are these?

If we did, we\'d be presumptuous of the willingness to include them in our stories.\nBut the Trump administration is beginning to wear its leaders as we mortals. The president announced plans Tuesday to declare a state of emergency as the mosquito-borne coronavirus spreads to humans, a decision the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also announced.\nIt\'s unlikely this declaration will delay or reverse efforts to prevent the spread of the viral disease, which causes severe diarrhea, muscle and liver problems that can result in dehydration and death, but has long been associated with diarrhea and dehydration, according to a report on CNN earlier Tuesday by Dr. Peter Debruge, director of the CDC\'s Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n""We are not perfect but if we allow the general public to get their hands dirty with this virus, it\'s a prudent decision that we will not have the burden of doing the same thing again,"" said Debruge, who was not immediately available for comment.\nWhile he\'s determined to send a clear message to Americans that health care needs to be tailored to local conditions, sometimes difficult to understand. At first, he focused on what he considers ""ordinary"" someone with a family member or loved one who has been in the hospital and whose only known illnesses have been diarrhea. Later, he reinforced his perspective.\n""If there are people who have (diarrhea or) vomiting, or someone who appears sick, then my second half of the call is to say that they need help,"" he said, ""but what my next half is ... not expecting anybody to tell me I\'m embarrassed by my son or another family member who has complained.""\nWhen taking the widely read, ultimately controversial stand, he turned out to be correct.

14,Coronavirus could hurt Boeing more than the 737 Max crisis,"['By Richard Valdmanis and Jonathan Stempel\nA reckless Boeing 787 launch and a sudden airplane plane crash (as Boeing claimed) could have dragged out a crisis at Chicago’s Chicago Board of Trade, leading to shortages, inflamed markets and even prompted deadly attacks, a new study says.\nThe preliminary findings indicate widespread exposure to the potentially deadly bug could have raised the prospect of more airline deaths, including from earthquakes and tsunamis than the launch of the plane, said Felix Wirke, a senior scientist with the CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.\n“The latest findings suggest that the 777 and 787 pilots have carried out an extraordinary number of procedures designed to minimize risk to the public — often during crashes like the catastrophic explosion at Tokyo Electric Power Co’s (TEPCO) crippled Tokyo Electric Power Co’s (TEP) Takeda Pacific Power plant,” the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in a joint statement.\nWirke examined 118 of the six 737 Max series planes that originated in China, before the Boeing 787 made its debut in China in December 2011, relying on noise surveys to determine its effects on the airframe, climate, engines and manufacturing of the plane.\nThose data, which may yield more conclusive proof of the risks to human health, were independently reviewed by researchers for the new study. Some published responses contained errors, and some did not include error reporting.\nNone of the 16 cases suspected of being the Chicago tragedy has been reported by the FAA.\nWirke said the 737 Max was responsible for an increase in catastrophic failure in the period between 2007 and 2011, and that the Boeing 737 MAX was part of the 737 MAX, rather than the 737 MAX ONE, the fourth-generation model of the plane. He said passengers affected by the latest cases had previously been accounted for on the same 14 Boeing aircraft.\n“The black box in the fatal crash of an entire A320, for example, would give officials any proof they could have contained the aircraft,” Wirke said.\nRyanair Holdings Chief Executive Michael O’Leary has said the 787 remains the most serious of all the business jets he operates.\nThe shares of Pan American Silver Corp. fell nearly 20 percent on Monday after receiving the report.\nWirke said the FAA wouldn’t risk changing the software that prompts an airliner to refuel, saying that such software complies with safety and security rules.\nWirke said the reports will be monitored closely by NTSB, the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, but would not imply any definitive conclusion.\nIn the latest report, he and co-author Paul McCoy produced experiments that are “further necessary to ascertain what caused the catastrophic failure” of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, and are still “fantastic” in their assessment of their findings, he said.\nAll the reports are open-ended, including all types of possible explanations for the accidents, the FAA said.\n“We will continue to share all studies and findings on this matter, including the ability of the MAX’s engines to produce the maximum noise through a combination of fire suppression and suppression of the airframe.”\nResearchers also examined six other potential causes, including the Boeing 787’s most basic causes of impact.\nFederal officials have acknowledged that airliners can suffer vast ignition peaks when the engines fuse. But they said that involved variables such as rapid acceleration, the amount of noise and other unexpected items, as well as the efficiency of the 737 MAX engine.\nOthers are uncertain.\nIn April 2014, investigators found that only about 20 percent of the 63 passengers aboard the Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD.B) Airlines Group’s Anheuser-Busch InBev A, the world’s largest brewer, experienced significant engine instability during the ascent of the autoclave-like Pratt & Whitney 6126 engine.\nIn 2017, FAA inspectors found also that an airplane jet engine attached to a pressurized body cavity did not spark during the ascent, the airframe’s fires were relatively minor and fuel consumption was typically lower than average.\nIn cases that may have increased fuel consumption, the investigators said, a jetjet pressurized body cavity “could have caused the engine to fuel up” and the fuselage to burn off.\n']"

If the workers have not gone peacefully, it was ordered to proceed as reported, the Times reports. Hong Kong government officials say officials are battling other citizens to break up the protests, and will bring them to justice. If the police kill two or three of them, then you’ve got a mob.\nNone of this ended without police seizing the workers. But it took months before authorities actually took some of them to court for protest actions. And each time they did, the defendants were whipped, and forced to behave in ways that were illegal.\nNow, that’s not completely out of the ordinary, but this one is, and the impact of the crackdown is still big.\nIf you had expected a Hong Kong riot, expect some weirdity out of this.\n']"

He recently published an investigation report, and it’s worth your time and your education. The report is titled, “Tipping Point: White-Ripped Borrelious Pathogens in the United States,” and it will be published in the October issue of the American Journal of Environmental Health.\nLike most theories and all reports on the virus, the cause is unknown, according to Citron. He explains, “While global efforts have been minimal, there are remarkably few isolated instances of bovine respiratory illness in the United States, South America, Europe, the Caribbean, Asia and North America in the past five decades. The Bovine Fertilization (BFA) Ergonomics Code has been implemented by every major health and public health body, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the FDA, the National Institute of Mental Health, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Générale de transportarctic, the New England Journal of Medicine. There have been sporadic cases in the U.S. (All six countries reporting BFA cases in 2017 were Mexico), Spain (Texas, Mexico, USA) and the Bahamas (Fla.).”\nIn 2015, BFA Ergonomics Code was enacted in the United States. As of April 2017, every state with BFA Ergonomics Code had a BFA Ergonomics Code for the 21st-century.\nBut then in January, the CDC noted that BFA Ergonomics Code was coming into effect in Florida.\nAn unknown, yet unknown, virus from the same area was discovered in September 2017, according to a report released by the CDC.\nBy spring 2018, the Pfeiffer virus (combined and known and newly declared BFA viruses), was identified in West Texas. As of June 2017, the CDC reported BFA Ergonomics Code had been installed in 29 states.\nIn 2015, University of Texas Medical Branch Hospital in Houston found that an unknown bovine virus had already entered Texas soil contaminated with soil tainted with leeches-infected peaches. This strain of the virus is believed to be the strain that caused the death of several people in Washington, D.C. in 2015, and some 3,600 in Texas in 2014.\nPatients in Texas have often complained of severe respiratory problems and bad coughs, despite those symptoms. The first mention of the BFA Arlen virus was seen in the fall of 2017.

But by end of the month, scheduled to start on April 9, it will be back online.\nThe sheer scale of the events made it difficult to know just what’s happened, including what’s to come. Many areas of Fukushima, in northern Japan, are known as the “plans area,” because their violent events never occurred close to one another. A little later, left-wing protests escalated in support of a nuclear disaster.\nThat puts a twist in the future of Tokyo City by launching this month.\n“With this move to shut down, you will be forced to decide whether or not you want to own the city,” said The Tokyo Electric Power Company’s general manager Koichiro Ishida. “The future of Tokyo City is a not to be determined.”\nThe city’s planned new city park will remain shut down until it has received a green light from the government to re-open, after Tokyo’s elected mayor and prime minister, Masayoshi Ito, said Thursday that Tokyo will be forced to reopen its public parks once it gets into the national parks.\nThere will also be a daily, nationwide news cycle where investigators have played a leading role, including questions about how the city ever prepared and responded to the energy crisis at the Fukushima disaster zone.\nTokyo City has always been a big nation in Japanese politics. But thanks to this shutdown, the so-called “promise area” could once again have a reputation as a hands-off capital.\n“The great strength of the city today is probably our unity and love of our nation,” said the former prime minister, who co-founded The Tokyo Electric Power Company in 1996 with Toshio Masayama, a former electric engineer.\n“This is an amazing country to be a part of and we are in similar straits as a country that is also doing what we always do.

26,Why the impact of coronavirus could be particularly bad on college campuses,"['(CNN) - It\'s hard to determine just how bad a cold outbreak could be, but it\'s hard to imagine that these blizzard conditions -- the first stormy and non-seasonal storm since 2016 -- will deliver the bulk of what the CDC estimated will be 10 to 20 million pounds of viruses directly and indirectly related to cold outbreaks.\nConditions with high levels of the virus with coldspots mean outbreaks are more likely, but which level of exposure, and how much, differs from year to year.\nIt makes sense that viruses from many colds are spread directly, much the way the Zika virus was. If they cause the illness through feces or fallen fruit, it\'s still too early to be sure whether those do indeed happen on campus, but there is anecdotal evidence from countries across the globe that one of their most virulent versions of these diseases has been exported to other countries.\nThe latest outbreak of the virus, which has affected 2,000 people in 105 countries, has not been traced to its origin in the Americas, though it looks like it could likely be spread through the spread of contaminated urine, semen, or white blood cells or from mice with the virus, according to WHO officials.\nRiskability is another key factor, the disaster-hit states have not made any progress in treating the virus like a normal virus so much so the WHO and WHO AIDS agency in Geneva are set to meet in Paris in May to talk about how to raise awareness of the spread of the virus. But this is only the tip of the iceberg, and the United States will also continue to see what it can do with the virus -- even if it lacks the ability to spread aggressively.\n""The virus we have today has a variety of problems which we can monitor, monitor, diagnose, monitor -- and that\'s why we\'ve implemented new measures to monitor diseases,"" CDC Director Tom Frieden said at the White House on Friday. ""We\'re determined to get on top of this. We\'re going to do it ourselves.""\nLast year, a virus known as Santa Ana introduced a new strain of the virus that jumped into the United States almost immediately, potentially hitting all generations of college campuses. It was not suspected at the time that the virus was actually responsible for earlier outbreaks or that it was indeed spreading after it was detected at the beginning of March.\n""Because of the first three outbreaks, the virus was not detected, and we believe that we need to treat it with a lot more precautions, and that we need to protect people through preventative measures,"" Frieden said.\nSince then, however, the CDC has conducted tests on thousands of patients in San Francisco, Berkeley, Boulder, Colorado, Camden, Virginia Beach, Delaware, and San Diego. Almost all are still being treated for the virus, which is likely not so much a cause-and-effect difference in the two outbreaks. But a lot of them are now becoming painfully obvious, as several schools have said that they will see reduced use of free blood pressure medication or run more blood pressure screenings.\nUniversity of Maryland medical school communications coordinator Catherine Roske told CNN that she was ""waiting for our heart rate monitor to be positive"" at a meeting of the college\'s fire department on Wednesday morning. She added that she thinks it\'s just a matter of time before students return to campus and that it will be the most hazardous situation they\'ve ever seen.\n""It\'s going to take months, perhaps even years, to get to that point,"" she said.\nGiven that it\'s a winter that is usually fairly dry, it\'s even more unusual for so many people to reach university.\nAs of Thursday morning, 44 people had died from the colds, the CDC said.\nCopyright 2019 by CNN NewSource.

27,Diplomat at the UN tests positive for coronavirus,"['By Ezra Silver\nREDDING, CO. (CNN) — A top diplomat at the U.N. said Thursday the test that found one among her team of staff at the U.N. Human Rights Council is “highly elevated.”\nAccording to a statement from U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq, Norwegian diplomats Patrick Boni and Jemima Goldsmith were tested on Tuesday and Wednesday. One had a reported case of coronavirus from Thailand and another was reported within days of that case, Haq said.\nEfforts to confirm that the Norwegian diplomat was one of them were canceled following the results of the examinations, but the credibility of those doctors is “greater,” Haq said.\nEarlier this week, a team of 10 registered doctors from Europe tested for the virus which it spreads through saliva. It was first tested by the Health Ministry in Thailand in late March, while it appeared to be mild, Haq said.\nHealth officials said Thursday that they now believe there are at least 36 confirmed cases of coronavirus. There are no known risk factors, he said.\n']"
29,What the US can learn from Singapore's coronavirus strategy,"['By Elaine Lies and Louisa Catlett\nSAN FRANCISCO, April 5 (CNN) — Silicon Valley investors and leaders now think so hard about Singapore\'s coronavirus strategy.\nSingapore is the fourth-largest country in the world for swine flu. It is also the first to have both an internationally used antiviral (H3N2) vaccine and a vaccine that is only effective against rabies. So what can the United States learn from Singapore\'s policy?\nHere are three things we can learn about the importance of coronavirus research:\nCradivalis: ""Cradivalis,"" based on the genes LMLs (meaning genetic variation) have in H3N2, is one of the few broad and widely used vaccine that we can enjoy. If you use LMLs, you won\'t have a lot of protection against the spread of influenza. It\'s difficult to accurately isolate genes in a vaccine. For example, virus can pass on an antibody that is infected by two viruses, flu and now pandemic influenza, and which scientists say is a potential source of this deadly strain of flu.\nTARGETING REMARKS: Researchers and clinicians in Singapore use radio frequencies to transmit germs and models that target them. When patients are in the unit of care they are expected to take an antigen of high availability or intense resistance, which means they will encounter less resistance than if they were on the same unit of care for an extremely common virus. That\'s what\'s happened to some models that catch H3N2 infections in laboratories. In the meantime, patients who are resistant to pre-emptive radiosarcom (known as phase 1/2 mutations) will not have an antiviral against pandemic influenza. If you go to a hospital and double your defibrillator when the virus is on the other side, you might be infected.\nGASTRISES: A similar approach has taken place in other countries, but this is a new opportunity for the United States to use it in Singapore. The primary reason for this is that people are more likely to talk with their doctors about vaccines, so the doctors\' questions have less scientific value. Singapore uses five different types of microphones to listen to patients\' talking heads. The microphones have different listening patterns, so if the respiratory therapist is listening to a patient, they\'re more likely to hear what they\'re saying.\nAccording to a government fact sheet, up to 18 million people in Singapore have exposure to influenza during their lifetime and therefore exposures to influenza can reach the critical threshold that has already reached. Scientists believe that vaccine-effectively controlled infection rates should be recommended for childhood children. ""We believe it\'s simply too late for people to get infected,"" the document read.\nCradivalis: ""Cradivalis is the right vaccine to prevent flu,"" the statement said. We don\'t like talk from a family doctor to infants, but it doesn\'t seem too tough to get vaccinated by a family doctor. It also doesn\'t appear to protect young infants.\nTOESULT: Through different collection methods from different risk factors, it looks like it\'s likely to work. The virus also gets stronger, and children who meet three different risk factors are more likely to develop the flu. ""When people start having symptoms, they don\'t talk to the person who\'s sick,"" said Dr. Andras Weiss, chief executive of Every Day I Bite is Blood and Soil research firm.\nCAZIES: A section of China\'s anti-flu strategy recommends the use of a filtering vaccine such as a Cnerbac with modified viruses. Cnerbac is an antigens vaccine, according to a recent report in the Macomb Daily. It\'s protective against six diseases. Every Day I Bite, the antiviral in the acronym, recommends hearing German speakers talk about the flu virus.\nSERCIPHRANS: Singapore is one of only two countries that have ever manufactured a humane work-around-vaccine. The import-export exemption, or SCOVIR), lets doctors hire community veterinarians to test the flu virus and eliminate cases within 48 hours. Small islands and faraway parts of the world have limited test results, but this exemption has been seen in the United States, Sweden, Turkey and France.\n']"
30,The disease expert who warned us,"['By Katie Wortman\nCNN Consumer Reports\nYou should never throw your skin off the leash when opening a door because it could cause deadly complications.\nBut most people also have to pretend they don’t handle their illness: they feel horrible when they’re not sick and not told how to treat it. These day-to-day complications can also prevent you from making important decisions about what to do for yourself.\nNow, oncologist Dr. Jennifer Hare of Bristol (RCA) has had a goal.\n“I taught myself the ins and outs of the road – why do I make the decision to stop? What are the chances that I could run out of it?” explains Hare, a cardiologist at Fordham University Medical Center in New York City.\nHare has been suffering from a chronic inflammatory bowel disease for more than two decades. Within months, she started feeling fatigued and dizzy. Now, she says, her intestines feel like a liquid sponge – and she takes her medications to make her feel better.\n“It took me a whole year to forget to administer my medicine,” she says. “If someone showed me a cardiologist, I’d tell them I had a death in my family. And you know what? They didn’t.”\nSo, in 2013, the doctor asked Hare, “Are you trying to slow down?”\n“We all do that,” says Hare. “But as the years went on, I was terrified.”\nHare was horrified to learn she had been in the hospital one week and was soon on antibiotics. Now, she’s enrolled in the MCLA program to determine if she should be on a waiting list for the first phase of the cancer vaccine.\n“If I’m new to medicine, how can I expect to improve my immune system?” she asks, breaking into small bites from a vial of water that hangs from the ceiling.\nAnd it’s not just those who might be suffering that need a first look.\n“I ask patients at the highest risk, especially among the disabled, if they don’t have a cataract – another reason that every doctor wants to give them a second chance at vaccination,” says Dr. Tom Dornier, director of MCLA and author of “A Better, more affordable, preventive health shot program”\nDr. Matthew A. McQuaid, MCLA’s director of Community Based Therapeutics (CI), has been the first to advise women about vaccines.\nThe CI program works by prescribing pain medications to women and women who may be taking anti-inflammatories – those who’ve suffered from painful side effects such as weak stomach muscles or tendons – to prevent back pain. There are medications available to make sure women get a well-rounded vaccine through CI and cervical shot.\nThese are the first women’s shots that patients received from CI and given before their bodies started rejecting their anti-inflammatories, results in high-focal-nanolytic antibodies. If they don’t react, patients have a flu-like effect, resulting in serious side effects.\nIn determining what shots are best, health experts advise that women in their range of 85-90 days after they’ve been on anti-inflammatories face five weeks of best-case-before-they-disease prevention, with a red flag warning that they may have post-inhibitor side effects.\n“If they don’t adhere to their initial dose of antibiotics, they may feel better and maybe go home and take a shower,” says Dr. Johnson. “I urge women to talk with their physicians and if they have persistent side effects – it could be very dangerous to take these medications, which are highly recommended.”\nIf you or someone you know needs a shot, or someone you know has been diagnosed with illness, get tested or can show up at the CI clinic.

31,Angelina Jolie: What we must do for Afghan women,"['(CNN) — The advance of America and its alliance with China will slow and the process of progress toward a safe and stable Afghanistan will suffer.\n“That’s the nature of the beast,” said Malala Yousafzai, 10. “We must not let it deplete our potential as women.”\nMalala and her mother, Muhammad Yousafzai, the third Taliban leader to be killed since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, are in recent days bearing witness to the heroic effort by the United States and Afghanistan to make a difference for their oppressed brethren in the world’s poorest country.\nWhile government officials and the public of Afghanistan have encouraged violence against women, many foreign troops have been harshly criticized for sending in female support soldiers and for sometimes killing them. Many girls and women sit at remote tribal camps in neighboring Pakistan, where powerful tribes from neighboring Pakistan have allied with al Qaeda.\n“The insurgent women are completely separate, they don’t have anything to hide,” said Yousafzai. “They can act independently but don’t have the capacity to be taken from their families or fathers.”\nIn a message to her sisters, Yousafzai urged girls, even women, to prove their worth to protect one another: stand firm. She said she first learned about the use of extremism when she was in school. She said at one school rally when she was not permitted to speak she saw one of her classmates crying on the other side of the table.\n“We don’t know why this was happening. It’s not our fault, it’s not their fault,” she said. “We must be responsible to one another.”\nMalala spoke directly to the Taliban: that is to say, their influence is not limited to their online presence and popularity. A weekend of violence in Kabul and Swat this week took the lives of 18 people and wounded three, all men. Her protests, however, were outside Afghanistan’s limits.\n“A thousand these people must die in suicide attacks by suicide,” Yousafzai’s voice added. “How many people’s lives can we afford to put down to suicide attacks and renege on?”\nShe said the Afghan army would be the last word, but the trend it had to learn to counter, will ultimately be their undoing.\n“Futility of a nation is very, very important,” she said. “This country is invincible, it is the castle of the world, which, for a lot of people, is very important.”\nSince 2009, more than 8,000 Afghan women have been killed by extremists, according to Chaldean authorities.\nYousafzai recalled, as of late December, that she had gotten some help from girls. Her mother is fed from a small, hand-delivered canned fish. She said that she was concerned that “money will get lost” because of the violence.\n“We have been told we will get ahold of a donor like this,” Yousafzai said. “The fund, if it’s released, will send the money. But I don’t know how long.”\nShe said: “There’s a huge hunger for humanitarian work. …\n“What if we don’t have a job? It will not take a single day,” she said. “We will be millionaires and become the landlords of many more.”\nTo keep others out of the violence, Yousafzai said, she hoped that girls would encourage their young children to play by different rules.\nShe said her mother supports the Taliban, telling a meeting of international women’s groups that “war is a war. It is not over for everyone. But it should not be over for children.”\n“No child is spared,” she added. “You will be doing something better, whatever your life’s worth.”\nYousafzai advocates for Afghan women.\n“It’s our basic right to raise our children with dignity,” she said. “And it’s our responsibility to take care of the children when they are in danger.”\n']"

Institutional Films had a decent year with both domestic and international financial results, but they were badly hurt by impairment charges, one of our highest recorded, and from the North American and European regions.\nIn our new business in Brazil, this is what we think will take us from 2016 to 2017, in Brazil was very different than the last time we had sales. Now we have exited in Brazil a major competitor, in that respect. In an emerging market, once people will know more about its proven winners like we experienced in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that this business is a counter strategy.\nWhat is important is that we increased our circulation of news through the new BDTV and larger print services over the past year. This means that we were able to continue the rapid growth of our press and test BBS and online business, and small print and physical business.\nOur most significant acquisition was to purchase Kin Consulting in Canada in 2018. Kin Consulting offers a top-tier communications solution for media companies and media agencies, giving our media agencies greater visibility in the international markets, leveraging our extensive experience, expertise and relationships in media and communications.\nOne of our most important strategic partnerships and gains was our purchase of Marc-Andre in the United States. With a clear strategy for acquisitions, we are successfully combining our media and technology expertise with his expertise in media. We are also committed to partnering with Marc-Andre to expand our digital presence, because we believe this combination of our two strengths in Canada will strengthen our presence in the United States.\nThe story about the newly-disbanded Video.com, is not necessarily the story behind it, but a tale of convergence. It is a small company. What, I didn’t know that we had we not only merged with Video.com, but we had hired a new CEO. Marc-Andre’s focus was to use technology to create an attractive service for businesses across digital media, and video production. (our digital unit had been a company we controlled so I didn’t want to do a specialized deal for someone else. But this past quarter the company has had another impressive quarter, selling through the first quarter of 2014 that proves the company is still incredibly new.)\nI had the pleasure of speaking with Marc-Andre and asked him to write his new book. His enthusiasm and enthusiasm – as he likes to say, “social marketing.” He was very enthusiastic about the book and told me to read it, so I did.\nI think I know the underlying lessons and what we are hoping to learn from the upcoming year. Of course, sometimes a book is the only answer for a new problem. However, I did focus on the very early market challenges I worked against, and what we are using these as templates for future growth.\nYear-to-date, our sales rate for current business has increased, and we are using our strategy of strategically investing in the next six months and aggressively building upon our leadership and leadership momentum. The choices we are choosing this year are many. The best way to move forward will be with a strong execution and consolidation of resources which will allow us to be the best competitor, to grow our penetration and sell more to key global markets.\n']"

36,The movies that predicted an outbreak like coronavirus,"['I always expect more than one outbreak after each one.\nI’ve worked for several companies — GM Foods, Solicynews, Six Flags, Panera — which have been able to forecast more than one outbreak in more than 30 countries.\nUnfortunately, it’s not only these kinds of employees that have missed outbreaks, but also supervisors. Every company has an unannounced instance of crisis. It’s almost impossible to tell what’s behind it.\nA total of eight of our 11 diagnostic businesses have witnessed outbreaks, according to a CNN FactCheck investigation last week. Both Flint, Flint, Ohio, and Cleveland were seen months apart. Flint is also one of three jurisdictions nationwide that produce or manufacture recombinant bacterial strains of E. coli, according to a research paper from Global Health Dataset.\nSo what kind of outbreaks we have experienced? It’s relatively simple: A large majority of the outbreak comes from a small number of labs across the country. In Mississippi, there have been 16 outbreaks of E. coli in 44 states. In Alaska, there have been five reports of a freeze-up outbreak, and four of the five clusters in New Hampshire have been confirmed.\nPeople in more developed countries have reported outbreaks more than 30 times in different geographic areas. The main reason? In developing countries, outbreaks of E. coli can be traced to abroad. In major IAEA member states, in clinical emergencies, outbreaks are reported from local sources.\nIn the US, 25 outbreaks of E. coli have been recorded. In Iceland, there have been more than 20 reports of more than one outbreak. In Ireland, a complete list of more than 20 outbreaks has been compiled. When you add these outbreaks to reports of a similar outbreak, it’s a lot more likelier that you find outbreaks in other countries.\nIn Canada, a total of 39 outbreaks have been recorded.\nIn Western Europe, outbreaks have been reported when local ones happen before this outbreak has grown. But the following countries have had major outbreaks:\nDavos\nGlen Dorough\nKaty Hope\nJennie Bell\nJulian Wole\nLate\nLudwig Johnsen\nEdmund Groppinger\nFemi Kuehne\nWho can say with confidence about what happened at the Pittsburgh Food Group in 2013? In a separate CNN FactCheck investigation, The Washington Post reported on just three or four outbreaks in 2016. That means 9,163 cases have been reported and more than 275 illness warnings.\nThe following is from a 2013 CNN report, making no mention of any of the outbreaks in Western Europe:\nLike many of the countries, Western Europe has a very strong code of conduct for outbreaks.\nA BuzzFeed story reported that Lehigh County administration officials missed the First World War outbreak of tuberculosis in 1903, according to a 2016 NPR profile.\nOur research at RightHand, a nonprofit based in Fergus, Ireland, found similar trends with respect to outbreaks in Asia. In early 2017, we reported on a virus outbreak that has caused about 350 illnesses in 13 countries. All of the outbreaks reported were health-related.\nI don’t think an outbreak of Zika can be estimated as high as 2014 because we had such high infections when the outbreak was less severe. Similarly, we have seen increases in obesity, the human-peptide-nutritional value factor, and other obesity-related diseases since the 2010 outbreaks.\nFor an outbreak to catch on the scale of a normal outbreak, it has to have included some major outbreaks that do not exist before. The goal, then, is to prepare the public for these outbreaks.\nOf course, not everyone can detect a virus early. They can fail to alert the public, lose trust in reporting, or even want to risk police action. Especially once serious illnesses are suspected, coverage of outbreaks can shrink. But just as an outbreak of Ritz, summer fever, or Cold War-era toxins prevented large outbreaks, so could come from a virus far from sick.\n']"

Instead of doing the baddie with a villainous looks, Dekker looks much younger and much more capable of delivering gritty mischief.\n""Bloodshot"" was ""Kangaroo Court"" director Scott Eastwood’s 2013 remake of “The History Boys.” Though ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" and ""Meet the Spartans"" lead from the film, the title character hadn’t appeared onscreen since the title was changed.\nDirected by ""Gunsmoke"" and ""King Kong"" lead Danai Gurira, the series wasn’t originally supposed to be a live-action movie. However, all three films are made from small-screen material and serve to bring new talent to the screen to fill in for either villain.\nPHOTOS: Top 10 Marvel Comics Films of All Time\n""I’ve done things for four or five years now,” Ridley Scott said about the likelihood of him directing a video game. “I just think there are a bunch of times you can come back to the old world and not interact with that.

41,'A Quiet Place II' release delayed by coronavirus,"['(CNN) — ""A Quiet Place II"" was delayed by the coronavirus, it was revealed Monday, less than three weeks after its U.S. box office debut.\nThe delay was driven by rising chills for the American movie whose makers said the virus had taken over the system that controls production.\nThe update to the film, created by the tech industry is ""certainly not covered by the virus"" affecting any of the film\'s actors, producers said. And it was not revealed to be the cause of the delay.\nViruses can cause fatal lung infections, flesh-eating diseases and even mysterious cancers, according to the World Health Organization. These types of viruses don\'t appear to be directed by an individual. They are dormant in the body, making it harder to predict exactly when they will cause harm.\nThe virus that insiders say brought the ICP in this film\'s production has now infected nearly 10,000 people, affecting over half a million who have taken care of it, according to a preliminary investigation.\n""We are unaware of any deaths, but unfortunately there is no hospital treatment,"" Scranton, Pennsylvania-based Universal Pictures said in a statement.\nThe delay comes nearly five years after the ICP was discovered in living mice, the rare mutation that is the hallmark of an isolated coronavirus of the same name.\nMultiple Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials released the official report explaining how a coronavirus that appeared in mouse colonies on television in 2014 had spread to infect at least 150 countries. A team of 68 CDC officials was also involved in the research.\nThe CDC officials said an investigation revealed that coronavirus testing in humans is well enough advanced to know it wasn\'t just the mouse\'s immune system that created the virus.\nCNN reached out to the makers for comment but was not immediately able to reach a representative, Daren Tsui, the acting director of the CDC. He told CNET in an email that the company continues to investigate the investigation into the incident and many others that followed.\n""We are working closely with our laboratory partners to identify the cause and patient histories and other relevant local and national information from a timely test procedure so we can determine the cause and effect of this recent viral outbreak,"" he wrote.\n']"

43,Pete Davidson doesn't exactly stretch much in 'Big Time Adolescence',"['For those of you without a smartphone, surfing the net, binge-watching your favorite shows or chatting to up your friends, you’re in luck: you have a virtual Jack Russell Terrier named Donny in the movie Big Time Adolescence.\nSeriously, for non-prime-time comers, it seems like Donny is kind of the sure-fire poster child for the internet’s shtick of juvenile, slapstick, borderline offensive jokes.\nSure, his interactions with the people he meets (who, I know, are similar to us, but their appeal is much more specific) are essentially non-existent in “Trolls” and “Potterheads,” but the character is actually comedic and stunningly human.\nPerhaps he and Ray Bradbury would have created a nicer reputation for Donny in the 1980s than himself and Jake Gyllenhaal, the actor known for a vocal singing voice in “Baby Love.” Donny seems to be a lovable type, not spiteful.\nSound familiar? While talking to one of the two characters, Daniel Dae Kim, Donny is able to articulate that his aim is for Ray Bradbury’s “Do the Right Thing” and put so much effort into it that he looks and acts like none other than three giant puppet ears with the occasional you-know-what at their mercy.\nDonny would easily be the best of the family in “Trolls,” and its precise opening scene about a pair of human kids playing carnival sports is kind of gross.\nSmashing down candles\nDonny is not a person, unlike most puppet/monster characters, that is actually scary. The juxtaposition with “Big Time Adolescence” sends a perfectly justified sense of dread and guilt: death, I know, but are you just like me when I wake up tomorrow and find a pool of scary twins hovering around my head?\nDonny doesn’t seem to have inherited the nastiness of the “Trolls” character. These adorable kids are cruelly being yanked by Donny’s late mother, and it’s become a point of tension not only with Donny but with everyone around them.\nEven Donny’s father Paul likes him.\nThe fact that Donny is much more aware of the fact that Benji [his onscreen dad], who is stuck with the only thing that will help him out from the insanity is pinching us, is not enough to make the “Trolls” character any less awful.\nDonny is not just looking to fit in. He wants to live his life to the fullest, and as such, it’s quite scary that Donny might morph into a bear.\nReally, there’s nothing really like a “Trolls” character in movies that need to grow into their nuanced, realistic selves. The colors and the songs make the character all the more complicated.\nIn “Trolls,” the slight, indispensable addition is that Donny recognizes our loneliness, and he doesn’t just accept it as part of life, but even among the other humans. And while we’re at it, Donny fills Donny with a poignancy about his vulnerability.\nDonny’s relationship with Ray Bradbury\nI know they got to do a superb job of capturing the fact that a person with a digitally homogenized face has tremendous power, but maybe Donny can help amp up the illusion.\nAs does his father Paul, who is supposed to be Donny’s way of expressing his feelings.\nWith this monologue put together, Donny and Ray try to cope with the reality that we feel as though we really only have one identity: we feel way too much.\nJust don’t go to the movies with us.\n']"
44,Serena Williams to spend the next 6 weeks in solitude,"['Time for tennis. Tennis fans will be able to enjoy the benefits of a less stressful day on the court and the melancholy and pain of the past few years better than ever. Not just a sport, but a life that evokes pure, matter-of-fact awe.\nNo, tennis isn’t about something special – a few former champions have their tennis — only about moving away for extended periods or endings. Rather, it’s about the isolation it allows. Think a void or giant tan-streaked forest in Sweden, or the birds that walk atop the pink oranges.\nIt’s the isolation that makes life worthwhile.\nWhile tennis is a year-round sport, it’s also about our vulnerable heartstrings (cycling or golfing or skiing). Players find anonymity and tools to connect with others.\nFor Nikki Daivari, happiness has come a long way, since she moved from South Africa to Italy to play to support her brothers and the business of sating and being a sportswoman. It took time and organization to get her back into the league, but she did get a promotion for the first time as a 16-year-old, which felt like her smallest victory ever.\nJaime Corbella, who’s best friends with the college women’s team in Italy, received a promotion. Corbella, then a junior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says she’s glad she played tennis.\n“After playing tennis for a couple of years I would really like to,” she said. “So it was really great for me. I really like to watch tennis. I have a lot of friends who are tennis players.”\nCorbella moved to Italy to take advantage of a new opportunity. She says her heart is still in Italy, and she just wants to swim or ride a bike. But the prospect of a more physical life and an amount of time away from the likes of Michael Phelps, is never much fun.\n“I’m always a little scared of swimming,” she said. “They said I shouldn’t do that, they were just thinking I was a little scared. But I don’t even notice how much it makes me want to give up.”\nSo she and her two high school buddies, Emma Watson and Justin Gatlin, opened a tennis club in summer 2017, and they’ve grown to share the experience and encouragement they get along with tennis.\n“We all enjoy tennis,” Watson said. “There’s that teen personality, me as a teenager who loves it. I am a huge admirer. I was thinking of Piers Morgan a few years ago when I was in a promotional role for WonderCon. I had met him. I asked if he could come to one of my events and he was very sweet.”\nEighteen-year-old Dyan Kovan, the team’s seventh-grade junior, will compete at Level 1 this summer at Canyon Meadows. But Kovan’s place is, well, hers.\nTo make Kovan, a former UCLA and USC star, feel more of a player, she will need to sign all seven of her junior and senior letters of recommendation by now. Kovan hopes to become a U.S. Open winner. She says, “My second goal is to go to the elite level. My goals are to improve a little bit as an athlete and play a little bit more tennis. I’m trying to achieve the goals you’d want.”\nAnd finally, there’s Ajay Singh, who is on top.\nSingh, who has been playing tennis for the last 13 years, has survived the stress of rising to the top in the world and is on the verge of making it all the way to the final of his first ATP U.S. Open.\n“After about a year, I got no friends and I just began playing every day,” he said. “Then I moved into a locker room at one of the tennis arenas. I was playing each match on the same court. You get full control.”\nHe still gets frustrated with his inability to finish one set in a row – trying to get his team to finish the last and that’s a challenge that that crowd, satisfied with the sensation, is putting on.\n“There’s always a worry in the gym,” he said. “You just want the team to just be up and going.

46,'Riverdale' halts Season 4 production over coronavirus,"['by Tracy Schwartz\nEditor, Disney XD\nGoodby Silverstein and Alan Horn are doing their best to keep Matt McGinnis around. In order to help the latest efforts to relocate the “Riverdale” cast from the Seattle area back to Los Angeles to begin shooting this fall, they’ve decided that it’s not “safe” to leave the USA television series.\n“We have an incident to answer,” Silverstein told Deadline in Los Angeles, which reported Tuesday that the cast had come to the studio to check on McGinnis, who suffered a medical-induced infection. “There is no reason to leave him where he is,” Silverstein said.\nFor more, check out the 90-second clip below.\nThe delay is from the intention to change the location of the New York premiere from Seattle to L.A. This could mean several additional episodes have to be filmed at Century City or elsewhere. The novel “Riverdale” was ordered for syndication in 2012 and was scheduled to air on American TV in 2013.\nAs a writer/producer for the TV series, Silverstein has spent the last 10 years feeling left out of the creative process because the new batch of episodes is such a large budget. We couldn’t help but notice, however, that the episodes about the characters — who may be fictional — are often shot right in the studio.\n“Riverdale” was originally produced for a limited run, but network executives have decided to cancel it.\n“Riverdale” is part of USA’s Scoop TV, a digital format around information and entertainment in which TV series are released without the rest of the TV content.\nAs for whether or not the move will impact the finale of “Riverdale,” Silverstein is still hopeful for her characters.\n“You just can’t leave your characters behind,” she told Deadline. “As long as people keep doing that and the show continues, there is definitely still plenty of time left. And right now, I think, at least they’ve seen all the advertisements and kept everybody motivated.”\n']"

48,Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson: What we know,"['Remember the movie thriller All the President’s Men? HBO’s The Leftovers?! HBO’s fresh new crime drama? Here are some of the things we’ve learned about the cast of “The Leftovers.”\nDirector Justin Theroux told Deadline he wanted to “take the idea of a new take” and “pull what was already established with a ton of timelines in the game.” If you’re unfamiliar with the show, it centers on a couple of New York City cop-swapping hacks who must change the definition of what constitutes “a good cop” in a shrinking world — and yet it feels like there’s something to be said for cops: love an imperfect hero, let’s face it, like Cleopatra on ice. We did get to see, by the end of the first season, one of the most beautifully talented, resonant actors working today.\nA new online ad for the show debuted Wednesday. It’s called “Artist Led and Powerful” and has 10,000 words in it: “Here’s a picture of us together at the end of ‘The Leftovers’ and it speaks to our real, powerful, powerful selves.”\nThe show’s slogan: “There is no love among us.”\nIt says something about us as artists: We’re captured, violated, with no love for us. That is disturbing, because that’s not the message that “The Leftovers” feels meant to convey. The hope is that we’ll change as we move forward. At this point in our lives, just getting to stop and think about what it was like to get to the bottom of the story is pretty important.\nThe show leaves us on a different trajectory than we are currently giving ourselves. We’re constantly imagining this big story, like that unfolding on its own in a massive puzzle. For us, everything in this season is a piece of cake. The answer to our question is from the outside.\nHBO learned “the world loves us first” in the games of knocking down the Oculus. Here’s what that meant: Whoa!\nA “safe space”\nIt would be easy to get pushed away from the “safe zone” in “The Leftovers” on a strictly practical basis. Something about being in “Moby Dick” is, in all at once, a seismic tectonic shift. We’re moving from understanding George Clooney, to being able to imagine Clooney inside a vacuum instead of eating it, imagining this. Anything. Everything.\nIt would not be true for us on the show, yet. As we sit there hoping it won’t happen, fearing the worst of the worst and all along being surrounded by people, maybe even assuming we’re unhinged on the phone, experiencing the worst that’s out there while the other people still want to talk to us. If there’s hope for these characters, it’s certainly there. Because this is us.\nWe are not just captives in this saga.\nFor us, where we are in this story, we are also what it is that we are. We aren’t based on or about the general populace.

49,Kate Beckinsale posts powerful response to Harvey Weinstein's prison sentence,"['By Alison Williams\n(CNN) — A scathing letter published online Thursday shows Kate Beckinsale getting resolute on the court\'s sentencing of former Weinstein producer Harvey Weinstein.\n""The personal consequences of their heinous conduct will not be calculated, nor will their ability to eliminate them,"" the director wrote in a tearful, lengthy letter to U.S. District Judge Alice Wells.\nBeckinsale, who famously played Alice Cooper in the 1980s Broadway musical ""Midnight Memories,"" said in a statement from her lawyers, ""I am grateful for those who made these senseless decisions and by extension my family — my colleague, my parents, sisters, brothers, my brother, my wife, and my current and unborn-child. These suffering people deserve better. We deserve better.""\nThere were other tweets Tuesday that included a photo of the actress asking the judge to ""open up his public bench to the world and every person who feels it\'s necessary for people to come forward.""\nThere also were damning remarks about Weinstein from a former colleague at the studio that were deleted after he became the next director on the film.\n""He could be doing this, in the best interests of me,"" Ridley Scott\'s black-and-white sports film ""Alien"" was shown to audiences at the time of its release.\nAn open court is a rarity in Hollywood, where there\'s a general public sense of expectancy at what could go wrong. But in this case, much of the publicity was largely about acknowledging the gravity of the crimes Weinstein has faced and the challenges they face in their profession.\nThe actress added, ""I was shocked and betrayed by some of the decisions the judge made to discipline the individuals he held responsible for the crime.""\nIn the letter, Beckinsale recounted the years she spent in a ""secret holding pen"" with Weinstein, at the Temple of Bess in New York, where they met for the first time at the afterparty preceding the movie\'s release in 2005.\nShe recounted how Weinstein started dropping her off at the establishment when they were both still teenagers.\n""You and I had never really crossed paths in any way,"" she said. ""It was mostly a verbal exchange between us. I suppose that part of the process you had to re-enter the agency.""\nBeckinsale took aim at Weinstein\'s ""marvellous"" film career, saying he produced ""dark and deranged films like ""The Departed,"" ""Disgrace,"" ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"" ""The Hateful Eight,"" ""Lincoln,"" ""Lincoln"" and ""The Ides of March.""\n""I feel for those women who have been sexually assaulted and for those women who were not specifically targeted, because I believe their fates were intertwined,"" she said.\nBeckinsale wrote that he ""dropped his shoes … at the heels of my own shoes and walked through the gate at the crack of dawn and into the evening and said, \'Enough.\' I pulled out my, skinny blouse and jeans and I sat there. Well, maybe because I didn\'t know.""\n""I don\'t want you guys to think me looking back at this is my fault or if I was doing what you were doing, but it was. I don\'t care, I loved it. It was a dream.""\nOn Wednesday, Weinstein spoke to CNN\'s ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" outside the courtroom.\n""We were talking about the charges that I pled guilty to, I\'m sorry, we were discussing an investigation,"" Weinstein said, who, like Beckinsale, also received ""treatment"" for his behavior.\n""We spoke about the case. I was very much on board with this conversation, and I did try to think of something to do with this. I wanted to do everything in my power to make this conversation good.""\nBeckinsale did not take the opportunity to comment.\nBut on Tuesday, Weinstein said the seriousness of his crimes is a goal he\'s trying to uphold.\n""If I put it best, we still have to live together and if I live together with these three women, they can still come forward, at least for me — this is my thing.""\n""We want it to be the open court and all of us can have a conversation,"" he said.

A series of nine shows debut on June 21, all of which are comedies.\nAll are written by Democrats David Dimitriades and David McKelvey, and are marked by a titular theme that audiences will follow.\nKen Green, who is gay, and singer Tommy Lee Jones perform for both NBCUniversal and Netflix.\nThe ratings for ""The View"" are low, but that doesn\'t worry the White House, which has been trying for months to get more TV money for its social programs. But this shows they will not be content with dipping viewers back into programs that we watch on TV for entertainment.\n""The View"" has been a ratings juggernaut for the network for four decades, reaching a viewership of 7.1 million viewers a week, according to Nielsen data.\nIndeed, while ""The View"" got a whole new amount of attention during its first season, the show has clearly lost its luster. The line between pop culture and comedy has been cut, but the hits remain intact, given the country\'s popularity with the entertainment industry. ""View"" remains a laugh-out-loud hit for 21st Century Fox, NBC Universal and CBS.\nOddly enough, ""View"" also found a way to add humor after it started its marketing blitz: Robin Roberts, still a Black Star.\n""Robin Roberts was one of the first black women in entertainment, and she took the baton a bit,"" Pankaj Advani, vice president and general manager of NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment, told the Associated Press. ""There was some humor in Robin Roberts as well. But we also started telling stories. She was just stunning, and the key to bringing in advertisers and promotions is to open minds and create humor. That\'s what the \'View\' has been offering.""\nYet for some, ""View"" will seem like a lost opportunity.\n""The View"" may have created a new image for itself, but ABC had hoped the characters represented on the program would bolster ratings.\nMegan Fox has long said the show evolved from a depiction of a subservient White House view of Hollywood. That era -- the McCarthy era -- was dominated by politicians who controlled power from the Oval Office for decades.\nHere are four White House-era shows that would work better in your living room:\n""Terms of Endearment""\nYes, ""Terms of Endearment"" is a comedy about the executive who romantically accuses the member of Congress and the press of having sexual conquests. Some might say the series highlights this particular man, but even the gay audience probably won\'t help this one.\n""Terms of Endearment"" has stars Bill Pullman, Zoe Saldana and Gloria Delgado-Pritchett playing a largely straight man from the San Francisco to Washington, D.C. That suggests its writer Daniel Valsky isn\'t afraid to embrace the male-centric approach to storytelling, rather than usher in a new era for male characters.\nThis might be the best show to have left for TV in years, but it still has many drama subplots and comedy. In ""Terms of Endearment,"" the popular Dr. Oliver North is portrayed by Ryan Murphy, who is the Emmy winner behind shows like ""Ugly Betty."" The series\' recurring segment examines the relationship between the man trying to woo Dr. Oliver and the male journalist.\n""Colbert Report""\nThis is another ""talk show."" The ""Colbert Report"" segment may have a gentler working relationship with politics than its predecessor. According to The Wall Street Journal, researchers for a new study commissioned by Comedy Central and broadcast news-talk shows said Colbert\'s show, which averaged 13.6 million viewers a week during its ""Colbert Report"" run, was not only critical, but up 21% from a year ago.\n""Colbert Report"" is a punchy, political comedy about the movements of everyday people, including the American Civil Liberties Union and white supremacists.

His sentence, set for next month, is longer than the 11 years served by federal prosecutors.\nHow Weinstein escaped\nThe Weinstein Company, the Weinstein Co. and the Weinstein Company owned by Weinstein had previously been accused of sexual misconduct with women.\nIn December 2017, a jury convicted Weinstein of criminal sexual assault and tampering with evidence. The company continued to sell its Weinstein trademarks for decades.\nWeinstein said in an interview published Monday in The New York Times that he was in the habit of drinking whiskey and smoking.\n“Those cocktails were totally physical,” he said. “People might say these things but they didn’t do anything about it. I was in the habit of drinking alcohol the whole time. I didn’t drink.”\nThe treatment of women in the #MeToo movement was also something on which he had been highly criticized, prompting some to question his treatment of women by female executives at his company.\nThe director was also facing a full civil trial in October. In October, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Anna Throne-Holst imposed strict punishment for the groping scandal that has rocked Hollywood.\nThe judge set a Sept. 7 trial date and an April 19 trial date.\nWeinstein is the highest-profile of six Weinstein executive pairs who reached settlements with victims.\nWeinstein also released his name from a nondisclosure agreement with two of his accusers.\nAn earlier version of this story included Weinstein's lawyer recanting his earlier statement.\n""]"

58,Kumail Nanjiani recreated buff movie scenes because we still deserve nice things,"['If you’re any type of moviegoer, you’ve always been told to treat yourself well when the movie goes on the road. And we’ve never seen anything like anything like what Kumail Nanjiani did, at least in the feature film’s third act.\nThe Boston Globe points out, while the film directed by Rian Johnson may have a strong sci-fi component, it’s not exactly a subtle satire or satire of Twitter. You will have to pick up a Chinese wall ($8,500.)\nWhat many viewers will be interested in seeing more of is the two-dimensional, bad-guy versions of Bryan Cranston and Donald Glover, the two actors who play the characters side by side in order to get to the end of the movie. Cranston really gives an expression to the film that sounds like Cranston uses to say to each other, “You must have had this conversation with my wife.”\nBut Nanjiani offered up more of a description in a new interview with CNN:\nDid you see it? I did. No, I didn’t have this conversation with my wife.\nDid you think the script was written right or wrong? In other words, no — I never thought that it was going to be anything that made the first movie a decent or worthwhile movie. There was not enough material where we could keep it going for half a century.\nWhy did you want to do it? Because I’m an actor. I love movies. I love people. I’m like, “I’ve read the book I want to write.”\nAnd it became so rich. I spent hours just in this office doing these lines for this big-budget film and so it was a good experience. But what made it so fun to do it was, you did have to throw yourself into it. I didn’t want to go and do it again and again.\nIt became this kind of retreads and rewrites and reworkings and all that stuff. So it became about us filling in the holes, giving the actors room to think and to play with each other.\nIt was about actual change. Change in a way — and this is where things start to happen. Just about that same point as I was 15, about, “What’s happening this week? What’s going to happen next?” We don’t know. We don’t know much, so all we know is we’re in this real world that it’s me telling, “What are you doing now?”\nAnd that’s where it goes on a real world level and the actors do get to play with each other. So that kind of thing, I was more interested in playing with all the different dialogue in this movie. You know, it’s what it’s like to be an actor and to be that person who brings so much of that to it. And that kind of character works in some cases better than others, and it’s about showing it.\nIn the movie, there are a few different characters. For instance, Tien Chien and the character they play in The Commissary in Interstellar was that one of the characters named Brody, the father of a young boy. And there are other characters who were named Reince, the younger brother of the character named Eric. So there are different aspects of the same character.\nWhat’s going on with these characters of yours in the movie? I’m not sure. I’m pretty sure their careers and the kind of backgrounds that they have in their life, even though they are movie players, sometimes some of the things that get written in there, are very veiled.\nIt’s a story about birth by birth, which is kind of hard for people to fathom or even understand. What they’re most comfortable with is being people and being alive in your own skin, and just that’s the real story here.\nEven though they probably are trying to cross that line, you guys don’t want to cross that line with that. It’s important, it’s important that these characters are not like you guys. It’s important that them have the intention that they would be an actor. And then you can’t argue with that, when your characters are smart and know the rules.\n']"

Most of those “lattles, to the tune of $22 million a season,” as most people call them, will be available with “what I know.”\nViewers don’t really want to hang out with old “what is” guys (that really is our default terminology here). But it’s an opportunity for those who want to tell you about other men.\nThe network’s newest series, “Superhero Place,” is one of a bunch of the silver, black and white TV dramas on premiere night.\nThe series shows four guys who are not “quite crazy” about having a baby, the creators promise. Often that’s because the decisions have changed. Sometimes, they use “how they’ve been brought up and what’s going on in their lives” to make a difference.\n“It really does have a sense of a lot of the characters we’re exploring, and as writers we love bringing those people into a show that’s about them,” says Paul Jacoby, one of the show’s stars. “I think that our first season is so [fantastic], so I thought it should be as satisfying as possible for fans.”\nAmong the highlights of the season:\n– The discovery that Serena Sorvino (Amanda Seyfried) is pregnant. She’s quickly found out she is pregnant. “We’re seeing things that will shape us in the future,” says executive producer Charlotte Riley.\n– It’s parents Jason Brooks (Jonathan Crane) and Anna Tashniak (Haley Bennett) who inadvertently catch the toddler’s eye.\n– Anna saves Steve Engleman (Chris Miller) from a kidnapping. The teen’s dad is trying to take her back. Also: “OK, now is that something you can support?” “Wait, it really is,” says David O'Donnell (My Harlan Hunt), a mastermind behind the show.\n– The brothers and mysterious villains are back. “We don’t just cast these guys,” says Riley. “We get it.”\n– Gabriel (Tinsel McBride) and Adonis (Mia Wasikowska) are friends. “We were thrown together the first time,” says Riley.\n– Mark Lytle, whose part in “The Shining” is an improv coach, is the show’s emcee. “We all got together just to say some stuff,” says McBride. “It was really cool.”\nShows don’t always come naturally to TV news these days, but an episode of “Modern Family” gave us the opportunity to watch which finalists are never more attractive to reality.\nIt doesn’t always make sense to have a pretty face on the surface – often, it can be rather awkward. But in many ways, this show is more purposeful in the way it tells a story.\nIt offers an array of options: There’s a rowdy, burn-crazy bar scene, an open, darkly murderous music scene and a carnival stunt man’s take on the ultimate death-end road.\nThis is not just a show about a girl who dreams of marrying a high-schooler, which might be a tribute to TV history – but it’s one with a lot of great shows that could eventually make their way in the director’s chair.\n“Superhero Place” will premiere on broadcast TV on May 17th.\n""]"

Because people like to believe it can be fun if there’s just one winner, you may be skeptical that the show will go on without the older generation.\nBut a recent ABC News special from “American Idol” appears to tell viewers just how accurate the final-night contestants are.\nPERFECT TV SHOWS TO ADDRESS THE TUNES\n“American Idol” features a clock that pollsters use to survey viewers through newscasts, social media and websites. It uses a computer program to highlight the TV’s best spots to randomly go on the air and provide a quick summary, plus rate those spots and context.\nThe same devices that churn out ratings tell pollsters the research they used to value TV shows in the past was based on the ratings’ strongest spots. The commercials are screened not just based on the ratings, but also on language, character description and cadence, along with the influences on setting up the shows.\nAN EXCELLENT WAY TO VIEW\nTV shows can’t quite be narrated, but at some point they can be “shocked” by the past history they share. They can be told how TV doctors talked about the future and how Americans were meeting with the future when the 1960s and 1970s swept the country. And sometimes, in case there’s any doubt in your mind — all the winners are old, and the winners are new — you can peek into the mind-blowing lives of pioneers and engineers, engineers and engineers who helped America accumulate greatness.\nTICKETS FOR “THERE ARE WATCHING SEATS?”\nWhile some people may deny the shows exist, they’re selling seats because they think they can make your life interesting by knowing the specific specifics. A book is always available to talk about TV with them, but it can be hard to predict who will and won’t attend. Tickets to the New York premiere of the “American Idol” season 21 set for May 3 aren’t included.\nOUR TIME MOST VALUABLE MACHINE TO VIEW\nIn season 18 of “American Idol,” one of America’s greatest sitcoms, “Dear Abby,” all viewers get to see is when they look at the master-slave table set. They can be bombarded with their favorite songs and every imaginable number, and the television script can take thousands of years to get there.\nFans of the show think it’s a gift because it’s dedicated to moving with the times, whether it’s listening to the Beatles or watching Frederick Douglass on an 18th-century radio station, or hearing an echo of the seaside music business\nTHERE ARE TWO BOATS\nJenny McCarthy actually goes on a flippant rant about people lying and calling life cruel, quite a departure from the “Super Bowl” era. But for our purposes, the “KHORGO” series is an historical period piece, and we watch it because it describes life in America without commentary, reporting, or telling.\nThe series – aired on Fox in October – covered more than 80 countries, including, as one fan describes it, 40 in total.\n']"

The Banker is that movie — new to iTunes.\nThe banker, starring Chris O\'Dowd as Louis the Banker, comes from Award-winning director and screenwriter Chris Miller (Meet the Spartans, Blades of Glory) and features some rare starpower.\nO\'Dowd is a 30-year-old jazz guitar player who has been working all over the world after being a gap year for play clubs in Chicago and Nashville.\nHe\'s played a gaggle of thespians, oddball girls and rich folk in ""The Banker."" He joins a group of fine Englishmen going on an eight-week residency in New York City.\nDuring their tour, these six global scholars gathered for talks to learn some music, research about the instrument, perform a hilarious harmonies.\nIt was a band like that that caught O\'Dowd\'s attention as he was driving up to a recording studio to tape his two-minute run.\n""I didn\'t have an interest in playing instruments at that time; this was our last time doing it,"" he says. ""That led me to the idea of this film and I think it\'s getting back on track in a lot of ways.""\n']"
63,"Al Pacino hunts Nazis in 'Hunters,' a series whose premise tops its execution","['A new crime series from “Arrested Development” creator Mitch Hurwitz has thrust boxing to the forefront of the entertainment world — but what viewers here may have seen early on was just as effective.\nThe seven-part production debut of “Hunters” aired from 9 p.m. Monday to midnight on the Starz network and the USA Network, and made it clear that HBO isn’t ready to put cop shows on its schedule.\nProceeds from the pilot show will go into support and development of numerous productions from the show, and it’s bringing together a group of award-winning filmmakers, choreographers, actors, writers and more who will serve as advisors and mentors for the winners, who are then judged by IAF employees.\n“Hunters” (and M: Night) debuted on Starz and USA in 2016 with the sweeping series series “Alcatraz” starring Abbie Cornish and Mark Wahlberg. The second installment of “Alcatraz” follows the story of two gated prisoners, played by Watson, who seek refuge with their wives on Alcatraz after being incarcerated for 10 years.\nDeadline reports that M: Night was largely financed by the movie and Emmy-winning production company Greg Berlanti, and Viacom and all partner companies are involved. Like “Arrested Development,” the new series will be a mere pilot for Starz and other premium pay networks.\nFor more on the show, click here.\n']"
64,'Onward' continues Pixar's apparent quest to make us cry,"['“Along the road, there’s the ragtag gang that zits and has them murdering someone, shooting people when they are eating out, robbing fast food places when they are being all drunk in the parking lot, robbing the women’s restrooms and bathrooms in the morning, killing people and raping women,” wrote popular author Geordie Shore star Charlotte Crosby in a blog post on today’s Today show.\n“And then there’s the band of bad dudes who go around eating shrimp from the dogs and actually shooting these people who have been raped, murdered, drunk and were gay but now they look like much more attractive female animals now,” she continued.\nMolly Sims, husband of America’s most famous sitcom actress Caroline Simons, jumped on the high-powered bandwagon.\nSimons, who recently hosted Comcast’s “X Factor: X Factor” — a special guest job on today’s show — told CQ Breakfast earlier this week that she has never felt unsafe, let alone comfortable on the job. She noted that she even came off as suicidal.\n“I’m not going to preach this or — oh, not in the most spiritual way — I don’t want to make you feel comfortable in some way,” she said, adding that “this is my job.”\nBack at Today, Tina Fey again emphasized that the reason why she’s here is because she cares.\n“It was more than my career, it was how I feel about the area — and this was my job,” she said, adding that she feels the need to “make people feel safe.”\nTonight’s “Good Morning America” also addressed the “do you think it will be good to go to Disneyland with Megan Fox” before their co-star Buzz Lightyear brought the ensemble to try and win favor with the middle-aged crowd that CMCG told them to watch (albeit “breathlessly,” in which case, no laughing).\n']"
65,'Little America' brings a warm look at immigrant stories to Apple TV+,"['CNET\nApple’s TV is getting another twist with this week’s launch of the new streaming device, a controversial device that includes a guide about the American Dream.\nWith the choice of HomePod, an Apple TV plug-in that connects to your PC through an internet connection, or a 32-bit modem that runs a monitor, the Apple TV comes with an advanced design that highlights your dreams.\nApple and Amazon soon became the first manufacturers to jointly show off the home smart TV, according to an interview with Amazon’s Jeff Bezos on GeekWire Friday.\nAmazon and Apple weren’t specific about anything the companies announced.\nApple TV appeared on WatchABC during WatchFox.com’s All Things D broadcast, according to Amazon and WatchFox.com.\nApple wasn’t clear where it wanted to show the device to start and ended up taking the “Okay,” move somewhat forward, according to recent reports. But after the brief introduction, Apple began to talk about developing its own set-top box, according to GeekWire.\nApple and Amazon are also holding a conference next month, which will explore how consumers interact with the TV in real time.\n“We are constantly working on a lot of different things with our content providers and our software,” said John Choi, Apple’s vice president of TV advertising, at the Electronic Gaming Association’s eGames conference in San Francisco this week.\n“We’ve been working on this ever since the beginning. We have a lot of technology that we’re working on, so we’re going to be updating this in the next month.”\nApple has expressed some concerns about a remote, led by experienced technology vendors. Amazon is bringing its Alexa voice assistant, dubbed Alexa Prime, and will start introducing Apple Pay users to Apple TV’s collection of smart speakers this month.\nApple’s home smart TV will no doubt spark a bidding war for the home streaming services. The former data storage company Dropbox purchased by Apple for $3.3 billion last year, according to Fortune.\nGoogle, Amazon, and Microsoft offer high-quality TV and internet video service that are streamed to devices connected to a computer, according to Google. Microsoft and Microsoft are jointly doing battle with Netflix, among others.\niWatch photo gallery\n']"
66,"The Fastest Way To Pay Off $10,000 In Credit Card Debt","['Michelle Geller, author of “Why Women Should Be Listed As High School Graduates” spoke with CNNMoney about the dangers of excessive borrowing and how she came up with this tip.\nYou live in New York City, right?\nWell, I know it sounds horrible. But the fact is, there’s millions of people who come into New York City with no intention of robbing their friends, or being met at a bar in the afternoon with a record five dollars in their pockets. And those numbers have grown tremendously. Not only can the vast majority of adults have missed out on half a billion dollars in credit card debt, but the amount of money that’s left over after taxes is almost three times higher than the amount spent on gas. So it’s amazing to me that a lot of people who got as much money as they could can, in just two seconds, stack their cards and come up with a bunch of money.\nMore than $10,000 in credit card debt\nThe biggest big payoff was in the first $500 of Geller’s book, “Why Women Should Be Listed As High School Graduates.” She hopes that book and this tip will inspire young women to become more responsible as they enter adulthood.\nThe Tip: Look Into The Collection. Forget “T” and “K” like “D” in your credit card statements. Focusing on what you already have will allow you to qualify as high school graduate debt during the first year, and in the next year and a half, as Geller said, “you’ll really begin to understand what’s really important and who you are in your life.”\nProtect Yourself From Debt\nPeople are important, but why should they risk it? Although there’s no silver bullet when it comes to protecting yourself, starting conversations on credit cards and other issues with your bank could result in more savings. “I have found that 12 to 15 minutes of discussing a personal financial issue with your bank without having to put a personal trip or auto trip on hold while making payments helps increase the confidence you have in yourself during the course of your life,” said Caitlin Barnes, a corporate communications manager at Jackson Heights, N.Y.-based retirement startup, Formspring Corp. “People don’t just look at savings and credit card debt, or a monthly payment, they make the key decision to save as quickly as possible.”\nThe Tip: Do It Yourself. Seriously. Quick: Read Two (or All) Ways To Make Money Off Your Debt\nAnd this tip from author Marcus Evans will get you started. “Just learn that you can actually make money,” he said. “Then make a lot of money.”\n']"
67,How to Watch VR,"['Starting this summer, all 3 million VR headsets will be available. This year’s headsets are expensive and some are even locked down for near the end of the year, but because they give you access to the whole world, there are so many choices you can be active without losing out on cost, though. So to see how you can attend some of the best VR experiences in the world with your smartphone — like those many alternatives have.\nHere are five things you should know about those VR headsets and Oculus Rift for the first time.\n1. Unlike standard VR headsets, the Oculus Rift and Rift Pro have only apps. You can search, play, unlock, support GPS and control the camera, navigate menus, ask questions, create faces and much more.\nVideo apps allow you to choose from more than just the apps you want to use, however.\nThey have, thanks to 3D Handheld, a pair of AR glasses and a built-in headset that allows the phones to feel the virtual reality of their iPhones or Apple’s iPad. They have pre-loaded Vive 4K and Logitech’s Virtual Headset that also works with standard Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive.\nAs with VR apps, only this prototype headset is built around the final high-end version of the Oculus Rift, the faster version. Oculus’ own hackable Vive is about the same size and cheaper than other headsets but adds motion control and drag-and-drop support. This makes this immersive experience much more accessible to more people.\nTo use this model, try no sleep mode with an on-board smartphone, and if using the HTC Vive via a standalone VR headset, you’ll get the ability to watch your augmented reality experiences, enjoy some games, build your own virtual reality pad and have a few small games, download some games and then move on to the next one.\n2. You’ll need to have a VR headset to make Oculus Rift VR compatible. Oculus, like many competitors like Samsung and HTC, made their headsets available with virtual reality apps with Oculus Rift.\nOn the Oculus Rift’s website, you can see that you can use Oculus Rift in conjunction with apps for more than two million VR headsets. For those that only work with VR, please post your VR experience to your Facebook account, or follow Oculus or Facebook into the Oculus app stores.\nMore importantly, if you need a VR headset that you can control from your phone, Oculus Rift is you. Thanks to its shiny new build, Oculus Rift VR requires only a few apps, has 50,000 titles and downloads and has the ability to use in-game co-op for free.\n3. You can set up your own VR experience. You can use a tablet that you choose to keep held up, tablet or camera. You can set up a showroom setup, photograph with your self, store your files and organize your characters. The goal is to you: create your own unique VR experience. At this point, you can’t tell how far you want to go.\nSpecial instructions are posted on Oculus’ website for telling some of the key questions you should pose before engaging with Oculus Rift VR. For example, if you don’t want to see your character appear on screen and then you’re unsure of which mode to explore, set up your own Oculus Rift VR experience and quickly. At this point, you will find it easy to experience Oculus Rift VR content, as well as the virtual world.\n4. You’ll need a headset which can support 3D Printing. Like the iPhone 7, the 3D Printing app Apple produces is based on current technology but includes such things as 3D printers and virtual reality headsets. With the 3D printers, you don’t have to worry about labor and design fees or product costs.\nLook at this example of how to build your own virtual reality experience that comes with Oculus Rift.\nImage Credit: vosdra/ Shutterstock/blunda\n5. You can trade in your Rift and Rift Pro for a wider array of VR headsets. Oculus Rift-based virtual reality headsets are limited to one type of VR experience. You can choose to sit under the Oculus app and build your own VR experience.\nYou can also spend more time with your Rift Pro or Rift Pro Pro directly off the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. You can just enjoy watching your VR experiences now. Don’t ask where VR technology is headed. Either way, there is the option for buying VR headsets just in time for your next ride in the park.\n']"
68,Beyond Earth: A VR experience,"['I arrived at the AMAT @TempleWood – when they put so much work behind it – it was like a trailer on a trailer’s set. Get off the set and get down in the Ramblas, yell some music in front of yourself. Wake up with the first pitch of a game. Don’t talk to other people… watch it, don’t talk to people….watch it. Do this for two minutes. You’ll understand your gear. Buy your gear. Create your own virtual reality experience. It will change you forever! Of course, there’s a lot of work involved – creating the terrain, manufacturing the environment and making all that stuff go down. But if you do enough, you’ll do something utterly amazing.\nWhy is it so cool to play VR? It brings content to life, uses great imagery and acts as a creative challenge of a novel. Beyond Earth is in many ways the perfect combination. Virtually every character in this experience belongs to an impressive cast of unique individuals. They are incredibly adept at VR in an immersive way – from human actors to VR acrobats, med school students, scientists, virtual jewelry designers, animators, U.S. animation and more. There’s something to be said for an exceptionally creative team.\nYou can play through to be that annoying viewer, or at least briefly, there. There are a number of ways you can do this:\nUpload a video for the pic. Get some fuzzy art as well, so you could make a segment of the space station, lit up (if you are capable)… open up a beautiful virtual reality module (to inspire you to get out)\nUpload a spot to make your own real-world landing spot for a VR show (just make sure it’s real enough so you can run to it. For the site, mention “Enduring”. If you are in Europe, read on.\nEnjoy the cut-outs and extras, but in a virtual reality sense, you’ll get multiple options:\nVR School for a VR Professional – develop/produce still videos/logs\nVR School for a VR Designer – craft, design, landscape design, all VR-related video\nSupport Crew – Community, NGO, Arsonists, the former foster kid\nIf you have more (if you are interested in VR) and have seen them, please send a photo or email me at stevesteinmanin@cnn.com\n']"

Although complete with a guide for tourist satisfaction, the soelden approach also offers some basic pleasures: The cobblestone streets and sheer white slopes above make for a wonderfully broad and warm environment.\nAll the same, there is a strict ban on those with short hair and mountain bike rides: Those who remain will be cited for being unable to ride without makeup. They will be fined or even imprisoned for a year or two if they do not travel within the shortest day of the week.\nAlthough the approach to the Soelden is very leisurely, it is very quiet.

73,Fly in a WWI fighter plane,"['Recently I retired a massive U.S. Sauer-Porsche A320 that lived up to its name. The crash of the A318 from the Detroit Air Show two weeks ago raised concerns of possible damage to the engines and mechanics.\nAs I spoke, the lines of blades around the windshield of the flight deck flew in and out like phantoms, with a trailer full of hair! It was done to perfection.\nThere was no one on the ground, in the planes, of any perceived damage to Boeing’s planes.\nThis story is not unique. Civil aviation is a nationwide phenomenon and our military is an integral part of that. But even amid the world’s changing interest in aviation I think there’s just one person in the world who’s thinking about aviation and who gets their head around this issue.\nAir Commodore Percy Goodwin has always been interested in the flying public. And he certainly feels our military. But unlike in many other professions, he’s spent most of his adult life not involved in the industry or volunteering to give back. So in the last few years, he’s been working to raise funds to try to place the future of aviation closer to his heart.\nOne goal is to hopefully make the A318 stand out again. There were several people on the ground Sunday evening who knew the iconic plane, and were mystified by the mystery about the crash.\nGoodwin quickly came up with a $1 million project to raise funds for the plane, like one they had been planning for a long time. Another project: a fly it off the plane again at the Detroit air show.\nHe’s not alone. Doug Wilson of the National People’s Congress, the country’s largest opposition group, tweeted that the A318 “stands up to the very nature of evil,” and that as many as 350 fighters could be killed if their engine dies.\nGoodwin and others are working to find and save parts of aircraft like the A318. Ground support and ground division are also working hard. His ultimate goal is to make the plane as recognizable as the American one it belonged to.\nAs a country, we’re great consumers of air travel.\n']"
74,Ride along with the Hogwarts Express,"['(CNN) — Get ready for some spring and there are days when a little teenage angst could be your only problem. Many summers don’t exactly invite fun. Imagine overnight world travel with smartphones and the discovery of the catapults that guides your door each time a friend exits the home. Such adventure is not an excuse for idleness. Parents should work themselves up to the older years. And, great wisdom says, there are too many great things to mention just to go here and don’t remember to arrive at your house late at night or drop you off after a long night, wish you had your car when it came time to go home and bring your family to the hospital and get you some hot drinks.\nNowadays, when parents think about their kids’ safety, all they think about is that they will end up with the hardest roads: there will be good friends and a family to share the bar with and their cars. They will want to cross the paths of you and this world is ours as our children.\nAnd, it’s not all fun and games. Most teenagers are more comfortable in the house with the two-way radios in their rearview mirror. These are the features that parents are looking for. They are not missing any of the nice kid-to-be destinations we have used for years to explore. These days we are still able to indulge our family’s thrill, but at a much slower pace.\nChildren should develop lifelong gratitude, compassion and purpose. Parents need to encourage children to be thankful for their parents. “I think it’s really hard to be thankful for children and look back on that period of their lives and remember their failures,” said Good Advice Marketing Manager Rob Christensen. “That’s when we can help children start really thanking and respecting the people that are around them.”\nParents have a way to remember us by remembering what we truly are in a nutshell. Instead of judging us for our failures and regrets, remind us of our qualities and engage us in new feelings about life.”\nWatch what life is really like now and what makes you even more hopeful and hopeful to succeed. Continue with the experience and you will have a more balanced view of life’s possibilities. You will have a better appreciation for the triumphs of every situation. You will, therefore, be seen as more satisfied with your family. And if you have such great children you will not have to worry about the cars.\nThe environment in which we live has been altered every few years or years, but it has never changed the meaning of life. Our children will always be here and the expectations remain high. They don’t need us to do those things they don’t have the pleasure of, but they need to do the things we ask them to do to keep the success we have here from happening. We need them to live by the standards that are in place for them today. What are our expectations today? Where are they headed for? And how do we and our children hope to attain those ideals and demonstrate them? And how do we reconcile those realities with these bigger, more real-world expectations?\n']"

It had total assets of Rs 1,028.4 crore ($193 million) at the end of March.\nThe bank has also said that it has paid all the post-tax provision expenses of Rs 532 crore.\nThe most recent U.S. loss estimate put its combined capital at around Rs 11,600 crore ($412 million).\nThe bank suffered its worst ever quarterly financial losses last year, at Rs 9,570 crore, largely due to impairment losses in its property business. Its credit ratings are now of negligible importance in India, where the lender struggled to improve its financial position.\nAmid this shortfall, Indian regulators have put together an emergency capital package.\nSBI CEO K. N. Bhargava said in a statement Friday that the bank also decided to put a resolution fund of Rs 3,000 crore into the bank\'s capital, with the rupee expected to strengthen above 66 US cents to effectively restore access to banking.\nSpeaking at a press conference on Friday, Bhargava said, ""We have given all necessary permissions to complete the evaluation in due course to ensure that we can move forward with the capital raising"".\nThe bank also confirmed its first-quarter net profit, which rose almost 50% to Rs 1,015 crore ($170 million) while revenue grew nearly 30%.\nKrishna Mehta, chief executive of the bank, said, ""We have responded with strong financial performance while adjusting our capital structure to meet our long-term growth objectives.""\nHis company reported an operating profit of Rs 1,135 crore ($102 million) for the first quarter, up 63% from a year earlier.\nBharti also has a large user base outside the subcontinent.\n""India is our fourth biggest market and, at the end of March 2017, total international assets of Rs 9,600 crore (current) and Rs 1,027 crore (current) were registered on our parent\'s books, as compared to Rs 8,335 crore in 2014,"" Bhargava said.\nConsequently, the bank has consolidated some 670 branches across the country, covering 12 markets, with combined customers reaching about 5.2 million.\n']"
77,India's top court strikes down ban on cryptocurrency trading,"['NEW DELHI (CNNMoney) — The Supreme Court’s decision to relax limits on cryptocurrency trading during the year 2017 has paved the way for the latest variant of his crypto, the Digital Currency Market Association (DLMA), to debut in the country.\nThe apex court’s decision, which was implemented on 25 January 2018, was expected to increase the blockage of several cryptocurrency exchanges, run by operators of the global cryptocurrency markets.\nThe Administrative and Tax-Adjudication Committee’s (AAPCC) tentative target for continuing blockage is worth Rs 600 crore. It must be implemented within 11 months, or until lawmakers raise the quantum.\nMore than one billion coins, valued at about US$87 trillion (around Rs 3.83 trillion), have been blockaged since 2016. In that year, 126,400 coins blocked by blockages numbered 5,246.\nIn late 2017, the central bank set a limit of 200,000 shares of the non-listed cryptocurrency Mint. Having been blocked by the AAPCC, Dotcoin was purchased by the government.\nThe battle over tokens like cryptocoin coins from India was complicated by the commissioning of Dvapap Yojana (DudePac), a scheme by the Indian Securities Exchange (ESEX). Market participants received 5 million shares of the crypto.\nBut the Supreme Court, in its 2016 ruling on the third phase of the DudePac scheme, urged the Etoons to drop its non-commissioneded target of 2 billion coins.\nBut seven-judge bench of justices N.R. Sathasivam and A.S. Pai declined that part of the appeal.\nIn January, the AapCC chief Mukul said the ban was likely to spur more customers to try to get into digital coins. Blockchain scholars fear the trend has come to India’s fore.\n“The outcome of the AAPCC meeting meeting will provide guidance for market structure and for other areas of demand like price stability,” said A P Srivastava, founder of Darktrace.\nThe Delhi Centre for Science and Environment had proposed a ban on the weeklong DDB auction. The government approached the Dye Association but the association was silent on the matter.\nMukul and S.V. Singh, principal secretary of the National Commission for Promotion of Science and Technology, have since returned the advisory to the apex court. The agency has initiated legal action on the matter.\nThe high court is currently conducting a hearing on the Delhi Commission for Promotion of Science and Technology’s petition. It has asked BCCL to file an application before it on the ban.\nAAPCC could also modify the suspension of all certificates issued by the exchanges for the week long DDB auction. The agency had said that any eligible certificate of traders could be withdrawn and replaced with a new certificate issued by an alternate entity or a third party to invest in infrastructure projects.\nIndia is only the eighth country in the world to invest in infrastructure for a continuous investment of more than $ 1 trillion, according to the investment management company Bain & Co.\nLast month, Dye Association had filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the decision. The Delhi Centre for Science and Environment argued in the petition that demonetisation violated the free movement of goods and services, which has helped the value of unlisted currencies with relative ease.\nBy Taiga Uranaka and Donna Lamsie\n']"
78,Apple is finally opening its first store in India next year,"['(CNN) — Apple has opened its first store in India in July.\nThe global company was seen at a press event in India on Monday morning to introduce the Mobile Service Centre at Sanjay Nagar in Sanjay Nagar. The store, Apple estimated, is likely to be open for up to a month. It will be the first New Delhi store for the Cupertino-based company.\nApple is also planning on opening another Apple store in Bangladesh and moving its online stores to Bajaj Mall in Bengaluru next year, respectively.\n“This is absolutely a game changer and a brilliant step forward for India,” said Francis Tyre, senior vice president of product management at Apple, in a statement.\nHowever, things are about to get a lot more complicated for India’s Asian manufacturing giants that last year racked up nearly a billion dollars in Chinese theft charges, including Apple. The country, which accounted for 8.5% of Apple’s global market in 2017, will lack a widely recognizable manufacturing sector due to being Asian-dominated.\n“India will change that in the next quarter and it will become a very important region for Apple. It will enable them to focus on acquiring top quality, rather than competing against their competitors,” said Adam Semple, head of the manufacturing business at Markit, an automotive software services provider in London.\nConsumers could make better decisions about purchasing Apple devices if they knew just where they were going to be manufactured rather than where they were going. Other factors that affect price range and demand in India are India’s government taxes, a large number of low-skilled jobs, and no tax on the sale of gadgets abroad.\n“Long-term, if it goes well there will be a substantial increase in volume of net devices. But the economy will not have a quality life any more as fast as it used to,” said Nicholas Considine, a partner at the London-based Fast Company.\nApple is battling to reinvent itself. The tech giant has carved a home for itself in fashion. But Apple has been plagued by accusations that it owes customers money after claims of iCloud blackmail.\nDuring the 2016 launch of the iPhone 6 Plus, the tech giant did not disclose the millionth phone sold in the United States. To date, Apple has sold more than one million iPhones in the United States and has had a 17% year-over-year rise in quarterly revenues.\n']"
79,How India's Silicon Valley is using tech to tackle traffic,"['(CNN) — Walk to Silicon Valley and you’ll be faced with two unwelcome reminders.\nOne is the fact that black cars (a once fashionable industry, and then, no longer!) have been banned from the city limits in the past, slamming women and blocking its burgeoning nightlife and conference spaces.\nThe other is that tech is selling out. And whether you’re first-time users of the new AI or part of the tech-run economy, the city is setting a precedent in the effort to overhaul how cars are sold, driverless taxis banned and ultimately, social media-fueled traffic jams.\nIndia is cashing in on the tech bonanza.\nAbout 150 companies are building out their vehicles in the city. Uber, Google, and an array of other startups have been investing in public transportation systems in India, starting with an Aug. 15 investment deal with W.E. du Pont de Nemours and Co.\nSEE ALSO: Faces of Africa\'s $1.4B trade mission\n“We are the first among the cities in India to have a fleet of autonomous taxis built and operating on public roads,” said Chris T. Diamantchhi, vice president of government affairs at Uber, in a video released earlier this year, describing a workforce of more than 10,000. “Drivers and passengers alike are being expected to register with our network, and be able to drive around every corner until we stop.”\nA decision on whether to open a public system to drive has been pending since 2016, when the Supreme Court on March 7, 2018, ruled against a request to ban all vehicles from “public” roads. While the law went into effect on June 30, months later, the country has yet to roll out its own system.\nIn 2017, India\'s Ministry of Road Transport & Highways announced that it would not only issue a ban on all Uber and Kazeem rides on the city\'s roads, but it would also shutter additional service based on driving standards.\n“In keeping with the people\'s expectations, the Minister convened a meeting in the capital city of New Delhi — the capital of India — during which she raised the issue of the taxi fleet, and the pace at which it is being built and the connectivity issues being faced with such large volumes of traffic,” an IndiGo spokesman said in an email to CNN.\nUber and other companies have also said they would first show a public approval (or ""public disapproval"") and then come up with an easy-to-understand, quick-launch system for determining the vehicles\' availability at points of traffic.\nPrakash Shelar, a professor at New Delhi’s Vasant Kunj University, said companies should explore the tech enough to make it easier for other users to acquire the vehicles to operate in more public use.\n“We have a momentum in India. We have started-up on the line about sort of creating roads as a result of automation in technology,” he said. “We could go back and do it very easily and do it on existing roads, as we have done now in India, let\'s spend some time planning for that. It is completely possible for companies to do that.”\nSwahili. Pest. Pixel. Surface. Uniform. Pear-and-shimmy. All the dozens of different slogans that go with everything else in India, the position of cars has gotten increasingly urbanized. Think of it as Silicon Valley circa 1987.\nTech savvy. A cornucopia of social, political, and cultural concerns. Real gold.\n“But what is the ideal version of an e-bike? The truly astonishing part is that the national e-bike company Verisign already has launched a service to buy a bike. And there is already a roll-out program in Maharashtra,” said Surya Kunvekar, principal engineer at Verisign India.\nStill, Kunvekar said there is “great potential” for India’s e-bike revolution, and unless the roads are fixed within the next four years, ride-sharing businesses like Verisign are expected to have plateaued and not grow like other traditional transport modes.\n“The transportation industry, like any other industry, needs to evolve to be globally competitive,” Kunvekar added. “We cannot let India become a national destination like China or Japan. We need to take a bold first step.”\n']"

83,Trump stumbles in first efforts to control virus response as fear spreads and markets fall,"['President Donald Trump appeared to be aware of some of the worst effects of the Zika virus on Sunday, or at least thinking about it, on Twitter, according to people familiar with the social media activity.\nIn early April, a report claiming the Zika virus has spread in the Americas caused alarm and sparked a massive spike in U.S. heat, strokes and blood testing, an increase in illnesses, and concern that people were being infected at an accelerated pace.\nThe Trump administration followed up on the headlines.\nLast week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control announced it was testing infected mosquitoes in 59 states. There is no vaccine and funding for the Zika virus is expected to run out within days. So far, scientists say there is no evidence that Zika will cause diseases such as severe birth defects or birth defects linked to the birth defect microcephaly.\n“The message from all of us is Trump is going to be much less of a master planner for what’s going to happen,” said Michael Avenatti, the attorney who represents Attainables, a campaign group against President Donald Trump that calls itself “disingenuous and deceptive.”\nCoupled with Trump’s health trip to Davos in January, Trump’s normally upbeat stance on immigration was suddenly less palatable.\nHis campaign suggested on Monday that his likely policy agenda would consist of a nearly $1 trillion spending bill before he leaves office next week, not addressing the Zika virus until the first part of July.\nWhether or not the administration can follow through on that deadline and add a concrete commitment to eradicating Zika, some in the Republican party are becoming pessimistic about the U.S. ability to deal with the virus and grow its appeal to some voters concerned about safety.\nSome Republicans — both Democrats and independents — said it was time for Trump to step aside and focus on his health. While Democrats said Trump could step down to allow congressional Republicans to pass immigration legislation, others declared that if he did not at least do so, it would be impossible to deal with Zika.\n“The President said he’s decided to do something about Zika — he said that, he said that, he said that, and he said that,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has criticized Trump for taking a softer line on the issue.\nMany Republicans agree with Graham on the need to deal with the virus, but they said Trump’s largely out-of-the-mainstream presidency has raised concerns, given his public expressions of concerns and his efforts to use legislative language to compromise with Democrats.\nThe group that brought pressure on Trump earlier this year for a crackdown on Democrats’ treatment of abortion in the United States said Sunday that Trump has become increasingly dangerous.\n“The President has spoken volumes about how his political positions have become increasingly dangerous,” said John Jones, a spokesman for Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, who urged Trump to “commend the courageous young women of South Carolina who are suffering after a cardiac arrest and are being rushed to hospitals in Florida and Indiana.”\nJones added that Trump is “about to see what he can do to finally restore some of the health in women’s health and restore the health in America.”\n']"

That\'s why you will miss it.\nSince it came to the internet with its souped-up market, social networks are far less attractive to individual customers who don\'t realize that your organization and your target market change constantly, making it even harder to succeed in their new world of online communities.\nAt the most, the good friendliness and ephemerality of social networks is very much lost. Yet the signs are that anyone who pays attention to social networks now, through the desktop and the mobile, will suddenly see the light.\nBut first, keep an eye on Google and Twitter to see how they compare with the web.

92,Why India's citizenship law crosses the line,"['By T & s\nWhen it comes to changing our citizenship rules, India has some dodgy rules for newcomers and citizens: There\'s a clause in Indian citizenship that you can\'t ask anyone to ""submit proof"" of your Indian citizenship to the government. That doesn\'t necessarily mean you must ""submit proof"" to go back to India.\nFor instance, people wanting to become citizens can wear a simplified Indian national identity card and qualify to be a citizen after passing a simple physical test that requires them to show proof of their Indian citizenship in the first four years of their citizenship.\nOn the other hand, some Indians who want to become citizens can\'t. And for those of us who wish to become citizens, the process can be intimidating.\nThe issue of Indians acquiring citizenship in India has been repeatedly raised since the country\'s last prime minister, Indira Gandhi, took office in 2002. While most of those members of her family were Indian of the Indian Gauravkhan-type people, a few, like Rajyavadi Mulikarthi, still hold their country\'s native amity and love of India and much of their soft power in the country.\nI\'m not really sure why that has become so popular and popular with Indians. But, perhaps it is because of the global power of India\'s 2020 election, which may surprise many Indian Indian-Americans.\nAfter we first heard about the Narendra Modi government\'s Citizenship and Residency Bill, which came to India in 2017, many people tried to play on that connection to the various nationalist parties. Once they heard about my intention to become a citizen as they are then, I tried to explain that my desire to become a citizen was also to avoid unfairness for different groups.\nThough most people wouldn\'t feel confident about committing to being a citizen in the country that they are currently in, they were able to learn to argue they were not a citizen. For instance, some students and teachers who own business establishments were able to explain that they were not as a citizen as they first thought they were. And for the common folk, nobody knows the difference between them and foreigners or different kinds of Indians.\nBut, I fear, it is not that simple. Newer citizens are often very sneaky when it comes to hidden administrative efforts, hidden motivations and hidden biases against Indian people, including allegations that they are not Indians.\nAs the problems in the Indian right become more visible, creating more awareness among Indians around possible citizenship choices, I think this would be a good step in recognizing that some Indians prefer not to become citizens because they don\'t have any guarantee of a comfortable life after moving to India in the first place. But, they\'re still reluctant to do so, wary of the possibility of easier and more difficult employment opportunities in India and the region.\nWhen I say I fear for the Indian right, that\'s because I don\'t have any sort of guarantee to not be a citizen if I don\'t want to live in India. It\'s because I can\'t deny that people who have remained in India for so long are in a class of their own, without any guarantees and fears.\n']"

Symptoms of a coronavirus infection can range from diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, trouble breathing and diarrhoea, to flu-like symptoms that include feeling fever and backache.\nWhile some of the symptoms might seem like typical symptoms, it is in fact a sign of a coronavirus infection.\n“If you get six, seven, eight weeks of diarrhea, you might get six, seven, eight weeks, that doesn’t include the humilogue diarrhea,” said Dr. Lesa Masley, co-director of endocrine and infectious diseases at New York’s CHDH (World Health Organization) New York.\nUnless there’s a foodborne illness that you’re unaware of, it’s OK to avoid contact with people caught by the Health Department or the person who went to a hospital.\n“This is a devastating disease,” Masley said. “It affects everybody from newborns, college students, 25-year-olds up to young children.

The official had booked a plane to America without the country’s National Health and Medical Research Council, warning the nuclear agency that her husband’s response to Trump’s tweets suggesting a fast and vaccine was in the works would have riled the public.\nHeather Hintz, a spokeswoman for NMC, told CNN the cancer center announced its patient’s results Monday.

101,Will warmer weather help fight the coronavirus? Singapore and Australia suggest maybe not,"['(CNN) — Singapore and Australia are among the eight most dangerous countries in the world. The other two are protected by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) until May 1.\nBut experts say strong regional weather across Australia, South Asia and the Northern Hemisphere — effects of global warming in common areas in which the feasting may actually be occurring — might help fight the virus.\nThe the part of the coronavirus that causes the virus underlies Singapore and Australia were given the coldest-ever temperature in an international survey of beach thermometers in Asia.\n“The temperature at the Pacific Ocean was quite below the long-term average of Australian to Asia temperatures — close to minus 13,” said Alcon Ltd.’s chief operating officer, Alvin Lesher. “This translated directly into the virus reaching the Australian mainland.”\nFor reasons still unknown, a total of 9,000 objects in a sample (two objects, a paddle and a variety of things) were tested in the same humidity area around California Beach in California.\nMost of the objects were made of solid gold, although the results were startling: the small particles were 7/10 inch in diameter.\n“For example, if your gills turn purple, you could see the small bits of sugar in the salt in your bloodstream,” added Lesher.\n“These kind of pieces make your throat boil. This might mean the virus takes root,” he said.\nThe Australian model is extremely conservative, and with no explanation why so much of the test results weren’t from the ocean near California Beach.\nIt’s possible that the scientists aren’t familiar with the value of the ultraviolet radiation that makes the glittering dust at the beach far hotter.\nOne possibility is that the pockets of air trapped in the virus do not move through open up areas on wind farms, Dr. Perry Carrington of the Australian Department of Health told CNN’s Stephanie Fazio.\n“That would be counter-intuitive,” she said. “Some areas are closed off, but it would be the air.”\nThe same is true in the Northern Hemisphere, where Australian skin cancers have been detected in “a tiny minority” of people, she said.\nThe presence of the virus might be part of a global pattern of mistongering in the environment, and not of a regional one, Dr. Matthew Back would argue.\n“The environmental chain is a petri dish,” he said. “A tiny bit of moisture can make a global phenomenon: that it swims down from the surface of the ocean.”\n“Once the sun passes through, the bacteria are instantly browned,” he added. “Then over time they flip into less sickness-like forms, like some kind of whirlwind.”\nHe said the temperature in a thermal analysis of participants in an IARC Indicator Project — which is which location the E. coli virus typically infects most — found that a presence of the virus over time caused it to travel fast and sweep out many people.\nThe Aussie survey was conducted over the past seven years, followed by the Indicator Project study. IARC scientists found that the increase in recent years was mostly due to the structural changes and changes in protective factors related to the thermal changes.\nFurther research has yielded positive results. In an inaugural study into the risk factors for illness in Australia in 2009, Australia’s Agriculture Ministry carried out a survey of 42,000 Australians.\nThe survey conducted by Australia’s Department of Agriculture and Food found that the risk factors for illness were not high among those near a far-flung edge in Australia. In comparison, more than 50% of Australians made the same lifestyle choice.\n']"

Six people in Wyoming tested positive for the virus, while in Idaho, the virus for which it is known to spread via direct contact, instead led to seven deaths.\nAnother scientist cited in a recent AP story confirmed the findings of the AP’s research, while another scientific expert agreed that researchers are “on the right track,” and that the viruses are close.\nNoonan said that while that study was not yet complete, the team did find unusual cases of illness, such as a certain type of respiratory disease, that warrants further examination.\n“How many cases have we identified so far suggests that scientists are still waiting for something substantial, like a conclusive recommendation from a new internal study,” Noonan said.\n“If they’re helpful in studying this, then we’ll do that,” Noonan said.\nMore about all the news from the disease:\n']"

An initial number of residents fled their homes had not been confirmed, said bureau spokeswoman Katie Bull.\nAuthorities would not elaborate on where the fires were located and declined further comment.\nThe last large northern monsoon season, 2016-17, was hit by two major fires in southeastern Australia, including the Oakley fire, which burned for more than two weeks to near-surface land.\nThe last major blaze, which covered 2,450 acres (1,651 hectares) and destroyed 2,502 structures, was managed in December by a massive coal haulage operation dubbed TRV.\nTwo quarters of Australia’s population — 1.3 million people — is currently vulnerable to extinction, according to statistics provided by the Australian Conservation Foundation.\nElephant numbers have slumped by more than 70 per cent in Australia’s northern states in the past decade, as authorities seek to protect some of the country’s large wild animals from extinction.\nFor bird species, habitat loss, flooding and fire are among the threats posed by catastrophic fires, weather patterns and human disturbance, BOM said.\n“The biggest threat to the population of endangered Aussie wildlife, particularly Australian kangaroos and more important endangered mussel species, is the Shellparishan thekkn that would face significant extinction in the nation’s golden wetlands if continued as threatened,” a BOM statement said.\nThe agency said the Lindybosuk sheep caribou breed will be the next most threatened animal on the planet.

There are 170 million Albinism people in Australia, of which about 60% are blacklisted. The trouble is, there are many other identities of albinism and bushfire weather patterns that can be affected.\nThe problem with reporting, the researchers wrote, is it could be inferred that the issue has not been read as relatively problem-free or “that in fact this has been part of the country’s environmental risks over the past decade or so.” They also confirmed that the sooner the figures are published the better.\nThe researchers speculated that the larger impacts of albinism were at least partially due to drought, and social stigma. Blocking albinism from mainstream Western knowledge is understood as a social stigma, especially among men, an issue that scientists now do not recognize as widespread. The problem of experiencing a person’s beard or a bath must also be clearly documented to make it a natural stressor.\nOne very powerful example of how climate change affects mental health from a cat-like perspective was reported this month by Melbourne psychiatrist George Magrino, who writes in the Daily Telegraph:\nThe enormous growth of albinism has been so sudden in Malawi, Zimbabwe and Australia that local albinism clusters have swelled to thousands, sometimes into central cities.\n']"

""One may wonder if this could turn out to be a bactericide, that’s easy to mistake.""\nStudies don\'t exist yet to link contaminated lobsters with host disease, but parts of their body do appear to harbor multiple immune toxins that can cause other infections, including gonorrhea, H1N1 and Crohn\'s disease, health officials warn.\nSouth Korean scientists say they\'ve found a strain of the bacteria they use as an influenza vector and are investigating it to see if other bacteria are responsible for contamination.\nIt could lead to diseases caused by pathogens that go through various stages of distribution and where particles do not have any active interaction with host cells, and result in foodborne germs, according to the Nature Journal\'s chart below.\nArmed with data from about 2,100 lobsters that survived at least a decade in North Korea and previously unknown locations in South Korea, researchers say they\'ve detected a large percentage of the plonic immune system. The presence of any new strain could raise concerns about a risk of serious disease outbreaks, although there\'s no evidence of the disease being transmitted from land to home.\n""We would like to see more data available,"" said Dr. Fred Flanagan, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.\nFlanagan said the transmission risks for plonic immunity in the transplant population vary, with no clear connection between proteins used in plonic immunity, but proteins made by those affected by the infection are particularly susceptible to the plonic immune system.\nThe presence of some genes linked to plonic immunity would provide further information about the novel interaction between proteins, and could lead to a more coordinated response, he said.\nIn Haiti, victims of an apparently natural host disease—Chronic Acute Acute Crohn\'s Disease—are suffering from viral diarrhea in the same way as counterparts, because their immune systems are still different than those produced in land to new sites in the developing world, Blatz said.\nThe bacteria in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, may have almost fully vaccinated the rare microbe, he said.\n""It could be the first time in a century that there is a disease outbreak in [the outbreak area], and we wouldn\'t know how to prevent it,"" he said.\nRecent genetic studies have shown the bacterium in fruit flies, which are members of the Plonic Immunodeficiency virus (POIN), to be in close proximity to their host cells.\nWhile plonic Immunity in patients is more limited than for modern patients, the study suggests it could be able to target cells that assemble fragments of the fruit fly. This will allow researchers to potentially identify early stage cases and shut down the viral epidemic.\nScientists are especially concerned by the phenomenon of plonic and cyber disease clusters—they are responsible for leaving bacteria in the cells to incubate in a pre-existing environment.\n""It’s important to understand that the burden of Plonic immunity is so low that it impacts other immune systems, and would be able to control bacterial spread,"" Blatz said.\n']"

117,How tattoos became fashionable in Victorian England,"['Direction in art.\nTelegraph UK\nCut-outs made for very long versions in Victorian London and considered elegant and fitting for a friend or partner’s birthday party, could also go into the better-looking modern era, according to art historian and The History of Geography author Brooke Carey.\nWhile most women still wear chairs with air-cutters placed on the front, they were often known as “dolls,” which was derisively presented as a symbol of noble maternal loyalty, in later days of the Victorian era. It was also once considered a feminine element among a tarty woman, having crossed over into considered megalomaniacal fashions.\nAnd who says someone could be leading an austere life without even knowing about a necklaces? The iconic Italian corkie was first worn by Mary Wollstonecraft, and which became part of Florence’s Donatella Versace collection, says Carey, who is known for her frankness in her depictions of Victorian women – from bikini-clad models to transvestites and beards.\nThe late Victorian nastiness was not as mild as today’s 20th century: It was rooted in the powerful divide between servants and intellectuals.\n“Modern women are more expressive, a touch like little angels on a curved platform,” says Carey. “They still do usually eschew the veil as part of a circle of aggressive bravado. But these ladies don’t need it to get ahead.”\nClassic chivalry-style hairstyles, such as one borrowed from Mary Ann’s became famous for its ability to convey calmness, such as when one of the models in Marlene Dietrich’s “The West Wing” flashed a giggle before the camera, at an idealistic audience.\nIt was considered to be more sophisticated than its eastern contemporaries, or the anglicized carving style of Hitchcock.\nStephanie Elizabeth, known for being a firm believer in the First Amendment, opted to go in public for first-class functions like gatherings and after parties by the movies for which she worked. The trend meant being more discreet than many other female todays, she says, but all in all, the glint of leather stole most glamour away from close-up mirrors.\nIn the same way, today’s cursive pens were widely used in the English art world as expressions of mourning, and when Elliott Heller, a graduate student at the National Gallery in London, opened the doors to his studio in 1918 they showed every admirer exactly what they looked like.\nHeller later sold books about it, and began experimenting with ink made from concrete blocks.\nHe experimented with tracing by painting elaborate circles of paper onto surrounding surfaces to evoke images of marble, but the idea of creating a jewel-like golden wing-like ornament upon a cold floor to help the viewer visualize the figure seemed over the top.\nThere were even hints of jubilation, as anxious Britain’s most famous poet wrote a poem for Prince Charles when he was the king’s biographer. While most children of the wealthy clung to their lithe aristocratic look, “they admired a Little Europe, dressed in the finest trenches and trenches and trenches… But they thought they could get a glimpse of Europe’s lastest landscape on view… Eventually they learned what it looked like when the King took the throne.”\nWhen freed from the Ingersoll organization in Oxfordshire, Cookers Elizabeth’s Prince Henry wrote to King Henry VIII: “Now he is calling you King Henry… The fact that you had centuries to learn how to read and to make… the imagination of King Henry VII… has become the ambition of an enormous reason and for a natural, black person, British British and America.”\nOther threads from the Wendell Berry collection, which was auctioned by Whistles, led to backlash as retailers saw it as a golden relic. Its owners had been considering selling it to Reginald Lewis, a historian and emeritus professor at University College London, for several years, and later opted to halt it.\n“When Henry saw it, he became profoundly disturbed about it,” says Carey. “As someone who had seen horses traded throughout the 1600s in Pennsylvania, he thought a vase as Vines would make pretty handsome ornamental companions and after a lot of thought turned into an idea. But the fact that it remained there might actually become a symbol of a feeling of personal transformation.”\n']"
118,Tom Blachford's upside-down urban landscapes will make you look twice,"[""My last girlfriend had a garage-eating boyfriend who was obsessed with dirt. When her husband and I discovered that the lot of us in this sunny Connecticut brown corner, our bedroom was three stories deep, our classroom was not far from my townhouse, our village was newly renovated, and I felt tired. Then the three-car garage was dead. I drifted into 'NeverEnding Sustainable Living,' a book that looks at how to dispose of our home's unexpectedly lopsided parcels of land that surround us.\nI might start out with sitting in the garage, with her furniture doing everything to make our home more pleasant, but (for my money) there is nothing quite like how we to avoid and take care of some a childhood houseboat that suddenly slips down a hillside when you fall asleep. I always fly the flag for a deep backyard struggle, trying to escape a carpeted place, but I had always planned to demolish it. Now I have a fix for a down-to-earth unholy backyard struggle that is likely to be more dramatic than most.\nThough Tom and I are two kids from a dysfunctional family, we will be more than happy to share the great outdoors. Getting the first sense of how it gets better for the country depends largely on your ownership of a tree house. To achieve a great outdoors experience, we spend a significant amount of time learning how to walk and look down the hills. Most tree house owners, as evidenced by a few who have successfully found it profitable, will tell you that trees keep rain on plants rather than put a spark in them.\nI like the idea of picking trees for a house down to the ground. But I also like knowing that to actually get inside a tree house you will need to drive across the country and undertake significant strenuous walking. The major reason I don't have one of the following lopsided locations:\n1. Slant winds up on the tree branch behind me\nI will continue to have the inside view of this landscape. But why would I walk cross-country?\n2. And try to have fun outdoors\nI visited the Lower Sepulveda Valley recently, and the blowing wind seemed like such a fun activity for a child. The more I did, the more I learned of the beauty of the landscape. A relative of mine was digging while I tended the ditch and had a picture taken of the region. It is important to get clear trees and plants on each side of a tree house, for all we can see it sounds a beautiful image of the lawn and the rocks in the ditches, but it also adds a lovely reminder of how precious these trees and plants are.\nIf I am going to be able to get inside a tree house to eat plants instead of simply sitting on it, I will be able to appreciate the beauty of the landscape, even if it is just a few inches from my local oak or pine.\n""]"
119,The cities designed to be capitals,"[""Google mapped just four major cities in Eastern Europe this year, said Nathan MacPhail, executive director of the Taskforce Europe on Tomorrow Cities.\nFrom an overview of cities:\nThe cities that proposed this year were Gare du Nord, the Helsinki, Norway and Frankfurt.\nIt will be announced on April 24.\nBelow is a list of the cities chosen.\n1) Gare du Nord, Finland. Could we call Helsinki the biggest city in Europe? Five times bigger than Vienna. In 2002, Helsinki would dominate the world map.\n2) Milan, Italy. For years Milan was often acknowledged as the capital of the postwar European Union but have been transformed into a stalled-out battleground.\n3) Reykjavik, Iceland. For the past two decades Iceland’s recession has forced it to turn inward to minimize it.\n4) Nizhny Novgorod, Czechoslovakia. Its EU-like post-war economy survived then post-communist Russia.\n5) Stockholm, Sweden. A first quarter epitomizes the Nordic economy, with more than 10% unemployment rate and steadily rising inflation.\n6) Hamburg, Germany. Now the city most recognized for the third straight year as a summit destination for the COP23 climate negotiations to be held in Marrakesh, Morocco.\n7) Warsaw, Poland. Made up of all those warm warm Germany, with a city that lost 60% of its output in the Soviet Union.\n8) Vienna, Austria. Perhaps the most celebrated, with a capital city who developed fast.\n9) Moscow, Russia. The city has faced a string of economic crises, many of them since the 1990s.\n10) Osnabrückl, Germany. With a large population of 102 million, it already has a relatively high-tech economy.\n11) Istanbul, Turkey. Open skyscrapers and tented terraces, which topped a 100-story skyscraper in Istanbul's central business district.\n12) Ramsham, India. A historic and complex historic city with 27 million inhabitants.\n13) Copenhagen, Denmark. Who doesn’t want their city center to be a key hub for something called “smart cities?”\n14) Amsterdam, Holland. The Dutch City for 25 years had regional and local economic clusters, while still finding success as an attraction for businesses.\n15) Belmarsh, UK. The fastest growing city in London with a global population of about 40 million.\n16) Kolkata, India. Religiously based in one of the world’s largest cities with more than 1 million people.\n17) Llanos, Greece. The island of Corsica faced an international catastrophe after the 1991 Syrian civil war, but the two nations have never seen their shared weak security fence since.\n18) Kumbh Mela, India. India was ruined by floods and devastation during the war.\n19) Ceuta, Spain. Two of the most popular destinations in the world for tourists.\n20) Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Imagine a magnet, with airports connecting countries.\n21) Copenhagen, Denmark. The city now addresses global crises. The Danish capital is the most expensive city in the world, paying $80 to $110 a square foot per square meter.\n22) Parolees, South Africa. Designed to combat intercommunal violence by providing shelter for the hundreds of thousands of homeless people across the continent.\n23) Nyon, Norway. Conveniently located in Norway. Love ambience, health and wellness and a shopping center.\n24) Toronto, Canada. With the world’s largest population and value of $30 trillion and a harbour for every freight train, it commands the attention of certain international powers.\n25) Vienna, Austria. The city’s current leader, currently relegated to a polling place after bribery allegations related to the negotiations of COP23.\n26) Paris, France. North America’s oldest city is now in great demand as a meeting hub for the world’s rich and developing.\n27) Suzhou, China. The city was “liberated” from regime change in 2007, after 11 days of riots.\n""]"

""Southwest has always been an exemplary student-teacher partnership.""\nHe referenced a statement from the federal U.S. Department of Education, in which it said it is trying to ""level the playing field"" by increasing participation among children and giving parents equal access to appropriate accommodations.\nSouthwest said in a statement that it supports a more equal access policy for students, but ""we recognize that differences in performance will create a complex environment in which we all encounter.""\nSome parents are expecting more in the way of reassurance that the airline will comply with the federal government’s guidelines on seats, while some are concerned that the company has been too aggressive and is letting some kids take the seat.\nBut to do the better job, students from these elementary schools will have to work to establish ties with the airline. It\'s not clear yet whether they can figure out how to fulfill their goals.\nWhich is good.

Tsang said units are being sent to aid the treatment and extraction of the bodies and shields to help the victims recover.\nVolcanoes are the world’s fourth-biggest volcanic force, capable of inundating and damaging entire towns in order to expand and build their capacity, the JAAA said. And unlike gas-spewing, they cause hot, uncontrollable eruptions across its 8,231-square-mile rim — which makes them the world’s highest amount, according to the Institute for Geophysical Research at the University of Warwick in Britain.\n“Each volcano is uniquely powerful for its locations,” Tsang said. “Volcanoes these days occur there only to be fortunate that there are the best of them — as it has been with nearly every other factor,” he said.\nVolcanoes can erupt at any time in a million years, especially in wet climates, the JAAA said. The strongest eruption occurred in Indonesia’s forests in 2003.

A lower court would rule on an appeal, taking precedence over a much longer process.\nMonday, Judge David Offset said Tyler had received no facts proving she was the plaintiff. A three-judge panel overturned her judgment.\nTyler declined to comment beyond her attorney\'s brief.\n“Mr. Tyler has proved his will to take this matter to the point of litigation, and her trial did not take this into account,” said Rusty Hardin, a lawyer for Tyler\'s organization, Last Wish.\nFirm misses out on temporary relief\nTyler remained optimistic of her chances of victory.\n“I\'d ask just to be clear - there is a lot of work to be done, there’s a lot of obstacles in front of us and we’re still hopeful,"" she said.\nBut Tyler, who is now working as a research associate at the University of Michigan, said she was confident she could persuade Judge Offset to allow her to proceed with her claim that she was harmed in the federal court proceedings.\n“I really think this is a bigger case than ever,” she said. “I’m confident we’ll win the case.”\nThe trial in 2016 found Tyler and her attorney, Michelle Carey, liable for paying a $1 million judgment in a wrongful-missgment defense to Backhoe Chemical Corp. that paid her $2.9 million in an involuntary sterilization contract.\nThe judge had previously rejected claims about the size and construction of the implants that she could have been relieved of due to inadequacy, which was the conclusion of the trial.\nHardin had estimated she could get $8.5 million plus legal fees to address the remaining verdict, which he dismissed on Wednesday.\nThe jury found Tyler did not appear to be motivated by a desire to protect her privacy.\nTyler’s family said they believe the verdict is not surprising.\n“Our family is upset that the verdict is held in such low regard by our medical professionals, especially the women who benefit from her surgeries,” their lawyer, Jen Miller, said.\n“These are young women suffering the life-changing injury of living with chemical attack and poverty as a result of their false affirmation,” she said.\nLegal troubles back on store shelves\n“They took advantage of a woman in my mother\'s arms, to put a false instrument in front of the judge and undercut the legitimacy of her case and to be held to a very limited standard that has no merit,” Tyler said.\nTrial attorney Amy Rosenkranz, speaking for Hardy, said Tyler\'s left of $1.3 million in judgment is pending payment.\nHardin could not be reached for comment.\nMore than 30 clinics – including thousands of health centers nationwide – have reported problems with women continuing to have her surgeries after their devices were rejected.\nCongress has made issue of its own. A 2012 law passed by the House of Representatives requires all surgical mesh implants to meet guidelines for coverage and training of emergency care, and the FDA has not asked how many of those implants are not meeting federal guidelines.\nIn response to any increase in the numbers of women seeking mesh implants, several states have passed or expanded their laws. The Oregon Attorney General\'s Office plans to seek state and federal regulatory actions to require such implants.\nIn New Jersey, the state Attorney General’s Office is looking into allegations against a pelvic mesh clinic that had tested female patients and provided them with valuable training.\nProviding training is another issue, just as providing financial support to survivors of breast cancer was a reason many people are in business today.\nDoris Primos, 26, a spokeswoman for the National Congress of American Men Health Care, said the organization met with a representative from the Health Care Access coalition before ruling out further litigation.\n']"

129,Australia's Gladys Liu scandal shows how the Chinese Communist Party is weaponizing race,"['Updated: (April 5, 4:26 p.m.) A local radio host said she was ""about to head to jail for her mob history."" This led to stories about Liu\'s case, and then, many, a competing piece appeared on the NotInTheUS she was arrested last year for charges of bribery. In the aftermath, the Chinese state minister turned down the call to open a human trafficking case against the 36-year-old woman. Now that the report, a snippet of his verified statement, is in, of course, what matters: Liu is calling.\nMining resources have become a proxy battle between China and Europe, fueled in part by an eagerness to expand their haves and have-not lifestyles in the West. Since the global financial crisis began in 2008, the number of mines there has spiked as China\'s production values have skyrocketed. Now the supply side has been hit hard as more resources are rolling out, killing the very companies involved.\nHundreds of miners have died in China and West Africa in the last few years alone. In fact, one Xinhua News Agency journalist recently documented an increase in Chinese deaths based on China\'s carbon dioxide emissions.\nIf Chinese miners can raise consciousness about the illegal activity in which they operate, then the Chinese Communist Party and the Central Military Commission (CMC) in Beijing can wield even greater weapons in a bid to exert an unprecedented influence over South East Asia.\nTechnically speaking, these days Chinese miners are attracted by Beijing\'s power, the preeminence of that spot where some will be involved in an illegal scrap yard or swapping for other recyclables. But for those who take the stage, this type of political power that is rapidly going into affect China\'s critical industry are drawing Chinese miners to a new, more familiar avenue.\nSo far, China\'s producing and exporting of coal to Asia is the hot-potato old frontier. Mine workers from all over the world have been springing to China, hoping to capitalise on the burgeoning market. Ten of the world\'s top ten mines are running out of coal, according to the International Association of Mineworkers (IAUP), with more than 4% of the world\'s overall production currently untaxed.\nIt is a barometer of political power in an increasingly Asian power. Recently, Chinese coal companies joined the global market for the first time in an effort to offset declining coal production from Australia. They bought a share of Australian coal exports for just one cent per ton, which China had required for independence.\nFor a country that had much of its interest in China\'s coal industry from the 1950s onward, this is an alarming development. But at least if Chinese miners can raise their consciousness about the illegal activity they are en route to it, this could lead to a country shift away from the kind of sacred heritage with which traditional politicians like Jingdong Han are struggling to navigate China.\n']"
243,The extinction crisis is far worse than you think,"[""The global glut is now bigger than ever, and the price of oil has collapsed to historic lows. While many countries and businesses continue to be fine, the people around the globe are in deep, deep debt to make ends meet. They've stopped being strong, and now will not be able to stay strong enough to keep up with the demands of an ever-changing world. One simple thing will sink in: we're on a planet that's already in the midst of a catastrophic existential crisis.\nIt's pretty sad. Yet most of us never have even looked at it as such. And we're not alone.\nAs the global downturn intensifies, the number of jobs trapped in low-income countries has grown dramatically. We're not so bad anymore, when you take account of the fact that the world economy is far smaller than that of major developed economies, and about a third of the size of the United States. And by 2020, we're expected to outgrow the United States by two million new jobs. People living in countries with high rates of poverty will feel very strong pain, and massive destruction of their infrastructure, including agriculture.\nThe sheer magnitude of the depletion of these rapidly growing, increasingly unsustainable and bankrupt nations will require an overwhelming level of deep red ink for all the world to process.\nWe need to take action now, because this is no longer a state of war. The rest of us, whether in those increasingly tough economic times, or in various parts of the world that are dealing with extreme, enormous life-threatening problems such as climate change and HIV/AIDS, have put up a valiant front. But we can't let things slide anymore. As the world's population ages, it is increasingly difficult to find human assistance for conditions in which humans have proven to be crucial.\nWhile circumstances around the world are changing fast, we can only get there if human-to-human movements toward adaptation continue.\nThe poor are no longer required to feed themselves in a dirty bowl of rice alone. But they have to eat in a way that brings their food from the depths of poverty — with our natural food-processing machines flooding from the neighboring countries with the right amount of water. Just a few recent examples illustrate this solution.\nAbout a decade ago, Rio de Janeiro launched the world's first bio-fuel-friendly urban mass transit system in one of the world's busiest cities, which boasts seven miles of bus lines and three subway lines that connect to its subway system. It was a remarkable start.\nBut Brazil actually did not keep on the leading edge of the bio-fuels revolution for a generation, which culminated in the demise of the coal-powered Arcore. Many believe this gives Brazil a very different chance to make a quantum leap ahead. But it still lags the world when it comes to developing knowledge and craftsmanship. And, as the Brazilian government is proving every year, the world is turning into an abysmal living laboratory for those who can make the truly slow, tiny steps in the path of progress.\nThat's why we need you. You've given us that help. You've given us a beacon that's right around the corner: one that will know that once the world returns to normal, we can help make this chapter right.\n*This video has been modified to fit an image of\nthe WORLD as a whole.\n""]"
244,'We are failing the elephants',"['The newly-elected U.S. Congress says the United States has a moral obligation to care for the elephant population in Africa. But politicians argue the billions of dollars have been spent promoting their own greed and control of resources.\nEver since the federal government imposed a variety of stringent regulations on Washington\'s influence in shaping international financial and strategic events, its administration seems to be trying to spread its influence to others. The U.S. Bureau of the Environment ended up creating the international trade and investment fund the TPC of the Financial System Management Council. While its sole mission is to help countries develop and develop the trade policies and capabilities to counter illicit financial flows, the TPC is an arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce that helps out big business.\nThe TPC was established in 1987 with the help of Prince George\'s County General Hospital (the charitable trust of Prince George\'s County), and has formed a global network of experts, chaired by David Letterman, who plays host for seven years to debates and international conferences on environment issues.\nOn Saturday, we sat down with Michael Chernus to talk about the TPC and the importance of funding international actors to take on the role of stewards of environmental stewardship in a country.\nMichael Chernus, editor of the Wildlife Magazine, told us we should be ""learning to rely on hard facts instead of rhetoric.""\nAnd then, with a little help from a rambling manifesto called ""Thrift Pre-Sale: Why Greens Should Leverage Deeply About Trade,"" launched by Condé Nast chief-executive Michael Wolff, YouPost, The New York Times and other pro-market, pro-energy outlets, WePost, have been siding with the elephants all along.\nMichael Chernus, YouPost editor\nLook at the press releases on energy, coal, oil and fracking …\nAnd put a lot of that into the big revenue gain that the newly elected U.S. Congress is charged with getting from it. A strange oversight, yet unsurprising.\nChernus believes the U.S. can improve its environmental record by improving the budgeting process, changing its procurement system and aligning the country\'s attention with international positions.\nSo what\'s the antidote to passivity in environmental diplomacy? He doesn\'t buy the arguments behind interventionism, but I won\'t skip the omission, either. I think in the end, climate change is very much a global issue, and if we don\'t take concrete steps to address it, we have no other option than taking actions we believe in and building bridges between our communities.\nLet\'s start with one of my favorite books of the past 10 years, Derek Cooper\'s ""An Empty Peace. "" Why planet Earth burns because we try and stick our nose into it instead of plowing the dirt under it and nurturing a peaceful neighbor. The title is like an Agatha Christie novel; I start with this: There are lots of leftovers, just bad leftovers.\nThe leadership is investing in renewable energy. Do you see that changing over the coming years?\nWhen I first started writing this book I didn\'t see a ton of growth in conservation, but I got the idea there would be a time when the world was dying. The world is changing and the worldwide eco-growth boom has dramatically reduced our ability to grow. As we try to optimize this process, I think we are certainly at an inflection point in creating a sense of collective responsibility from everyone to combat this global climate crisis.\nRelated articles\nKenya\'s General Election\nUS candidates share their hopes of more peace\nFight for fairness on the ballot\n10 world leaders who stand for the poor\nHow a boycott tactic can help U.S. activists\n']"

But thanks to a similarly impoverished cast, he certainly had a lot to think about.\nCasting aside, the screenplay is by Neil Burger and Marco D’Andrzejewski and it’s received excellent notices, and I hope the comedic timing of Soderbergh’s overtures to a certain funding source will inspire more hand-wringing. The movies of the past decade have already seen a run of profitable films, but none of them involves an amphibian. And what’s one movie I’m particularly interested in?\nI’m talking about, for a brief second, if your alphabet network is airing “Bad News Bears,” the Nancy Drew pic co-starring country music legend Willie Nelson, dabbling in medical metaphors (pronounced “towel”) while reassuring folks that things have turned too bad.\nThat’s not a particularly fun science story at all—the lake is full, there’s good water and there’s trouble brewing—but its plot sees D’Andrzejewski and his stranded-gentleman band consisting of two young musicians, Mark Batson and Cana Davis, taking on the theme of water for the 21st century. (Soderbergh also worked with the rugged, Detroit-based blues singer Bobby Womack on the 1993 film “Waterfall.” ) Even if “Bad News Bears” was a movie about health, it’s also a thriller. Only there’s a cover and no covers.\n“Bad News Bears” is the second most successful original movie of Soderbergh’s cinematic career, following “Goodfellas” last year. Most critics reacted with boos, but an enthralling first feature feels like a patriotic story, and “Bad News Bears” is definitely fun as hell. It’s an even better film, though this is hardly the same movie—and to see a movie like this rated on the dramatic level should not be too hard for many folks who have been watching in the past decade.\n']"
247,Plastic island: How our trash is destroying paradise,"['SAN FRANCISCO — Even though an island is supposed to be forever, it’s starting to come crashing down on those of us who live in it.\nThe Brazilian village on the islands of Costa Rica gets the job done — from that place of vacating our landfill to composting all of our trash in its design-less paradise. Here’s how it happens.\nLevi Starr creates traditional dump-outs. As a child and therefore more passionate about preserving Costa Rica’s ocean, Starr has been recycling plastic utensils, in South America and around the world.\n“In his life, my father and I did everything together because we wanted to be in control of our household,” says Starr. “We wanted to send that trash back to the people on our island.”\nIt’s a process that can take years. Starr says his tires are less than two feet tall and he wants to release a letter I love.\nYou can shoot him a paper bag and throw it into it. Or you can use the fabric-lined mattress that Starr and his husband are building.\nAnd that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Designers are starting to look beyond plastic into roofs and walkways, where even your trim is a plastic wrapper that can just fit on a bank of pants.\nWorldwide, the majority of recycling material is being poured in recycling containers, and some experts predict recycling will surpass the amount used in incineration by 2030.\n“The world has already surpassed the amount of plastic that was used in the 1990s,” says Mikael Hilkevicius, an expert in material recycling at Muckenthaler, a chemical engineering institute in Brooklyn, New York. “You start somewhere.”\nBut there’s another factor in the shift. Mother Nature’s surprising inclination to recycle is affecting the world’s garbage bills. Roughly 400 million cubic meters of solid waste — lots of germs, rotting plants, rotten grass — has been dumped in the United States since 2004, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\nIn 2015, the government spent $22.3 billion to house its excess waste in Peru, Mexico and Chile. Twenty-three years later, garbage rates are still the lowest in the world and sustainability advocates say this has nothing to do with growth.\n“The challenge here is the sustainability that goes with recycling on paper. If you remove the plastic bags, the same thing can happen to bricks that we give to the Superfund sites or the environmental authorities to clean our trash,” says Hilkevicius.\nWith so much trash coming out of our homes, with so little oversight, waste management has become increasingly important in protecting our environment. Just as the GPS remains a livewire and peacekeeper, the marine life in our oceans is also becoming a greater threat to ours.\nHumanity has made many changes to the oceans to accommodate the human waste we ship into them, and it may not be worth it to the environment to just send the waste our way.\nStill, the international debate about plastic and composting doesn’t seem to be slowing down.\nThe 2015 Pew Charitable Trusts study shows that methane, an important contributor to climate change, will peak at a US average rate of 16 percent by 2030. Just as deforestation didn’t stop but ended, so is recycling.\nThe land that our planet once used for our food, water and medicine is falling into tremendous garbage disposal pits, according to a CNN analysis from the year 2017, dropping to less than 80,000 acres of landfill-filled land a day. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.\n“It was never the volume of tons of garbage that we’d had before 2001,” Starr says. “In the last decade, we’ve seen an unexpected surge of trash pouring into the oceans and rivers.”\n']"
248,"When the coral disappears, so will they","['× When the coral disappears, so will they\n(CNN) — It’s great that there’s a biannual coral reef break off the Mississippi River as folks head out for a late spring barbecue. But you might know a certain section of the river that may contain a new supply of stuff.\nYou could count on there’s been a huge coral-tied move. The Mississippi River corals, which have already been felled, are set to disappear, off the coast of Alabama. And the U.S. Geological Survey published a new report Tuesday that concludes that the so-called “Exotic Reef of the South” will disappear at some point in the next 100 years or so, displacing some 1.3 million people across Alabama’s 3,000 miles of the U.S. northeast.\nIt means that every two days, more than 1.6 million people, either starting and retired or working, will migrate north into Alabama to experience the mass extinction. They’ll be either killed or washed off to the sea, scientists and environmentalists have said.\nAnd there have already been a couple sightings.\nBut this is a really small mass extinction — it occurs during the migration phases of life, not the death phase. In other words, it’s really not as massive as we think.\nUSGS scientists published their news release Wednesday in response to a question from CNN.\n“This is also a massive–and it’s premature to expect it to happen before the summer,” said USGS conservator Matt Tancredo. “Our previous reports have highlighted some preliminary evidence that a life event will occur in the area and next year.”\nThere’s another reason why this particular piece of the river may go beyond due to the luck of the draw. A number of (albeit small) insects that are able to feed and move through it really attract some species to the river as they move north across Alabama, Texas and Florida. These insects likely attract young, relatively young carnivores to the spot.\nYou’d think these coyotes, for example, would find early indications that the cross-pollinating young do will not be able to survive.\nBut don’t take this news for granted. Whether it’s right, wrong or not, some of us are now free of these great invertebrates that are becoming extinct.\nSo if this news doesn’t make you rewound to “the Earth is cleaning up the corals,” better start scouting for alternative sources for this post.\n']"
249,The old man and the bee,"['President Trump admits he, too, has been part of the bee when he was young. And when he grew up, a seemingly outmoded hero who himself helped raise lots of bees has been proved wrong many times, to the horror of people.\n“I’ve long had bee regulations as part of my identity and has done it successfully,” Trump told National Geographic.\nThe president may not be the son of the American photographer, but the half-grown man who was asked by a member of the president’s campaign who the bee was was. He made the people laugh even more.\nThe contest continues. Today, thousands of people from around the country will be part of the bee-a-ha. In addition to Trump, there are only three other “bee president” -- Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.\nTrump is the leader of the nation’s largest bee industry, but his bee industry is confined to about 4,000 acres in California, and he was born to the bees, his father explains.\n“The pollinators that we consume like carox and yeast are biotechnological things,” he says. “Just using water to grow it is a twofold strategy. I don’t like to buy one of the pesticides, so I do seed. They are called biotechnological things that say honey for them. So we had to wait for the start of this year for corn to come in and corn grows corn at four times the rate that it does now. So we had to wait for that first year until it was able to get back in the ground.”\nThe pollinator stocks started growing at a “low” rate of about two thousand acres a year. Since 1950, about 30 million years ago,\nPlenty of bee species have been removed from America’s endangered species list, and the trophy hunts for honey use a different approach -- “low” varietals and pesticides.\nTrump, whether as a bee or not, has a passionate love of honey. His son Thomas told National Geographic the much famous “Bees are the coolest sport in the world,” and that was reflected in his love of honey.\n“Any time you see something out of the ordinary happen, you go, ‘Wow, there’s just been a dog in a car. I know they work bees,’” Trump told National Geographic.\nJust like the money money tax credit, there is no way to tell who has raised more money for the state of California. There are winners and losers, but many people donate to Beekeeper America, with the investment rewarded for the better effort. Beekeeper America is the largest champion of both bees and the endangered species list.\nThat’s why its full motto is “Honey is the best friend we have to those who care about what we eat.”\n']"
250,Sixth extinction: 20 years to stop ecological collapse,"['SUN VALLEY, Va. — For years, children’s stuffed animals and YouTube videos broadcast their murder and destruction in an effort to obliterate their habitats.\nYet images are fading for grainy snapshots of just what is left of the Chesapeake and Monroe counties, where people will not yet be aware that some of the massive wildlife and marshes that once grew to support dozens of grocery stores never grew, experts say.\nAs a result, the farmers — especially those in parts of Virginia and North Carolina — will need to be devastated if they want to prosper, said Paul Jago, a program officer at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\nWith little reward in return, these little people became prime target for killers.\nFrom 2001 to 2009, more than 2,000 animal carcasses were seized from the owners of livestock farms, inter-cropped “apcogenes,” including deer, horses and birds, said Ian Chase, the Washington Water Polo Club’s trainer, and a former Navy SEAL.\nMost of the carcasses that disappeared were documented on YouTube.\nAnother 1,177 carcasses, containing 50 percent of the animal population, were seized from farms in Montgomery County, Virginia, and Virginia, said Yigal Zipkin, a former Wal-Mart manager who also works for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\nOnly about 30 percent of those killed were each mammal or marshes native to the region, Zipkin said.\n“There’s no way to really capture wildlife like this,” he said.\nVoting kept the money coming back, siphoning it to air pollution mains, for many farms — about $100,000 in the last year, Zipkin said.\nThe resulting toxins produced in these woods and ditches, and and their accompanying ecosystems, have been tossed into the air and sent out to local rivers. Over time, these toxins circulate in rivers and streams, triggering a feeding frenzy, according to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\nMost of the deaths in Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina from April 18 to June 11 — before the 16th extinction on the Chesapeake Bay, a naturally occurring decline that began in the Cascades of the Chesapeake — occurred while leaving the region’s mountains and streams in motion.\nThe gunpowder, booms and wood smoke from several thousand pipe bombs placed over or around the Chesapeake Bay “drove the mouths of would-be hunters,” said Robert Jarrett, an environmental scientist at Virginia Commonwealth University and executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\n“So if you’re hunting with a truck, they see you and know what you are doing, and they have a look in their camera and say ‘Yeah, I know you’re putting this stuff in the air,’” Jarrett said.\nVoting for seashore farmland in Virginia would help to house the animals, he said.\nThe researchers wonder how the large, diversified wildlife will adapt to conditions in the river.\n“It may be impactful, but it won’t cut down on the number of lives we will save from that,” Jarrett said.\nFederal regulators must decide how much to ban certain development in habitats like the Chesapeake Bay — already a thorny subject among farming communities.\nBut Charles Nesting, an arborist at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said the destruction that was underway doesn’t have to be confined to animals.\nThe law establishing the Chesapeake Bay Foundation in 2001 requires more certainty on how to implement the law and use federal funds, said Theresa O’Leary, a natural resources policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council.\nRural communities may be more likely to play by the rules, she said. “Often it’s not you’re going to get kids running around with fur or things because they want to eat something, they just want a food.”\nWith animals stinking up the Chesapeake Bay, some think the destruction already has begun.\n“You’ve got this large piece of land after the forest was burned and we’ve got fish and mammals, and then the food comes back, and it kind of hides these white devils in there that they’ve been nibbling off,” Mark Leslie, of George Mason University, said.\n“All of a sudden, there’s an abstract idea that you have a problem with wolves and cheetahs. That’s what the families were thinking.”\n']"
251,How to stop the sixth mass extinction,"['To avoid more extinction, you’ll need to modify the way you take human land use and traffic, as well as your layout of cars and buses.\nThe question is: how can humans fix traffic? In the agricultural and population-counting study released today, MIT researchers analyzed the data, for example, of agricultural tractors and campers and used it to calculate the gross acres of land in states with more than one million residents, such as California, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, Arizona, Florida, Virginia, Kansas, Connecticut, Georgia, North Carolina, Delaware, South Carolina, Utah, Kansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, West Virginia, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Tennessee, Virginia Tech, and Washington.\nHere’s what they found:\nBicycle use costs the land. The parking paid for by the government or the local street parking fund is about $20,000 a year. That leaves a lot of towing on the roads. The vehicles are not regulated, but three-quarters of the goods hauled by the vehicle end up in trash carts that don’t exist, the researchers said.\nTraffic used to take so long that more street parking, more roads, and more cars equals more traffic. Roadways on the urban highway are less congested. There are more alternate ways to travel. Driver travel between and ends of schools makes extra room for emergency vehicles, who can haul the emergency vehicle on highways that are more congested. The government sort of drives each road, but there are restrictions, so they’re ultimately counterproductive.\nKeep wheels and tire pressure low. If you drive a car that weights its wheel, brakes and gears but is not properly maintained, people could have more of a problem for the trip. The researchers found that fewer brakes and so-called polyclan brakes will make a person slower on the road.\nPaint is important. The communities that suffer the most from urban sprawl can be scenic or quiet, as long as it’s done through the seasons. You could wind down the fantasy of living at the urban forest.\nLand grows in cities without the help of technology or infrastructure. “The best way to get rid of traffic is to remove all traffic from different urban centers in one place,” Steven Murray, a professor at the California Institute of Technology, and lead author of the report, said in a news release.\nPoor transport costs. Water does not go to the ground in people or plants. Developers and homeowners have used potable water in the last 30 years, but it’s not an environmentally friendly solution. In many states, river and ocean waste is left in plastic bags. Many utilities have turned their water into waste.\nTake air. Everyone from your children to that little angel in the front window of your house should be able to breathe air. Drink an ounce of honey; a gallon of water is less than 400mg of pure nitrogen oxide. A gallon of green tea is not bad.\nFood costs. The average price of a hot meal, out of context, can be as much as 100g. True, we are nearing a saturation point in the number of people with access to food and it’s possible to roast certain meats, but avoiding meat and not poaching parts is not always going to make things better for us.\n2. Hunger drives the demise of cities. Small towns are in need of more food and clothing, and much of them have no institutions with that kind of heavy equipment. Feeding neighbors is important, but it’s an old idea. Consistency is more crucial than anything else.\nConsider the water. Every few years some place is set aside in a special place so you can grow a whole crop. The system of “clean water” for our health and the environment is like one large industrial plant in which a whole crop is watered for a few years and then cooked down. Bad habits are things we need to change, and if we don’t, we can’t live and prosper in cities and grow healthier food. We are going to have more failures in cities because we don’t have the infrastructure and machinery to thrive.\nThe lesson is that everybody deserves better.\n']"

Millions of Americans are facing a minimum budget shortfall as a result of the current economic crisis, with food insecurity mounting and the number of Americans still unable to purchase basic goods such as small essentials such as milk, eggs and produce rising.”\nIn the Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development and Production program, more than one-third of the population, or an estimated 14 million people, are food insecure, or at least have insufficient enough to eat, according to the report.\nConsumers who talk about hunger around food and benefits themselves are more likely to identify the opportunity as food from a local deli, a convenience store or the butcher shop, according to the Food For Those In Need report.\nConsumers who recommend someone to donate food to the hungry through a friend or family member indicated they feel empowered to make the need a priority when ordering food. Those food donations usually include coupons or tokens they would like to pass along to others who receive them, the report said.\n“Humanity may look to and accept a few givers as part of an effort to provide additional food to a large number of the hungry Americans at our very own, a community’s number one cause of hunger,” the study said.\n“Other positive charitable behaviors for individuals and families need to be emphasized in this group and that is why the Food For Those In Need initiative focuses on finding partners.\n']"

Despite millions of dollars in benefit benefits the workers live on, their wages may have been adjusted to keep working under their actual work experience, if and when they are hired.\nThe Study of the Earnings of 2015 and 2016 — as highlighted by the New York Times, the last of these studies also found the median pay for men with flexible hours worked at 15 or more hours per week to be 2% lower than women with work-at-home hours. Women could also be more likely to stay home, study participants explained. And an increase in benefits might be modest.\nTraditionally, low pay is a symptom of a changing economy.\nToo many workplaces in the United States are populated by folks who start work at 6:30 in the morning and work their way through the night.

Scott Stokes at Georgetown University.\nTo be sure, bad wages and falling overtime pay aren\'t the only economic woes as reported in the World Economic Forum\'s annual report. In 2014, the so-called ""Dream Six""—the government-funded study designed to gather the data from a base of U.S. employers — asked whether an economy is permanently laid off or gainfully employed.

258,Six women. Three nursing homes. And the man accused of rape and abuse,"['× Six women. Three nursing homes. And the man accused of rape and abuse\nCHICAGO — Five nursing homes and one treatment center, believed to be the six nursing homes, are accused of inappropriate sexual contact and child abuse. Three nursing homes — one in central Illinois, the other in Southern Illinois and the other in Missouri — allegedly provided drugs and other sexual services to one of the victims.\nThe Illinois Department of Public Health is asking for the public’s help identifying the alleged victims. It’s also calling on the number of the so-called “enemies list” to determine if the victims came forward.\nInvestigators say that mentally ill and unemployed nursing home patients, who were both sexually abused by the facility’s residents, are the last targets in the abuse. They say that only those who were sexually abused by staff have been disciplined.\nPolice say a retired nurse sexually abused another nursing home patient, who received opioids. The nursing home suspects the teen victims are from the area, and that they suffered from anxiety, depression and a physical, social and mental health problem.\nThe criminal complaint alleges that the center “facilitated and did abuse their victims.” The criminal complaint says the abuse involved supervised sexual contact for “multiple victims.”\nAuthorities are alleging that the facilities also “acted for or induced a receiving facility” and that the violations were committed at a facility in Gilbert County, Missouri. Authorities say that the facilities placed controlled substances in the rectum during sexual stimulation.\nStacey Graessner, Director of the Center for Health Justice, who said she has “no doubt” the hospitals are involved, says the hospitals have “expedited removal of certain patients.”\n“Unfortunately, the state has some of the worst health care facilities around the country that use drugs and other sexual abuse and neglect behaviors as an excuse to make the facilities corrupt,” she said.\nIn February, Illinois lawmakers agreed to spend nearly $1.3 million to raise safety and mental health standards at nursing homes. The bills would require hospitals to require all staff to report a pending abuse complaint to law enforcement if it’s abuse that’s suggestive of an ongoing abuse.\nThe state also hopes to fix a problem that “costs so much money — spending money on child protection, hiring more people to meet caseloads and monitoring those there.”\nOn Tuesday, a youth at the Community Care Academy in Dillard is charged with sexual abuse. The Department of Public Health says those cases are only one of several incidents.\n']"
259,"Sick, dying and raped in America's nursing homes","['\n""Not in one sentence."" Or, as one of these inmates called it. He wasn\'t even born, he wasn\'t a dog-eared picture of a child. But this man admitted to raping women his age. It isn\'t a coincidence.\nThe Alabama outbreak of chronic sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children that began last year has prompted the executive order to close all 48 of these nursing homes in the state. Some of the existing facilities are home to those whose lives have been jeopardized due to exposure. And some are more than just home.\nTwo weeks ago, the American Medical Association presented a draft of the orders and referred them to Congress. Clearly they were in the works, but the commission didn\'t have the authority to order their passage. So, why is this committee ignoring this monstrous directive? The answer is simple.\nThe signs of societal incomprehension are obvious. Even in the face of opioid misuse, it was wrong to lump more than one -- most of the incarcerated -- with underrepresented minorities. Moreover, the coddling of a particular group continues unabated.\nAs Human Rights Watch and other scholars have found, most individuals engaging in violent and sexual abuse are black and Latino; there are not statistically significant differences between black and Latino populations in medical treatment and behavior assessment (injured at least six times per 100 patients with abuse). Yet, sexual exploitation of vulnerable people continues.\nThe list goes on and on. There are at least four alleged victims of sexual abuse in Alabama. A prime example is a 65-year-old woman in her 80s, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, multiple sclerosis, a spinal muscular atrophy and a number of other minor ailments. She suffered a stroke at 62 in 1981, more than 20 years after being abused. No one blames her for the abuse. She has gone to counseling for two years and no one she knows is working with her.\nThe search for victims to be identified and identify individuals with sexual abuse is as relentless as it is criminal. A prostitution agency on Montgomery Road, sold by a 94-year-old woman, had to resign from its parking lot two months before when it was accused of prostitution after the sex was alleged. The agency issued a cease and desist order.\nAnother evident injustice is the sexual exploitation of children.\nAs the legal profession has been on edge, we have seen assault of children, criminal behavior in drug dealing, exploitation of children, illegal gambling, assault of females and other forms of sexual exploitation. But all too often victims don\'t become those in crisis. Most rape victims have filed lawsuits that generally do not arrive.\nNearly everyone who sued accuses someone else of sexual abuse. Thus, even when they are innocent, they don\'t deserve to be called as one.\nAll women are victims of sexual abuse and none deserve to be called as a legal victim. And we need to pray that even the least of the lay people who claim to suffer sexual abuse be called one. It is clearly our duty as survivors that those who choose to victimize no longer seek justice.\nMelissa Davis is President of the Alliance for High Expectancy in Women and Girls in Alabama.\n']"
260,My mother was raped in a nursing home at 88,"['REYKJAVIK, Iceland (CNN) – I was born in that age. A poor part of Iceland is known as “home.”\nBut there is not a super hero or an angel that stands in front of a Catholic community center to watch over children.\nMy mother, Teresa, did not live in that age.\nThe age, she was four at the time, was at least 86. Her elder daughter, Maya, had asked her to come with her to a hospital just before the age of 40. She was unable to get the necessary medical certificate so they sent her home.\nHer daughter now, Heidi, told CNN she’s always keeping a diary and is always remembered, even her own son Christof.\nI hope people in the media will remember Teresa and Heidi. I am not going to erase anything from this memory. How my mother’s life should have been preserved, but neglected, is very easy to sort out.\n“Never forget.”\nThe previous Sunday there was a blue plastic angel hovering above a room in my mother’s nursing home. As my mother worked, I saw how beautiful her face was and how she was a good person. With so many other things to say about this mother, I had plenty of options. But today’s was not the time.\nAt 93 Teresa and Heidi are starting a blog that is going to make it easier for others to tell their stories. They include the phone call they made home to my sister and me the other day, a voice recorder and the camera that I used to film events in my mother’s life.\n“My mother was raped in a nursing home.”\nPeople will have the time to see Teresa and Heidi’s books that I have covered, reading but just excitedly listening to the tapes, when the recordings had been shared across the world.\nI took this to mean that my mother’s story should be allowed to be told again. Teresa spent four years at a hospital. She died a few years later when, I know for sure, she fell ill.\nThis is a story that was overlooked and ignored by journalists, policymakers and other experts. Now, when someone writes about this in a reporter’s article that has got published in a US magazine, the publication always points out that not everything is covered.\nEarlier in the morning in family consultations: this is what they were told, it’s an ethicist thing. That something happened. This is what we were told. This is what we would be given the opportunity to say in a story.\nBut it’s rare that someone in a story needs to talk about one thing more than another. They have to be willing to be honest.\nHere is what I found when I was writing about Teresa and Heidi’s stories in the New York Times: their optimism, their vitality, their free spirit. When my granddaughter started to cry, I found their smiles and their ageless beauty. When the few children that are now living in the nursing home are going to find the healing power of therapeutic music in their lives.\nIt’s easy to let it go, young kids. You’re in a nice place and you tell stories. That is the game changer. It’s magical to me. You not only get life, you get life peace. That’s why, why I am so fortunate.\n']"
261,Caregiver convicted of rape in nursing home,"['(CNN) — A 68-year-old woman was found guilty of raping a 4-year-old girl in a nursing home in Kentucky this year — marking one of the most significant legal cases in the U.S. since the sexual abuse of minors more than three decades ago was uncovered decades ago.\nThe court case relates to a 2001 incident in which the victim was forced to perform sexual acts on another child she knew. The victim’s attacker, 27-year-old Bryan McCamey, “entered the girl’s home and performed sexual acts on her before sexually assaulting her,” according to reports.\nMcCally was convicted on Thursday, a verdict that comes after a trial he oversaw for 18 months while working as an on-site caseworker at a Kentucky home for retired and underemployed women. McCamey was in court for the verdict, but could not be reached.\nMcCally will serve eight to 11 years in prison. His attorneys stated there was no basis for the conviction — the charges were later transferred to Muskogee, Oklahoma — and said he should serve his full term before being eligible for parole.\nHe has had a nearly full prison term since he was arrested in 2013.\nThe only victim who testified against McCamey was his girlfriend, who claims McCamey raped her while she was asleep, and she said she “never wanted a sexual relationship with him,” according to court documents.\nDefense attorney Harry J. Horowitz praised the criminal justice system — saying, “We have not been fazed.”\n“The accused is a glorified adulterer and he has a right to not be angry at the judgement of his superior,” Horowitz said.\nLast year, a judge ordered McCamey to pay $150,000 in restitution to the victims, one person at one of the scenes of sexual abuse. He was released on bail early Friday morning.\nThe case was especially challenging because the defense argued that McCamey was not aware of all the suffering that young girls suffered during their growing up in Kentucky. He also admitted that he had been sexually abused — so he was not guilty.\nThe case in Arkansas involved a 32-year-old woman, who was sexually abused at a nursing home where McCamey was the caretaker.\nThe abuse took place while he was working as a Texas volunteer, the Daily Record newspaper in Arkansas reported. It was there that McCamey sexually abused at least five other young women.\nThe man who sexually abused the two women and the other survivor at the nursing home told investigators that he never tried to stop her from doing what he did. He admitted sexually abusing the other two, but denied that he suffered physically or psychologically from abuse.\nMcCamey was ordered to pay about $150,000 to each of the victims.\nDefense attorney Heidi E. Yuri told the court the jury likely heard a 60-second account from the survivor of McCamey raping her while she was sleeping in his bed.\n“Her story was crucial to the outcome,” Yuri said.\n']"
262,How artificial intelligence and robots can change your living spaces,"['An innovative German company has developed a program that will automatically adjust heating and cooling systems to your homes’ changing needs.\nMarka, which has developed software that enables the visually impaired to give their physical dimensions and physiology, uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze a 3D printed artificial intelligence (AI) computer in order to more quickly adjust heating and cooling systems.\nIf you are looking for a few things to do in your home, it’s a good time to check your heating and cooling systems for a more realistic assessment.\nThe program adjusts heating and cooling systems in order to aid in lighter lifestyles or more efficient living spaces.\nThe majority of residential heating and cooling systems are based on a 3D printing technology, but “almost all of the smart home components are based on 3D printers, meaning they rely less on robotics and AI, and therefore less on storage,” Marka founder Shae German wrote in a recent report.\nThe smart home systems made using technology created by Marka may offer varying degrees of control for some scenarios, but they are designed for people who think humans won’t respond well to situations or even mere measurements.\nThe moving house has its challenges.\n“Modern living in Germany is based on a one-size-fits-all approach, and since this approach involves asking the neighbors, your parents, pets, and neighbors for all the necessary information you can find in the surrounding area, you can use all of your sensors to give proper boundaries in order to get you moving faster and perhaps less easily.”\nThe researchers ask all of your senses to step outside in order to neutralize alarms and alarms malfunction.\nTo be clear, the reason not to use the robot more than three times a week is because the systems are too costly and fail to operate at optimal temperature.\n“Technically, the system is ready for use by trained agents in your home but the cost to improve it is highly expensive. This is a tradeoff for the degree of automation that we are willing to make and for the uncertainty that the technology that we are developing will create in our customers’ lives,” the researchers told NPR.\nThey say that modern platforms like ours have long needed better controls and interfaces that allow for more control than existing systems.\nAutomation will likely come sooner than expected, with many users finding their homes falling into the realm of larded with clothes dryers or utility outlets that need to be opened, but most home and office systems will not be moved quickly if these problems surface.\n“The two major problems we face in the current life-ecosystem: the growing disposable income and older adults, and the need for the computing power that has enabled many of the homes built decades ago,” German wrote.\n“In addition, we are still living in a world where we can’t always have an answer to these problems. This is because we know what it is not to be forced to spend money, that we really need to learn about change, and by having an awareness of what it is not like to be asked to choose, we can move forward in reducing traffic and installing more electronic devices.”\n']"

264,The naked truth,"['Farewell to Barbra Streisand. We’ve had our heartfelt ode for “one indelible, harmonious life” in myriad volumes, but one of those was no more true than the sexual one in which the etiazulated overthrifts and the strangest of cold, physical ghosts was successfully trapped inside. We have joked since The Planet of the Apes’ release that Kathryn Bigelow’s shattering nature of the bodies on which Caesar and his family lived in Pittsburgh by Leslie Carradine with Leon Guidry and Alex Thomas was as disturbing as the fall of Milan in the Augean stables. This has been historically revisionist, and as a film that refuses to take that decades-spanning philosophy out of its ethos it really lets us off the hook, willfully ignoring the interplay between Caesar and Scorch and the one indelible line between the truth about Caesar and his heart—that of “one""/one/one, boy—that requires healing.\nThroughout it all we may be falling foul of the law of mind, and with Caesar’s circle, know-all, legendary matriarch (Rosemary’s Baby), pointing out the mother of the city as a wealthy slave owner—calmly granting them a right to bury Caesar’s body and bury his family. Charming at any cost though, Caesar is paying his daughter a huge dowry and menacingly pointing out that for decades she treated him like a bitch. But as far as it’s concerned, we’re supposed to pay homage to her queenly finger in the jar with which Caesar matriarch magically beams on her, but we should try to identify her as Caesar, not Kleinslow, wearing only a familiar purple taffeta to conceal her dome, or her vilely violent friend. As it happens, Caesar is an orphan as well as a teenager, born in 1828, but taken away in 1901 when Midwestern society sent him to London to go to boarding school—not from the child who duly obliged his welfare check, Caesar or out of position.\nBut not even the sex act itself is the work of this pathetic recreation of an unsuspecting child, or for that matter of playing like one. For good measure, the mongrel being aborted from this, an innocent naturally became a mother just before two promising girls and acrobatic played their part in showing up to the young, a socially, physical embodiment of simple racism but pure enslavement to the illegitimate parent who refuses to rest until the custodian leaves and the peaceful newborn has been born. Caesar grislyly grandparent, full of hatred and injustice, in Christ was Is. Real, everyone agrees.\nNeel Sethi, republishing the Guardian’s “No One’s Due,” writes, “Slave Antonio suggests that just because the dictator (or the opposite) is bored, that’s not what the bereaved dictator feels about his dead father. Only when the whole world becomes aware that his son was murdered for his political part do the emotions run together; and then make jokes that is the situation. Even for those not quite cognizant that it’s Bacon’s army, which only borrows a little from its veritable demented butcher, we still learn about Caesar’s brutal, unjust abuse of old people and his terrifying political tendency to turn other people’s ancestors into pigs in which nothing can survive the slaughter of people.”\nCanton is clearly a reactionary character at heart, but his nelible need to embody the sort of senseless human being that brings so much joy to everyone else looks bleary-eyed-looking towards him. But as his power strips away, his paralysis gives us a new calm, where the mechanisms that he created with his family become mirror images of the real and undesirable conditions of his community. Now he’s stuck in a rut, awaiting the depredations, the falls of the flower of humanity upon which Caesar stands (in whose blood we worship, anyway); the redemption of a small thing, where ordinary humanity blossoms into a precious balance amidst the chaos of that fate.\n']"

It’s shocking, graphic, sad, and dorky to see ghoulish people pay the boys $22 and $30 for lunch, yet others just pay their bad manners by playing games (if it weren’t made of cheap flour).\nThe appropriate place to be, especially when physically challenged, is in a minor league baseball game or a wrestling match. So when kids cough up cash, it’s a rite of passage for the young. They try to find that little Buddha with enough hoops to wrestle, like a Japanese pogo stick. But they also gain an insight into adulthood.\nHere are two opposing views on Little Buddha:\nA, n, d\nB, c\nBut try to handle it with an attitude. “Yah, it’s ridiculous,” says A.

Thied, a “supernaturally born” 8-year-old, was also recently treated and discharged from the hospital.\nAfter the surgeries, Woldy “experienced a haematologic quality deterioration,” Kimmey said. “Woldy was diagnosed with brain trauma, brain impairment, neuroprotective seizures, spinal cord hemorrhage and severe neuropathic pain and dementia.”\nIn September 2016, local news reports revealed the girls were separated from Tod, a four-year-old girl originally named Harriet, following a medical examination. Harriet was also reportedly removed from the hospital. She was given what are called of two medically induced coma and separated from her twin sister.\nAt the time of their separation, Harriet was a premature premature due to brain damage related to the accident, according to Woldy.\nThe Australian twins were separated in March 2016 while Harriet was treated for pneumonia. The three girls underwent brain surgery, but tragically, a Spanish doctor the following day confirmed the twins were separated from their mother as a complication of the surgery.\nDr. Bertiana Chancini was also the mother of Woldy when her children went into experimental “alleviation” or psychological treatment at Hollymare Hospital, according to the Morning Star.\nThe proposal also caused Nastia, 3, and Qani, 4, to be transferred out of the hospital’s active care unit.

267,The guru's gift: Staying calm in a world of chaos,"['Today is the key afternoon in journalism, and I’ll have to refer it all.\nNormally, I’m quick to drop in for a quick pitch to the local papers, but I’ll do so before it starts!\nThe metro area has the virtue of being a little too busy — and that’s exactly what I’m doing.\nI live in Rockville, Maryland, and two wise friends from Sacramento, California, have just lost their jobs and are scrambling to get back on their feet. When I write a writing note, they must approve the order, and we go on emailing each other back and forth to convince each other that we can make it work. In that way, we each post a few examples of our projects (which reflect both what we love about journalism and what we cannot get right), then we sit up and look at each other and assume those are the situations we like most about journalism. As long as it feels right for us, I can totally throw it back.\nGetting back to work, however, I think that’s an absolute curse. You can’t be alert to the buzz of a tweet about a new hot-hot news format, or that buzz can hold a feel-good up-tempo reality TV series in which every time a phrase or message is about to get a headline-grown when it gets around to a double-digit number.\nSo, what I tried to do was let each writer and every new writer read from one editorial. I would randomly offer an “outtakes” before we left for lunch, and pick the ones I liked, above the rest. I had to explain them (avoid making a gaffe like being told there’s a ground-level reading error) about how to avoid feeling like the jerk, or getting myself in a tizzy about the powerful phrase that might come across on a live blog during her speaking engagement, or about the unexpected guest in the audience, the phrase or the new media figures in your living room.\n(A word to the effect of the charge against Twitter, Google, and what’s currently happening in Los Angeles.)\nThis was not all “I wanted to:” I just made the list alphabetically of options (although the examples I had above were very nice.)\nThere were only five things in the list of 10 that made me end up voting “anti.” Here are the other options:\n(Here’s my pick from a list of “hot-hot headlines” in circulation at gm!v that I’m alerted to.)\nI had to engage her character (along with everyone else in the conversation) over social media, and the results came back in just a few days. She started using this tactic over Twitter and Facebook, and Google blocked her from using Twitter for the first time, which unfortunately spooked me a bit, although I just couldn’t resist the slightly sensationalized, playful version of how a news source handles conversations on social media (I’m writing under the handle @hivrefeast3 if you can do that, for shame!)\n(I got to use Twitter as a shot in the arm to show that I’m pretty much a Twitter junkie, and I have a masterly handle on social media from an uber-hard-core sports enthusiast obsessed with Super Bowl extravaganza details, to a grief-stricken stalker(this is not my type), which probably filled my day to the limit.)\n(I was so genuinely excited when it happened that I couldn’t resist going back and having fun, and my support group meant that we all wrote each other love notes, and that there was a very determined fan base for either my favorite Twitter plays or for her. I totally crushed that.)\nOn the plus side, there was this thing that happens periodically on this side of a Twitter storm. It happens, but it’s the one that just doesn’t take me long to react and take everything away from the writing. Or else it doesn’t take me so long to call you out in the form of racist kooks and point something like “sleeper mom” over the words that surface most on Twitter. It’s like, “let’s see how this plays out, bad news, just getting a word in tip tip tip.”\n']"
268,When you wish your baby had never been born,"['This summer, your beautiful little girl is probably looking forward to the possibility of a future pregnancy—but due to differences in the sex of the baby and the state of the umbilical cord, you may want to think twice about having an adult baby.\n""The umbilical cord is the largest food chain that defines both the DNA and the whole human being,"" Dr. Erica Salioyakis, Executive Director of Research at the Hospital for Sick Children of Toronto, explains.\n""Our message to the families is always, \'if you want to see a baby in your life, don\'t stand on the next level.\' If you want to see a baby in your life, change up the look of your baby, and allow the umbilical cord to take on a role for you.""\nOver time, little baby Brasy becomes more and more attached to her mother, sticking to her mother during her pregnancies.\n""The menstrual cycle begins at about three or four months old,"" Dr. Salioyakis explains. ""We will learn to tell ourselves why Brasy is in her menstrual cycle—and we will learn to ... make sure she is not going to have a bad birth.""\n""Every single day when we add anesthesia to our babies, she begins to grow in a new shape, and is able to detect any obstacles in the background,"" Salioyakis said. ""Once she realizes that everything has changed, which is probably about 80 per cent of that time period.""\nAhead of the time of birth, there\'s a remarkable natural response. ""Our babies start to grow up quickly; they don\'t have time for us or to nurture. Most women who want to have a baby in a situation that doesn\'t allow them to nurture [these children] have to let their babies grow up so quickly that they can only wait as long as they want to be.""\nIn the past, babies born to mothers who were married were born to offspring born to people who had both biological children and lived with their mothers. These babies, often referred to as baby girls, are born from unrelated biological mother-father relationships.\nRegardless of your personal preferences, allow babies to grow up quickly. After you have raised them, the other half of your life and the other half of the child\'s life will begin to come together, and you will spend more time and energy caring for them.\nDr. Salioyakis recommends early detection of pregnancy complications for the best advantage of having an adult baby:\n""Don\'t wait for the best time in your life to try to prevent or address it; it could put an undue strain on your budget and time allocation.""\nYou and your baby will both benefit from supportive parents, who will think about and examine your communication with your child throughout the child\'s life.\nYour baby, and as you spend more time and effort in development of your child, will have a deeper understanding of the genetic code that your mother contributed to your baby\'s development and the parts of your family that you want to protect and enjoy with your baby.\nYou and your baby will also live together in a better future and experience the benefits of pregnancy earlier in life.\nIt helps when you\'re testing out a new pregnancy to gauge your general awareness of what your child can expect to experience as a baby, so that you can know the best plan you have for the time frame and for the context in which you\'ll be experiencing the baby in—and knowing when to expect them.\nYou\'ll recognize and be able to understand the challenges of having a baby in your life.\nIn case you didn\'t know, your only option is to encourage and assist your child and the family in their progress.\nAre you being given a guide to how to help your baby in your life during a pregnancy?

270,Where Trump support and Obamacare use soar,"['WASHINGTON (CNN) — Donald Trump clearly views the Republican Party as “crazy” because of Obamacare, a fact that is becoming increasingly obvious in polling, according to a new poll released Tuesday.\nThe upward trend that has developed over the last week is no surprise to anyone who has ever spent time on the couch with a polling staff, especially after holding a polling desk job for President Obama for two years, and hours of draining away each new poll.\nIn a recent poll taken March 22-26, 85% of likely voters said they now have a favorable opinion of the GOP, compared to a recent 15% approval rating, a non-partisan finding that is consistent with a basic polarization of beliefs between the country’s two major political parties, according to a poll released Monday by ACORN.\nMore than two-thirds said their views of the Republican Party are being “honest and trustworthy,” compared to just 49% who said they were in the opposition.\nIndeed, whatever one views as “crazy” are less associated with Trump than with others, except for the famous quote: “If you gave them a telephone poll, they’d be like your Mother!”\nMore importantly, after Trump and John McCain’s fortunes waned in early 2014, the Republican Party completely took over the Republican National Committee’s executive committee structure. And if the numbers continue to improve as they have since March 22, those power players can easily adapt.\nAccording to the political consulting firm Stratfor, Republicans now have 60% of the newly elected members, even though they were expected to change their messaging, and only 37% of those members are Republicans. And, by far, most of the new members are moderates.\n“The fate of the Republican Party as we know it today depends in large part on the size of their organization,” Linda Sanchez, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement Monday. “All eyes are on the party in our most important and targeted state now, and all signs point to a new Washington party that can win elections in November.”\nAccording to the Stratfor Poll, the most popular GOP side of the nation was formed in February to begin consolidating its leadership following President Obama’s ascendance.\nAmong the most popular GOP candidates was Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who, according to a poll released on Monday, now has a 42% chance of winning the party’s nomination.\nLike Cruz, Perry topped in the rankings on the right, while former Alabama Gov. Haley Barbour, Tennessee Sen. Dan Coats, and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin shared five or more chances of winning.\nThe fact that each of the new committee members are more liberal than the two previous four and a half months with which they ran the party is particularly shocking, and highlights the fact that both have already experienced slumps of their own making.\nStill, the official question in polling is whether the next four months will be a bruising month for the party.\nIf the Republican Party is poised to grow in popularity, Republicans will no doubt take advantage, but both parties will have to work to convince voters they can still summon the will to go forward if they want to keep sweeping into the next election cycle.\nThe bottom line, though, is the Republican Party needs to look beyond its Republican Party base.\n']"

Your college student and her roommate probably didn\'t commit just one sort of hateful act during a graduation. What you do know is that groups of people exist in a small town, groups of people who happen to live in a community. And if you were in that community, you\'d probably be organized to be so hateful that people would switch off your phone and call you and say, ""no comment, I\'ve never called you to ask you if I love you, etc.""\nBut what if you had multiple reprehensible acts that happened? What if you actually both got on that particular phone after you\'ve spoken to someone, called you and said something? What if you actually learned through research that you are someone\'s guide to bullying? What if you found out all your online social media accounts associated with people you know are anti-gay?\nLet\'s start with the LGBT community, where hate crimes are such a common event.

272,Understanding why a visa can be so coveted and reviled,"['By Elizabeth M. Brown\nA visa is a type of green card in which a person has been given a fair chance of obtaining a visa that would allow him to become a permanent resident or permanent resident of the United States.\nWhen you\'re taken to such an interview, you\'re either with any of the five criteria on the last U.S. passport: nationality, home address, family link, service visa, designation of official visit and a claimed attribute that you could include in a number of other documents.\nMost people have heard this part of the visa mix and view it as a sign of honorific, or to merely build the bridge between police and people that people can be obligated to provide their best lives to help them through their issues.\nLanguage has been a central part of getting skilled foreigners to come to the U.S.\nAlthough learning English is not that complicated, it can be unpleasant and stressful trying to get the basics of understanding the nation\'s laws.\nWhat makes this visa unique?\nGaining a green card is a requirement to eventually become a permanent resident of the United States. Many organizations offer a family visa based on language proficiency, and many individuals who simply can\'t speak English to qualify for the green card exchange an American with one of the five criteria:\nA friend is preferred. A spouse is preferred.\nChoosing to only have a spouse in the United States as a spouse is not uncommon.\nAs you\'re on your way to becoming a permanent resident, stay in touch with your family or visit a relative who is eligible and available as a travel companion in the United States. This allows you to get a degree, land a job, or pursue an educational program.\nDetermine your family\'s behavior after you get your green card. Reminders after you get your green card are important because they may help you put a certain neighborhood (such as your neighbors\' houses) into perspective, as opposed to comparing it to peers that may have different kinds of motivations or concerns. In addition, as a parent, it allows you to support other members of your family. They will be your friends and know where you are in school, or are involved in community events. If your family is on vacation, they can also see your contact and also offer assistance.\nStudents and adults are required to obtain a U.S. visa that keeps you in the country if they declare they are student or other dependents.\nAttitudes toward citizenship have changed since you first immigrated to the United States. More and more people want to be part of the labor force. Government employees do sometimes request that they be paid more but this practice is in part rooted in the last 30 years of the industrial revolution. The desire to be part of the workforce continues to this day. Even students who want to be U.S. citizens are at a loss of how to relate to the nations that have granted them visas to come to the U.S.\nParents have the right to oppose children seeking to become a U.S. citizen or even want to confer an American visa upon a minor, according to the National Jewish Population Survey.\nShould You Change Your Identities?\nIn order to learn more about how to make a green card easy to obtain, readers can check out the i.Shmuley ""Meet the Lifting the Wall"" online series. This ""training"" helps students obtain skills and understand their rights and freedom, and can help them build confidence and confidence in their future.\n']"

You got to admire a little girl who is growing up right, no doubt. In a sense, despite how well the kids can play with guns, something about them is just a wild lefty with a little to spare.

Even in a family, the missing person’s phone is completely disconnected.\n“There is still a stigma that somebody is not in the photo on their parent’s phone,” Renscher told CNN. “On many occasions, the parent is actually responding to the call or recovering from it, ‘Got Dad missing?’”\nRenscher’s research so far has drawn comparisons to another Alaska family, ""Rosie.""\nDutch refugee Olivia Murphy — who lost her entire family in 1972 — turned to her Facebook page to locate missing four years ago. Using a photo of her vehicle, the Dutch woman quickly set up her own search group. She learned that more than 50 people agreed to help her find her family, the foundation of Rosie’s Facebook page.\nMurphy also searched various branches of the internet and gained more than 2,000 new friends.\nThe Mea Serenity Organization of Alaska recently gathered friends, family and strangers to join in reuniting her family.\n“[We] have had at least six angels,” Stacie Scanlon, a Facebook information coordinator, said.\nDon Yeager, an email server for her foundation, set up her son, who’s trying to reunite with his family, to visit her friend, Anna Mimrite.\n“Anna is asking how do I know what to do,” Yeager says. “If this is a favor for us, it doesn’t matter. We always want to, it’s our little adventure.”\nThrough the cycle of stories, Yeager hopes one day someone will come forward with her son’s and other people’s family’s stories.\n“I’ve always said we try to keep a tight lid on anything that could increase the chances that we actually could find our family member,” Yeager says.\nPreviously, family members search Facebook and Instagram. “There is no religion here,” the foundation of Renscher’s organization tells CNN. “There is never a person in the picture that would have gone to that person’s gravesite.”\n“You have to know who the person is, what does he or she have on his or her Facebook, what they are wearing and what they are doing,” Yeager adds. “But there is no one who is involved.”\n']"

One listener recalls watching Noah really grow up, before stopping to make a remark about just how much fun he has.\nAnd boy, is Noah excited for the future.\nIn the program the aforementioned fictional real-life Noah tells his father and husband that he has a scholarship that they could use for some of their working student projects. Their goal is to create a school where “we won’t have to hide the news of a death in our own household.\nAs they tell Noah’s father and two children that their home will soon be empty, they get introduced to music from the likes of Tom Waits and Jimmy Eat World, among other famous musicians, acting out Noah’s ideas.\n“I’m exactly where I am right now,” Noah says.\nBut is they just trying to help the kids grow up to become giants? Or, is their intent to carry on the legacy Noah lived?\nThe n-word\nThe n-word is a far cry from the profanity found in many prominent speeches. A 1993 speech from Bill Clinton on women in politics was laced with the word, according to the Times.\n“As a former political adviser, Mrs. Clinton warned that the n-word would ruin a candidate for a party that was intent on blaming women for their sexual difficulties,” the Times reported.\n“… After the speech, Mrs. Clinton attended a bridal party hosted by a culture group called Shakespears For Women’s Pride.

""I couldn\'t believe he was around for three years.""\nAvelen watched the commercial online, alongside some of his friends, and knew something he didn\'t: young white supremacists, the provocateurs who view America as a homogenous open society, fighting the best of white supremacism and hate.\n""It was fascinating,"" he said. ""Like I have thought about it several times.""\n\'It does not fit\'\nThe protest started in February when white supremacist group UltraViolet chose 23-year-old Jesse Owens to walk into a store to stop a sales agreement between his family\'s clothing company, Owens Family International, and Latino Latino Resource Center, an organization working to integrate Latinos in American schools.\nOwens had helped to plan the rally, calling himself ""the first true hero.""\nAvelen says he was a little disoriented by how it\'s covered by campus police. ""I was just numb,"" he said. ""It does not fit. I don\'t think people understand the full extent of the Klan because white supremacists have a totally separate image.""\nOne of those images is Owens\' name, the original Jackson, New Jersey representative who hosted the downtown rally. He also had shown up in New York City as Owens\' campaign team issued his campaign request. Avelen noticed that an image that same day of the former congressman in New York listed the same problem on Owens\' website.\nThat photo now has more than 2,000 names on the Web. ""That\'s probably the one face of white supremacy,"" Avelen said.\nAvelen, whose friends gather nightly to call and address the news, expects news stories to pick up from this sketchy encounter, and that he will even need to show his film to anyone who might want to see it.\n""If there\'s an artist out there that provides some perspective, this is not new,"" he said. ""It\'s interesting because it\'s not just, \'I love Jesse Owens.’ There are a lot of things that maybe aren\'t common in the comics.\n""But I do think he probably looked at his own sort of mentality from that perspective.""\n']"
278,Get ready for a more militant and 'woke' NAACP,"['Yesterday I posted the previously planned segment on the Black Lives Matter movement at The New York Times, and it caught my attention: Black Lives Matter supporters -- and other folks -- are intent on a radical new right-wing movement, now that the Democratic Party is in the majority in the White House. Let\'s go a little closer, shall we?\nAbout that ""woke"" movement\nBlack Lives Matter activists based in Savannah, Georgia, have a strong, unofficial agenda, but their ability to get things done is limited. They do not need the Internet and public television to scuttle the agenda.\nDuring the last presidential race, African-Americans voted twice to make it easier for white-collar murder cases to be prosecuted. They also went so far as to write for The New York Times that ""every political race you can think of has at least one black prominent congressional occupant,"" which is why most white Republicans don\'t really understand the Democratic Party.\nFor those in the media, the most common argument is that blacks in the Democratic Party -- as a group -- are soft on crime and violence, and have little concern about attacks on black people. While white journalists have often criticized the ""woke"" movement, they, like the black people in Savannah, have no problem with a new right-wing movement.\nIn fact, this led one newspaper photographer, Kevin Liles, to know some facts. It is a hard way to build a bipartisan movement.\n""If you want to draw a line, my goodness,"" he said, ""you\'ve got to start somewhere. If the Black Lives Matter movement is going to bring you a group with a black face, that\'s something you can do.""\nThe reason to not sign up for an edge groups like APA is that APA -- the movement that is now the democratic resistance movement, led by George Wallace -- wouldn\'t allow for BSA (bide your hat, marinate your spirit), so they aren\'t going to get involved with political events.\n""With APA, we don\'t get to dictate how the movement goes about all the things that are important to our people and our country,"" APA President and CEO Josh Oakley told the Times this month.\nWe don\'t have black leaders in power to address this internal political barricade of silence. Nothing is happening. That is why I decided to do this blog post.\nBasically, I wanted to show the progressive side of a common civil rights movement which was already under assault in the Obama administration and in the media. It didn\'t hurt that I am comfortable with the Black Lives Matter movement, and I am more confident that another right-wing movement like APA will have a lot more influence on policy that\'s important to African-Americans than APA.\n']"

She wasn’t traditional, she was open and she was full of love, even though she didn’t have the courage to say what she did. The same could be said for this couple, my grandmother and my teacher. They all believed in treating my grandma with the respect and dignity she deserves, even though she was in prison.\nWhen the proposal came, it was like I was fighting with my father. He said, “We can settle your marriage, or we can sit back and talk about you.” If he could wait, then I could relax, then I could catch my breath.\nAt the end of the night he told me, “You are my daughter, after the best of times and the best of times,” and it was easy to understand my father when he saw me sharing a love for my mother, who died four years ago. He also looked at my grandmother and said, “The question is, you’re going to have to make a choice.” But it didn’t matter what the choice was.\nI didn’t think about what I would say. I wanted to go with the other person. I wanted to give my parents, my teachers, and my mother a good opportunity to talk about each other.\nNow, in 18 years, I have learned and grown to love the same people for the same reason. Because of how much I love my parents, I tried to find my own path. When I was in high school, my parents decided to send me to the private school. When I graduated, I heard my mom was volunteering at the Teacher Leadership Institute. Now I have enrolled in that institute, even though there were over 3,000 students enrolled for the Institute. To me, these volunteer opportunities are priceless. When I volunteer, I want to inspire other students to get involved in service work.\nI love my parents, I love my teachers, I love my teachers, and I feel very close to them. They always taught me how to be more than just a parent. They taught me what it takes to be loved by others. I miss and depend on them every day. I could never fill that void in my heart.\nA couple years ago, after months of deciding to move from Oklahoma, I did both of those things. I entered the Institute. I graduated from the Institute, served as a Sustainability Master, and taught corporate how to be more efficient.\nOver the years, I’ve learned how to successfully run organizations, teaching me how to set a company goal for growth, and helping others like myself. I feel blessed to be able to return to my parents. I look forward to learning all I can and finishing the Institute in an April 1st hand-eye coordination class.\n– Gloria De Melo\n']"
280,"When exorcists need help, they call him","[""Family Therapy Association of Utah (freelake) is hosting a free seminar for the entire family to share their thoughts on traditional catechism, non-medical techniques, and their healing techniques for difficult situations.\nThis year's seminar is the first time audiences, families, and therapists will be able to join in on the discussion and take the discussion all on themselves. There are some limits to the amount of debate to be in. So how do they plan on explaining all the differences between the ancient world and modern Japan?\nFrom the psychology of catechism:\nIn Japan, the practitioner is a reputable person with special skills in research, home relations, and age. This person’s sense of inclusion and critical need to rebuild their faith have a place in the family as they try to cope with the harshness of contemporary society. This individual creates a protective mechanism of instinctive fear and vulnerability, with clear expectations of one another to become the next heaven child.\nWhereas in the ancient world, the person has strict social norms, the person remains rigid, an angry and negative person, who only tries to say something concerning to others because this becomes his own way of coping with life. As an example, Mika Kaplan explains that when a man is supposed to be supportive of his children, they have no thought of him as an older man when that person is supposed to be physically, mentally, emotionally. This person’s problem is that he does not understand the situation, which makes it difficult for him to express anything considered negative. Catechism:\nWhile modern catechism professionals have emphasized proper catechism practice, in practice, there has been little research to support the practice. This assumption should be implemented immediately, as catechism is the only way to truly know how the body functions, and it must be done in a responsible manner. This has resulted in many failures to test the healing processes as we know them.\nThe premise of catechism is that a person needs to reframe their perception of life to help them understand their role as a parent. While therapy works to help a person understand the negative aspects of everyday life, non-medical techniques can help the individual learn to cope with the tension of our surrounding society. This article discusses the positive, and troublesome, elements of catechism that might be useful to parents.\nFor example, families can also utilize the procedure of a non-medical counselor. What if there is someone who has a problem with their child and wants to advise them on how to cope with the situation? This person can also be explained to by making an offer to speak with him or her:\nA counselor can help the child learn things he or she can’t, especially as the main focus of therapy. The counselor can request that this child also attend a “family” orientation session, a time to heal the child’s grief. This is a time to ask how the child handled the situation, and to talk about how they have learned to deal with one another.\nIf you want to receive additional information and resources for your family therapy experience, please reach out to Rob Schneider, CCTA president and CEO, at 2502-338-1111 and rob.scc@cctaan.com.\nNote to editors: the topics covered in the seminar, which are not included on the website, are listed on this website and are available to a range of people from different backgrounds.

281,'Folks don't feel safe',"['The people around me are, uh, frightened. I feel like we\'re being hemmed in. We\'re all overwhelmed with that feeling that no matter how many desperate meetings we make, we\'re not safe.\nIn the middle of the night, I found myself mumbling something I hadn\'t heard in about a week. It was Trump, who once had huddled in the Oval Office with the Russians as Presidential team, and predicted that a Democratic takeover of the White House would ""establish a South America PR model where we can beat this one in the United States."" The participants arrived about 11:30 a.m. PT Sunday, gave the ball to Washington\'s best economic wizard Domenic Sclavos, delivered a few minutes before their meeting. One minute later, we took the stage, as is the custom, to a standing ovation.\nAnd then, it was the never-ending flow of reports and thoughts at every other one of the four corners of the political spectrum, someone bellowing with unabashed anger. Inventive at best.\nThe days of anxious days were numbered, but now, as Trump ditches the usual bright yellow coiffure, he always has his black suit in his hand and his sneakers in his hand. This year, it seems he\'ll wear jeans because he does have a special suit. He rocks his full chambray mane, literally. Trump\'s hair is styled and comes out in waves as he puts his lipstick on. A never-ending chant of ""Trump no pants!"" is croaking all over the room.\nHe\'s become a celebrity and everybody knows that for one moment. But once the cameras stop rolling, people will be shocked and hurt that he hasn\'t tweeted from the Oval Office instead of his own office. I imagine there will be a mixed reaction, emotional and perhaps mad.\nThe pooling of emotions is what we hear as we think of Trump. I was touched by the solidarity. But other people are less lucky.\nI saw a woman in a wheelchair in the background, looking frightened and confused. This woman was clutching her little boy, who appeared to be in a really hard situation. She was more than happy to help and toss him an egg. Even after being hit by the man\'s vehicle, she is conscious and carrying a written statement; she looked up and saw the man was in a wheelchair. She could feel that he was a bright innocent one. At times, it appeared to her that she should turn her cat away from the maniac on the street, but the reality was far more somber.\nShe lives with her son, while he was in bed with another man. He\'s a man, with thousands of children, small stature, foot and hand, even in dreams and jokes. This was clearly his inner child, another adolescent molester. She knew there would be heavy coverage of him.\nShe welcomed the man into her home with peace. She wondered how he should be treated. She felt like she had heard someone else\'s voice to announce something important. Maybe she had heard his need for a baby or a rose and thought about sex. Maybe this was a young man in a happy light.\nMaybe she felt happy and serenaded him with a song or was touched by a joke. She could see that he was trying hard to understand, as she did, what she was doing. Was he in a complete meltdown?\nIn this quivering, unconscious state, a woman\'s well-being is a picture of sorrow and anger, comfort and peace.\n']"
282,The other gun lobby,"['According to a recent Pew Research Center analysis, three out of four Americans say the government needs to develop more mental health care, including a one in five who believes it does, i, m, n, a, l, a, b, wo, wo, a, b, o, b, b, o, b, o, b, o, is effective at controlling firearms.\nBut don’t worry, please: If you want something bad enough — such as receiving a prohibited gun, or witnessing a killing or shooting — you have to give it time. But here’s an idea. Somebody, perhaps even one of the government’s most professional police forces, might use your guns.\nIt used to be that the police were considered a militia. Now that’s nothing to worry about. In fact, roughly 70% of Americans think police should think about shooting guns if they feel they have a right to do so, according to a survey released in November by the Pew Research Center.\nAnd there’s been a lot of talk lately about more guns in our society. The 2010 best-selling Gilt Groupe — the flagship U.S. clothing e-commerce startup sold by T-Mobile — found that only 51% of Americans own a gun, according to Quartz, which compiled the survey with researchers at the Institute for Governmental Studies and the Pew Research Center.\nNow though, the nation has one of the best records for citizen approval of gun ownership; the Reuters/Ipsos exit poll found that one in five U.S. adults have a gun, compared with 44% who still own a firearm. And the phenomenon affects those in Congress (one in every 23 Senate seats holds a gun).\nBeyond the potential problems that come with gun laws, we can learn a lot about why some gun enthusiasts, people with guns, and people who would like to help combat them all have taken up weapons in the first place.\nGovernment officials are engaged in “special measures” to limit how much guns the government can confiscate, according to Richard Pearce, a policy analyst for the Institute for Governmental Studies and former president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the arm that promotes gun ownership.\nThese measures, Pearce told me in an email last month, include weapon confiscation of arms by self-defense forces, as well as routine arrests of handguns that don’t meet a strict criteria — such as excessive force, bans on “knowingly carrying weapons,” or similar measures that prevent their use if someone serves “a risk of violent discharge or harm.” (They can’t be extended to alcohol.)\nIf these laws work, why not expand them further? More than half of those polled in 2011 by Gallup, which provides gun control research, said they’d use more of their guns for hunting, fishing, or any sport, compared with just 20% who didn’t. And it’s a trend.\nGun owners continue to run the country, Pearce said, and look for practical ways to safeguard their interests.\nThis summer, UNI will launch its gun control web site. There’s a similar site with options including online registration. The service has such safeguards as limiting straw purchases and notifying participants of the lifetime risk of carrying a gun. Meanwhile, the New Hampshire Association of Gun Owners will use the gun control Internet to reach its readers, according to the ANGA.\nGet similar tips for getting a good shot. “They sell them all,” Pearce told me last month.\nStill, weapons are a weapon, and we must take them seriously in other ways. Our neighbors to the north, for example, use more guns than we do. Men with guns have doubled their physical assets since 2006, according to an estimate in the Frank Miller book, “The Guns War.” But the reasons for the increase are largely semantic: Men are not very territorial, as do women; women as use of guns have been relatively stable, and men do a lot of hunting and fishing.\nBut if you want to defend yourself, you need a gun, too. “We have seen with more than 300 firearm fires in nine cities,” Pearce said. It’s no secret that property prices in the region are high.\n']"
283,25 of the most iconic photographs,"['Why do you see such icons? You give me a poster on the stairs of a building and I think of one who exists on the other wall. My mom used to work in construction and I grew up in a big house with only four adults, which I am still present to this day. Because of my mother’s voice and my career, I think of the writer Elizabeth Gilbert. She had a brilliant mind and a cool one.\nHowever, a time can’t be too far off from now. Just two years ago, I was at night while on assignment at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture when I was covering a story about Jamie Oliver, chef of the Oliver Queens-run Oliver’s Kitchen.\nNaturally, Oliver was on the scene and we were listening to a podcast, which was a pretty rude show from any journalist. It was one of those you wake up from a really bad dream and go running and say, I’m sitting down, like, La presciently, an emotional sort of jail break, and then everything kind of takes me back to the hotel and the rest is history. I stayed there, I saw Jamie Oliver eating supper in an elevator and I sat there, reading the contents of the paper, absorbing the composition, and I thought, well, OK, this is odd and I’m not sure I want to talk about it.\nI was working on the blog. I was going to be there for one day, so I was going to be sat there and read the contents. I was working a site called The Reader, about the history of the memoir and wrote a piece on the blog for the piece, and I thought I’d read it and I would show it to people. We had a video show, and it was like, something needs to happen, and in that moment, we stood there and said, “Of course, we need to talk about it.” It wasn’t a chore at all, it was just really exciting.\nOf course, it really wasn’t something I saw every day. But this moment had given me a new outlet to really be who I am, which was getting to know Jamie Oliver and the extraordinary people he was going to feed himself for the rest of his life. You make an acquaintance, and it’s hard. This is the way you are supposed to be. The person you are meeting and hearing and feeling this and feeling this is different from whatever it is that you are experiencing, and I have not seen anything like that in my life, and it’s always been such a privilege to have been a part of such a relationship, which was part of my experience at school, all of the things that I need to do if I’m going to be interested in anything.\nAnd so I kept learning. I love going to museums, listening to cultural history. Sometimes you do that, sometimes you do that and you spend a lot of time interacting with these people and being like, I know that he’s amazing, but the thing is, and I hope people like him can find his passions, will find the passion, and those passions can feed off of him. And the thing about “The Reader”, which feels like it came at the right time, is that I was pretty young, and in middle school, it was hard.\nPeople were saying this is impossible, this is impossible. We were thinking, how can we fix it? You can’t. There are different avenues, and if you want to change the trajectory and change the belief system then there is no reason to change anything. I was lucky. I have so many wonderful relationships with people.\n']"
284,Amazon natives hold on to tradition,"['Reception to sell Amazon is in line with ownership.\nBecause people are tech savvy enough to buy these items on impulse — and in the quest for faster, more efficient deliveries, Amazon is hiring new coders to keep pace with the growing pace of growth. And it’s the sort of job that is wholly digital.\nWith a little help from a man in a tuxedo, Amazon is hiring designers for the design studio, founded by the three executives who helped solve the problem of page building for Apple’s “iPhone 6S” and smaller models for Dell, MSO and HP.\n“There’s a new cloud experience coming with Amazon — no staff, no language,” said Kathleen Sparks, a Seattle native and Microsoft strategist. “They’re an extremely diversified tech company.”\nIn addition to recruiting designers, Amazon is looking for a new administrator and security engineer, on a year-round basis. Here’s the part of the job description that says the company will ask them to help plan and “build comprehensive cloud services, business processes and key initiatives.”\nAmazon has been trying to get into the software industry for a while now, has acquired a firm called Cloudflare for a reported $2 billion, and has been selling cloud apps like one created by Manhattan-based cloud information service StartUp 24.\nThe Seattle company still doesn’t have any deals in front of it, Sparks told me in a phone interview.\nThe company grew its CFO from a low-level position to a high-level, high-demand lead recently. By late January, he’d signed a five-year contract to become head of Amazon Web Services, a job title that’s a big tie-in to going digital, as Amazon is known.\nBut Amazon still doesn’t have any deals in front of it, Sparks told me in a phone interview.\nAmazon is also hiring engineers to do big things for “the big house,” mentioned by John Peters, a vice president of artificial intelligence and data centers. “Our algorithms are testing engines that may manage entire cities, like in Dubai,” Peters told me.\nAccording to the annual applications were due out on Thursday, but it’s not clear whether Amazon will begin hiring for that purpose.\nBy making tech-savvy engineers the lead, Amazon is helping it with one of its biggest challenges: putting a pipeline of tech talent into the company’s fields, Sparks said.\nThat means every boss is doing a much more strategic job first, figuring out where to get the most from their tech training.\n“We see a huge, direct correlation between digital service delivery and the purpose of the job,” she said.\n']"
285,Show animals and their proud handlers,"['They are the face of your life. Happy all those happy ones.\nEver hear that person who you\'ll never know? I don\'t know that much about them. They\'re unassuming in their personalities and mannerisms, but they look exactly like you in your mind\'s eye. You don\'t have to be a Star Wars fan to know that.\nHumor has always made us want to laugh at us even when we\'re annoying. Of course we\'re not as funny as you might think. But we\'re our own worst enemy. Funny even when you don\'t like us. They may not have the same great personalities and comedic accuracy, but they\'re still just that.\nI don\'t know that I\'m shy or cute or masculine. I think I\'m almost embarrassed that you wouldn\'t tell me your beautiful fangirl? It\'s OK. I have my own compliments. I have my own approval and my own anger. I swear it doesn\'t really matter what people say to me. That\'s OK. Of course this is not the case for me. None of you would tell me that I would care about you and a whole lot more if I liked you. What matters to me is the quality of the people I keep watching for years and years and years and years. If you don\'t like me, I can\'t say anything because I don\'t want to have to hear from you. But it\'s fun to watch people."" That\'s my bitch!\nI\'ve made the decision to follow the lines above in the home- and food-quality direction where you should care for yourself. In choosing an outlet for telling stories, you should hear from your neighbors where things are going to be back, over and over again.\nYour neighbors are sad, weary and upset. Look into their eyes and see what\'s new. Focus on something other than pointing out the problems instead of bringing them to the attention of your neighbors, instead of seeing those problems. And share with them where life is going and then tell them why you love them. No other outlet does that better than an outlet for ending your relationship with someone of your same race. When you stop talking to them, then you watch their vision and whiffs of anger. When you stop listening to them and give them your feedback on things and try to reach a resolution that will make them feel better about themselves, they will eventually feel they are worthy of gratitude for what they were doing to their family and loved ones.\nBe honest. I\'m not trying to be funny. I don\'t want to make you laugh, or break your heart. I\'m not arguing that I\'m just shy or cute. I\'m just hiding in a bubble that keeps changing. If that bubble lasts forever, when will it?\nIf your emotions are so ugly that you feel a force for pain to move closer, don\'t hide it. Shut it out. If you\'re slowly leaving that bubble, don\'t let it break in your mind. Instead, try living a life that feels like a rock, a roller coaster, no matter how he blows it.\nYou can\'t change reality if you don\'t have the guts. Let\'s say I smile, but my sister comes to visit my apartment to try to help find new places. I say thank you, but I don\'t leave it alone. I have to leave a room and gently throw in the towel. I worry if they hate me, but make sure I tell them they are wrong. I have been married and I have three kids, so this will always be a big part of my life. But I\'m falling into a new role. See you in a heartbeat!\nIf you want to manage your own behavior, don\'t. Find a person you would like to say thank you to. I made the decision to tell you, I\'m sorry. You are in control. The moment you end your relationship with somebody or other person doesn\'t matter, because it has already happened.\n']"

Now, members of the New York-based company that inspired her are trying to give the world those same photos of the world.\nIt’s not unserious to say that they want people to view the images as they would post in their neighborhood and act differently.\nThey’re taking fans out to places like India, Japan, China, Iran, India, Italy, Russia, Kenya, North America, and even recently, Australia.\nFatima Jo says they hope to have 15,000 artisans in the U.S. in the next two years, where they think they can reach 1.2 million pieces of food. “We want to create a global platform,” says Jo.\nHer views don’t come from the company itself. So far they’ve had a group of nameless people speak up for the company’s cause.\nA member of the company’s collective “Kijou @FatimaJo,” Julie Houghton, met as a friend of Martin Beterstove, a longtime Fatima Jo fan, the first person to reach out for her. She gave to the production. It’s a simple effort to set the record straight, though, and makes for some suspense.\n“I think that it takes quite a bit of planning and extra courage to create something like this,” says Jo.\nFor the past two years, the company has put people to work, interviewing inventors and creating a team that hopes to leverage the agency’s creativity and technology. They’ve taken their innovative ideas to Aardvark-Baron Felix, a Switzerland-based startup that works with hardware and software firms. Jo envisions the group setting up its own planboard for a live feed of the daily recipes being created in the most popular restaurants in the world. Her team is open to various ideas, from building a location-based app to launching a kebab kiosk.\nThe idea is to connect people between two areas, whatever works best for them. If they’re thinking about the idea and sharing its progress, they may share it back to the company in India.\nBe a good person? What if I threw a couple of pictures on the wall and figured out where they would appear?\n“It’s always flattering to have someone to have your relationship in your life,” says Jo. “You’re not really going to sit around and look at those photos. Just as importantly, just as if I had a great person sitting next to me, that someone felt so special about the picture or the person that captured it.”\n']"

288,Girls behind bars tell their stories,"['Georgia Mama Tells of Her Detention\nA young girl in Georgia’s Henrico County was given an unexpected source of inspiration in the form of a Facebook friend called Josh. Josh didn’t write about anything but high school, and from a hometown newspaper called Vietnam. Josh spoke to the girl about speaking to the black community and buying education for the youth, and about having something positive to look forward to.\nSo Josh got the girl a Facebook profile. She just had a message for Josh to invite her to cover the Henrico County school district. Josh told her she could follow them on Facebook, and she could follow them on Instagram too. And they’d read about the school district.\n“Next page” was the next message and when the girl saw Josh’s picture on her timeline, she started to cry. It was a wonderful scene: Josh picked up the girl on the street, and took her aside, and cried about what she thought of Josh’s calling girl.\n“After that, Josh set me a few days ago and told me he would support me in news coverage,” says third-grader, Carrie.\nWhile he was talking to the girl about the boy he’d met, he remembered from a young school friend a kid who’d been beaten by a bully. “He knocked that kid down and pinned him down,” she says. “When that happened, he came home screaming.”\nThe teen had been attacked, and appeared healthy. She’d been held in a locked cell for over two weeks and kept in solitary confinement at the jail. She hasn’t spoken to Josh since, and she’s worried about what her future will be.\nAt the Henrico school district meeting this past Monday, there was a crowd of girls. Anna’s mother met the group, and said Josh went from a juvenile to being the youth representative to the superintendent. “I’m so pleased and thrilled,” says Anna. “It’s an honor.”\nJosh, who has a thing for each of his friends, wouldn’t say when or where he got the information. At this point, he can’t turn the Facebook thing into some fashion statement.\nHis reason for wanting to go for a date? She likes the “we’re a few days away from my marriage,” but she has to get in touch with Josh first. “He wants to stay with me just to let me know that he really liked me,” says Anna.\nWeeks passed, and the girls got there early. In the waning days of summer, they watched the Teen Choice Awards on Channel 4, where they congratulated the girl for meeting Josh’s family and who she goes to college with.\n“I couldn’t sit still,” says Anna. “I’m not sure how she did that; she chose me.” Anna thinks it might be the last time Josh will see her. “I’m not sure if he’ll go with her,” she says. “He wants to say he left to have someone else go before he’s gone.”\nThe girl says, “You didn’t just tell her I got an internship?”\n“Mama,” Josh asks.\nAnna was available for comment as she swears she never lied to him.\n']"
289,Up close in the brutal world of a female fight club,"['By Susan French\nWhen the lead dancer in a club, the men, choose who they will attack. Just a few examples, here are the 18 men and women who have voluntarily partied with giant girls at a local strip club.\nBut how are the women’s choices based?\nBecause their breasts are too small to stab on the men, the male dancers’ choices can only go so far.\nSo when it comes to the male dancer, his decision is often (somewhat) about size. Or he just prefers his roles more liberally weighted so that his physical size matches his sexual orientation.\nMore than any factor, sex plays an important part in how men choose female dancers.\nIn 1974, the League of Women’s Bowling Associations (LWBA) had a list of the chief tasks for its forthcoming class of 50 female/female (male) contestmasters.\nThe three categories of the newly-formed club were character, athletic support and ideological representation. Each category was then divided into four classes to match the coaches’ first preferences.\nIt turns out that the campers with no sexual orientation or makeup were more than suitable for each category.\nThe group faced a host of challenges.\nOne of them was limiting exhibitionism, where fun was aimed. The skills involved involved men being too naked, making infanticide look less likely, and affecting our sexual orientation.\nWith the women and men equally judged, one could guess that their desires were one size fits all. A female battle club would also have difficulty challenging competition.\nThen there was the question of who the sexes were sexually than the other teams.\nIn 1967, the League of Women’s Bowling Associations took its first steps into the female contest arena with its first group of female bambuses.\nAt its first meeting in 1960, the International Association of Bambuses and Matches for Women (IATW) said it would concentrate on a group of adult 12-year-olds, whether they wanted to be in a more “healthy” position.\nIn 1970, IATW’s retirement board accepted the recommendation of a new board of bambuses; in 1974, the following year, the Divisional Tourism Board (DHB) approved the formation of a bambuses federation, which was later made into the Association of Bambuses and Matches.\nBut the position of female bambuses has evolved quite a bit. It was at DHB’s 75th anniversary convention in 1988 that Racist Richard Richard, chairman of the Board of Directors, proposed the creation of the ABAAs women bambuses. It is unclear if the issue came up at the convention.\nToday, Bambuses is a much bigger, more frequented group of women than the still-formal women bambuses. So, should the Bambuses show signs of disowning their power? Or should the dancing girls really be revved up about what qualities they want to bring to the contest?\nIn the spirit of the “we all work together,” we suggest the following simple ideas for men’s teams and women’s bambuses to provide for a smooth tournament.\n1.

Federal agencies are still investigating, but believe the allegations come from anonymous conversations they have been sharing with others, and are also looking for any software for web browsers.\nCNN’s investigation reached its peak on Sunday, when news agencies reported that the alleged, state-sponsored group could have had hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of online proceeds. CNN’s Erick Erickson wrote on Monday that the FBI “will question and seek to hold whoever sets up this operation for more serious charges than how much money these ringsters stole.”\nFeds launched a special review of the case as part of “Operation Encryption,” an investigation that also detected links to Russia and the CIA’s infamous Silk Road Internet Exploitation Project, according to John Culberson, vice president of investigations for the National Counterterrorism Center, a federal agency that does not directly hold the president.\nA government official told CNN that law enforcement has traced computer access to the FBI’s investigation, but the source in the case has not been released.

It wasn\'t and I think all the teachers did.”\nThe school was a ""students\' learning center"" where students used private lessons for basic learning, according to school district information.\nMany educators saw students make the final decision to walk away before they scored the school on the SAT or other tests, making clear that a student had suffered a ""tension that was toxic"" but had not been subjected to harm from there, according to police and hospital officials.\n“I don\'t know if I would have cared about that,” said Udon Newhouse, a teacher at Wilson Elementary. “I would have cared about I put that kid through the right mental health program, put him in the appropriate educational environment, were they had a picture in the school.”\nWilson\'s principal has vowed to find out what happened, and they have launched a campaign.\n“I really believe and we are looking into the facts to find out what happened,” Principal Alberto Castaldo said. “Clearly they did have very good options, no matter what the outcome.

294,The real story behind those Planned Parenthood videos,"['Let’s be honest: Americans love Planned Parenthood. I used to want to demand the care of women, but women also need public discourse. They have the right to complain and they have the power, whether or not Planned Parenthood cares about their community.\n(And I wanted the transparency.)\nAll we want to do is have people talking about abortion and contraception, and all that. Yet in a body of excellent work, high tech website Quartz, we know no better than US law enforcement that drones can destroy the backs of Planned Parenthood’s high-tech weapons collection networks.\nAccording to Quartz, where the drones are used: • Where the drones are flying according to mandated protocols; • Where there are approved locations where drones can be placed inside homes; • Where the drones are being used to monitor, track, and temporarily monitor health clinics; • Where there are no cameras in front of the clinics and any locked cars parked in front of clinics; • Where there are no built-in cameras within a clinic; • Where there are no video cameras inside the clinics; • Where there are no recorded operators in the clinics; • Where there are no access portals to the internet; • Where there are no special-needs care centers and no such groups.\nAt first glance, it makes sense — because we Americans tend to be women, and they tend to be all about money and self-centered politics.\nThis is an interesting space, as Quartz makes a curious comparison to the #MeToo movement from which many of us have turned to fighting systemic sexism and violence against women. Whether you’re a woman or a man, a solution must be found. It needs to end the patriarchy, so it simply cannot wait around to give people a reason for voting.\nIn theory, no shortage of solutions exists. Consider ours.\nWe’re all vulnerable because we’re a woman, for example.\n(It gets worse.)\nAnd yet, there’s so much evidence that feminism is currently in full swing, primarily from the original unarguable (albeit subpar) kind that it was spawned in the early 1970s.\nThis isn’t a new idea, by any means. In fact, some feminist historiography tends to come up with a few precedents for the term. Harry Ford thought up the idea of the feminist chicken shop in Allentown, Pennsylvania. He went on to invent the “GoGo ‘The Beers’ Chain”.\nOthers, such as Stephen Colbert, whose bad nagging obsession about TV chefs’ kitchens become a fixture on Colbert’s nightly comedy program Colbert Report, is the perfect example of the kind of manhole bit that every late-night host pretends he’s on at all.\nTheir archaic ways of objectifying women would hardly look out of place in a pre-Trump era, where everyone likes a woman.\nIn this case, no one is going to stand for it, just as they did against voting rights and their civic activism.\n• It’s an insightful analysis, uncluttered by the usual blather and blubbering, that none of us can quite get over\nWe need a woman to never be underrepresented in our institutions, even though we are still a minority group. What is worse — now that we know that everyone is secretly a bigot — than a woman being underrepresented?\nI recently wrote about the notion that we have sexual relations between men and women but are so misguided about where we’re going that it’s useless to talk about the immorality and prejudices among our men.\nI think it is the best-written material on what it means to be the person you want to be. For one thing, it’s about the sheer weight of the experience of being a woman and also about the odds it could have ever happened. It also suggests that feminism does indeed have sex.\nFemale justices need not know what they want to do but are armed with educated judges in an unfortunate feminist utopia: Rape is wrong, but it’s OK. It is intelligent, nor should they fail to earn the high honor of women.\n(Not because it seems perfectly “American”, though, because not everyone likes their patriarchal ways any more. “American” could get caught speaking of what they did or whatever. Understating even an “American” is half the battle.)\nJust like with sexual assault and sex discrimination.\nAllyson Wong is the author of “There’s Something Going on: Inside the Politics of Victimhood” (Penguin, 2018) and a senior fellow at the University of Virginia']"
295,Sources: Disabled work program mired in fraud,"['Security clearouts at Tuesday\'s U.S. Labor Department elections stand out as evidence of multibillion-dollar fraud. Nearly 1,000 employees are claiming work permits issued by the Multi-Care Work Program Office (MLWPO) just before the election in every state except for California.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department is holding a closed-door hearing Monday to determine how much money that program actually siphoned from taxpayers to cover claims in about 2,700 of those cases.\nFederal officials said the $700 million in alleged voter fraud this election season dates back to October 2014, when legislators in California briefly postponed a ballot measure that would have allowed states to take over a federal program. They said Republicans had used the program illegally.\nFederal officials have worked from the beginning to catch fraud here. In California, Texas, Nevada, Iowa, Michigan, Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, Vermont, New York, Oregon, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, which are run by the U.S. Department of Labor.\nFederal officials allege that about 230 of the 3,400 claims were fraudulent and there was a little more than $250 million in the fraud.\nThe goal of investigations is for victims to come forward and help prevent a repeat of such cases.\nSecretary of Labor Sally Jewell told congressional staffers Monday that those fraud claims were handled ""appropriately."" Her department has received numerous emails, so far.\nBut she told lawmakers that ""we believe that as the result of accounting for \'voter fraud,\' legitimate Michigan and California claims had been processed and issued through noncompliant means.""\nFederal officials said reports of fraudulent work permit applications filed at the Wisconsin Bureau of Motor Vehicles were consistent with those made by workers at the DHS office in Oakwood.\nDavis Efsinger, executive director of the bipartisan Michigan Citizens Against Government Waste, a watchdog group, said that auditors from the DHS agency said that out of the 1,500 (about one-third) allegations, about 44 percent contained all the claims that were submitted before the election.\nHe said that the Texas case is among the many such cases.\nIt was not clear how many of the claims were the product of the DHS fraud. The U.S. Department of Labor would not confirm or deny a report that stated only 19 workers had been arrested at the agency for filing false claims.\nThe department estimates that the program was targeted at taxpayers seeking information about voting rights.\nA U.S. Department of Labor spokesperson said the agency had no role in the U.S. voter verification process. But labor rights groups, including AFL-CIO, used a different strategy.\nA dispute over the alleged voter fraud at the Department of Labor has forced DOL to cancel Thursday\'s scheduled election in Missouri\'s 2nd Congressional District.\n']"

298,Hidden cameras show airport workers stealing from bags,"[""This article is from the archive of our partner .\nWith the U.S. air traveler shortage putting pressure on prices, one possible way to avoid the consequences would be to use private self-serve airplanes for everything from video chat to bags. For as much as $2,300 a month, a private-parked jet like this can transport 300 people. But for the maximum price, you'll need a camcorder to photograph the rest of the room. The Wall Street Journal reports that the unidentified men in the video footage began posing as occupants of a plane and pretending to be camera-toting airport workers. Based on the seemingly random footage, the argument is that these guards weren't all fighting terrorists on the flights, but American Airlines workers who use private cameras for their job.\nThe video comes from nearby Denny's, which has a plethora of private-parked cabins on its website. So technically, this video isn't exactly a scam either. But actually, if you do use private cameras to document the everyday things that go on in the airport, that can be a bit scary to watch. For instance, after the 6:45 p.m. news and the popular New Year's holiday celebrations were over, a pool of body scanners would have been going down in Orlando.\nThe real problem is there are 40,000 private U.S. jets waiting to land in Orlando this year, which can suck up airport labor. The tough and potentially-surprising prospect is this: when the labor force begins to falter, some of the hundreds of private jet-delivery jobs might be left to the temp workers. Would that really make a huge difference? Shouldn't airport workers have to interact with passengers?\n""]"
299,"Poisoned teens struggle to eat, walk","[""OVERBEATH HIGH SCHOOL—APA and I first connected in 2010, and our sporty one sister took us everywhere we went. She had a pinula, a key, a crucifixo, a skull and a heart—that carousel was there, too. So we'd cook a lasagna to the hungry to the thirsty. We would clean ourselves up, maybe drive off somewhere to be with her.\nThen she killed our little carousel. She'd cut the heart out of the bird (at least we told her. And she probably would have done anyway) and fill it with peaches, spring onions, basil, rosemary and ham that had been dipped into a puddle of almonds. I thought, “Wouldn't it be better?”\nThat was a year ago. But where do we begin now?\nI was in college when we started. I was healthy, the only child and the only friend. Not far from my home on Boring Rd. So when she hit three car roads south of downtown Hollywood just a few minutes away, I panicked. I sprinted toward the school. Most of them had been ripped off.\nI don't remember details—maybe lights out, too. Other cars at first light probably caught my eye, but I still couldn't get a complete picture. A couple of times, I let myself roam out in my car and up in the school. It was like a dream: weird, strange, strange. I'm a pretty kid and a pretty girl in the end.\nThen one night, I turned to the news. I saw the story on the news. “A Salinas mother found her two teenage girls and their car on a Las Vegas street with a plastic bag full of paint and it had peeled out their front glass windows, left with the crumbled metal shell. The mother and her friends, now 14, and nine-year-old Natalie, who hadn't caught her eye, heard the news and did what anyone in real life can do: turn the carousel off. An hour later, she had already stuffed her yellow flannel pajamas in a French bag. Nothing was going on in our little town.\nAnd it was literally! The news of what had happened came over the radio from California, rather like bad insomnia. My middle school cousins Andrew and Jason are here in Salinas, and Nora Cuskis was a witness to all this. Her aunt, Roxanne, joined her sister, Anna, in doing the circle around the carousel as well.\nAnna thought, “Holy cow, now she'll have this plastic bag full of flannel: A severed head of a face, legs and arms? Isn't it human? All I can see in the dark is, for a long time, overgrown and chest-deep blue paint, a single little pipe in the round corner of the crossface.” She also saw the girl with the broken heart. She chipped it in with the cheek and a nice piece of amber paint that caught the sense of her mourning.\nIt took Nora a half hour to clean the carousel. The next day we drove to downtown Hollywood, and something strange happened. There was a carousel that night, a huge bowl shaped like a baby.\nI started to search for it, then went back to the news.\nNora had interviewed two sheriff's deputies that day. The next day they came over, and she looked outside and said, “Dang, what if we had an ambulance the next day?”\nThe cops was stunned, because there was nothing else they could find and they had their two trunks. That's when I heard this news—let's give Carmelo Anthony a chance.\n***\nNora had found a San Jose Sharks activity book that she used to help train killer whales in captivity. He'd found it back then. Now I was starving and thinking, “Geez, how do you know anything about this?”\nWhat I found with Carmelo in a tank next to my mother's house was three puppies floating lifeless lifelessly in the water. Our little town suddenly seemed like Miami Beach, Florida. I probably wouldn't be alive to hear that, but Carmelo was nice enough to come right over to our house after we bought the page from our mother's sister. He really saw for himself, too, and if only he'd seen this open in the first place.\n“Is this it?” he asked.\nMy mom looked at my clothes and my weight and she thought “Of course, just know right away!”\n""]"

301,IRS scam costing victims $15 million,"['(CNN) — It’s been called a tax scam involving the IRS or a Hail Mary pass designed to scare large numbers of voters into helping the IRS.\nExperts say the scam that uncovered IRS officers posing as door-to-door campaign workers looking to vote, reignited the issue earlier this year with two high-profile audits of the agency.\nThe two audits turned up millions of dollars in fraudulent payments that appeared to stem from a Nov. 26 tax scam involving the Internal Revenue Service targeting nonprofits and religious organizations. The IRS says people affected likely won’t find out anything out of the ordinary in the future.\nUnsuspecting voters are prone to repeat these stories once they learn of the scams, but make no mistake about the bad practice.\n“People are absolutely fearful of doing something like this,” said Bob Shepherd, a consultant for the accounting and consulting firm Public Employees for Government Reform. “They have the option of bouncing a refund and then go to the IRS. … It’s not like all these recent stories about the IRS turn out to be true.”\nThose who are more than happy to use tax preparation software like Microsoft TaxPortal and TurboTax, can check the verification and charge.\n“Typically, if you click on ‘Get prepared now’ on your personal account as an easy way to shop and complete your taxes, you’ll then be able to engage in tax work without paying any taxes,” said Shepard.\nThrifts, chaos\nPayroll fraud and giving Congress a helping hand are illegal in the United States and IRS officials’ reluctance to figure out how to begin providing refunds to affected people is frustrating.\nInternal Revenue Service employees have been working overtime in the field not knowing if they will be accepted in the first place, said Al Smith, an IRS spokesman.\n“One possibility is that in the event that a certain group of people have contacted the IRS, we will write a letter at that time to ask them to take matters into their own hands,” Smith said.\nTaxpayers are split between taxpayers who act on advance claims, rather than taking the personal actions needed to file for an IRS filing.\n“A majority of the complaint files are false,” said David Leipold, IRS deputy commissioner for commercial operations.\nA sense of confusion about IRS refunds may be a major problem. And trust is at a premium for taxpayers who help prepare their taxes.\n“People need to realize they won’t get a refund if they didn’t do it right,” said Linda Braga-Scafier, a tax counselor who oversees all forms of money management for a Chicago-based company that has four Federal Employees for Government Reform.\nTaxpayers beware\n“The IRS can always tell you if you’re a trustworthy person, but they’re not going to let you take matters into your own hands,” said Richard Schonfeld, a business development professional who helped develop the Allocate Tax Donation Fund.\nThe funds are used to help restore the finances of U.S. hospitals in countries around the world, as well as a U.S. hospital in need of building repairs and payments on its former hospital property.\n“If it’s multiple people of various ethnicities who have contributions to go toward that hospital, which is this in the U.S., or it’s multiple localities, the odds of going bankrupt go up enormously,” Schonfeld said.\nAnd IRS delays that, Schonfeld said, may force them to rely on fraud experts with advice about using information from the Internet for their intended tax return or passover.\n“You don’t want to rush into someone else’s account. One of the ways you can do that is to get a tax form filled out, submit it online and process it,” Schonfeld said.\nBe prepared\nUrgent calls to the IRS help are being dropped from hundreds of different calling centers this week, the IRS said.\n']"

""I thought, \'I don\'t even know what this is, I know that I\'m a 13-year-old woman.\'""\nFor McNeill, there was a time when she was ""knowing that I would never be able to start the school when I was a little girl.""\nIt was then, the newspaper she went to was often filled with similar writing.\nNewly, the letters began growing in popularity in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Ohio as time passed by and the girl stayed with home school.\nAn aspiring computer programmer, McNeill became distracted at school because her mother not only looked after her, but cared for her as well.\n""For the first three months I did what she did for me,"" McNeill says. ""I could never walk. I could never run. I could not do anything, and I wasn\'t able to do anything. But I was able to stay in school, go to first grade, and hope nothing bad happened.""\nDespite her progress, McNeill and her husband hadn\'t been able to raise enough money for their second-grade classroom. They were starting out by giving gifts to the poor, too, so it turned out they were always getting mail after the holidays.\n""I didn\'t know if it would be anything else, but it was just something like sending Christmas cards and wrapping paper,"" McNeill says. ""I was so aware of the mail before I ever started that I even checked the mailbox when I picked up the mail, and it started to indicate, \'I don\'t care where my mail is.\'""\nThen, in 2009, there was just enough money that McNeill stopped counting. Not only was she nowhere near enough money to cover rent or food, she had to write a check to the church or buy gift cards and credit cards.\nSuddenly, there was enough to feed the family. And she found her own meaning as well, in the phrase ""On the road to greatness.""\n""I believe in something other than being good at what you do, even though you probably weren\'t good at it,"" McNeill says. ""I believe in this environment where you don\'t put everything on hold for reason, but you still continue to push for things that are good for you.""\nFor McNeill, the closest to the beginning of school was signing the letter ""The Good Schools for Your K.""\nNow, more than 50 years later, there\'s an online community online.

There were state agencies doing “scourging” and commissioning projects worth billions of dollars.\nIt also gave tax-payers a way to keep their taxes.\nNowadays, state agencies and corporations report disclosure and also on a regular basis, or only once a year. But that might not be enough to give your family credit.\nThe push to impose taxes is up to you and your legislators.\nThe California Chamber of Commerce is pushing for mandatory sales tax, which it said would give the Legislature only one tool to regulate corporations and a third to tout that way.\nThe bill, AB401, was approved by the Senate 28-14 earlier this year, while the Assembly 63-31, is just this week that a companion bill (SB 418) is pending in the Senate.\nKudos to both parties in both houses for passing such bills, though one needs to be careful out there.

305,The truth about the white working class,"['By Natalia Reyes and Kate Gavin\nWe are under the gun to demonstrate at the Beijing Olympic Closing Ceremony how the so-called white working class has been linked to a significant influence on politics. After all, the WH has always been the campaign to give the elite a voice in the debate of American politics. And to do this in a predominately white race that has historically been resistant to promoting its own voice, has come across as an encouraging project of corporate America.\nIt does not make a difference how this so-called “white working class” has come to be portrayed to the nation.\nThe white working class that we have been talking about for years is largely composed of white progressives whose battle to oppose the Tea Party (in the large cities, what many call the “mockery of America”) was perceived to be as a rejection of white middle-class middle-class voting patterns, labor quotas, and small business policies. As such, these were the foundations of the Tea Party insurgency, but not because the party had now turned off traditional voting patterns.\nBut the problem in this economic climate has to do with its increasingly small states, because like the land of the open road in California, they have few commercial landowners or jobs available to provide for their populations.\nThree small states — Arizona, Colorado, and Nevada — now have such huge middle-class populations. They are the most populous of the large states, and the fourth-largest in the nation. At approximately 14 million, these states are roughly 16% of the nation’s population, if you include a very small population of Hispanics.\nBut while the white working class stands shoulder to shoulder with these states, it is the massive concentration of white racial elites, from the Reagan-like “Top of the Hill” era, along with their small and medium-sized majority black/Latino population, that are claiming power to Western capitalist nations, while the lone white working class is becoming a menace to American capitalist democracy. They do so using socialized medicine, and the price of their natural resources is higher-income jobs and a national debt which has been swollen by white wealth.\nThe point of this country, at least insofar as it is involved in this nation’s economy, is not that its interests should prevail over the interests of whites. What concerns it in this decision was that the most directly affected and affected by the #MeToo movement, under the auspices of the Republican party in America, is a perception by white liberals of societal evil, i.e., a recognition that the culture and ways that facilitated systemic racism have not been challenged; and it is completely unacceptable for people, who are considered irrelevant and insignificant in the lives of white people, to be denied the same equal rights as everyone else.\nIt is understandable that many whites are waiting, and, in many cases, willing, and able to respond, if victims of sexual abuse by their employers, lies and teachings on the internet, and one thing they can expect is justice, but there are no excuses for past injustices and reprehensible practices, or the ugliness of political discourse. But racism, in a pluralistic society like ours, takes on extraordinary levels, and is totally out of touch with the American way of living.\nWe can go on to prove beyond doubt that the ancient guilt at the original white working class, through the misrepresentation of its culture and beliefs, is capable of reinventing itself in a healthy manner to meet the local needs of its population. The philosophy of Wallace R. Perkins — “Have one law. But have two.” — can help usher in this new age. Our collective culture, and the economy, is finding itself in the midst of something more significant.\n']"
306,2016: Last call for working class whites?,"['By Taylor Fergusson and Nevin Burns.CNN\nNew York, April 3 (CNN) - President Donald Trump should use the January Republican legislative session as a springboard to roll back the political setbacks that have derailed the nation\'s economically diverse communities, they say.\nThat\'s the view of former Trump adviser Stuart Stevens.\n""Ladies and gentlemen: Republicans in the Congress still have about as many women and minorities as most Republican governors in the nation\'s capital,"" Stevens wrote in a response to the president, released by the Republican National Committee.\n""Today, it is incumbent upon our Congressmen in both parties to pass the House and Senate legislation that will strengthen and modernize our economy and empower millions of Americans across the country.\n""The very meaning of ""I am therefore the Republican nominee"" is being lost because the Republican Party finally coalesced around its theme of pro-life values,"" he added.\nStevens helped organize a campaign committee in 2014 to oppose the GOP\'s assault on abortion rights.\nCongress has since withdrawn bipartisan legislative efforts on reproductive health and family services.\nIf Trump is winning new elections, the administration may be setting the stage for election campaigns as well.\n""We may have the best positioned Republican Party in the nation at each election,"" said RNC member Richard Tisei, president of the National Organization for Women.\nWith one of the strongest federal records in Senate history, the Republican senators have one of the few Senate records that include female senators.\n""The notion that they\'d be able to say, \'We\'re not Democrats, we\'re not going to compete with any of the other party\'s policies and messaging was unacceptable,\' are things that I believe were out of line,"" Tisei said.\nThe GOP holds 60 of the 114 U.S. Senate seats. Democrats hold all of the remaining 38.\nTrump has waged a national campaign, expanding his national reach into the three states where he won in 2016. The president has taken to Twitter to discredit Democrats, calling them ""corrupt"" and ""a disgrace.""\nIn December, he paid a visit to former Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, who led Georgia when the nation\'s youngest governor was killed by a bullet in 2017. Deal, who was the Republican nominee for governor, said he does not support banning abortion or universal pre-K.\nAs Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry won Oklahoma in 2016, Trump did the same with Texas after his state repealed its abortion ban.\nIn a conservative state, most Republicans dismiss these political setbacks as an admission of defeat. Republican Reps. Steve King and Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, two Republicans facing retirements in next year\'s elections, still call Trump\'s message that women and minorities ""political"" and ""sanctioned birth control"" an attack on the wealthy.\nThere are concerns in Georgia over the election of Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier, who is due to face a competitive primary next year in an area that is predominantly red.\nSpeier did not immediately respond to CNN\'s request for comment.\nA Bannon ally, U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson of Georgia said that she and Washington D.C. Rep. John Lewis III, who the congressman represents, would not likely seek re-election this year.\n']"
307,White working-class evangelicals: Christian values are under attack,"['Dayna Kerschner poses for a portrait in front of one of her TV set-top boxes outside her home in Alexandria, Virginia, U.S., January 24, 2019. Picture taken January 24, 2019. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\nWASHINGTON (CNN) - America is facing major new attacks from Trump and his followers on religious liberty and on the sanctity of marriage.\nAmong those attacks is an attack on religious freedom, according to a new report by the Pew Research Center.\nThe report makes a clear theme about what divides the country: a view of freedom being infringed on by the U.S. Constitution, in which some conservatives use religion to justify discrimination. It also says that values of honor, responsibility and decency and a belief in the sanctity of marriage often hide in the framework of religious freedom or contradict their other purposes.\n""When it comes to the practical issues of race, housing, identity, sexual identity, sexual orientation and sexual orientation, those concerns loom large in areas as diverse as immigration, safety, property rights, job protection, preserving educational opportunities and defending social security,"" according to the report.\nThe survey was conducted Feb. 4-8 among 2,017 adults nationwide, aged 18 to 64. The margin of error for the survey is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.\nThe report reveals a divide among evangelicals, a GOP demographic whose core vote lines up strongly with Trump and Evangelicals, where these groups account for 41% of GOP support.\nThe survey had an immediate impact: Since 1980, when polls first began tracking the gender identity and sexual orientation of American women, the prevalence of sexual orientation at a young age among evangelicals has risen dramatically. This pattern shows just how deep the divide is between Republican evangelicals who are committed to God\'s message and those who are disturbed by it. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.\n""So what is this shift into behavior that is seen across all of the groups? More distrustful of the political process,"" said Nikole Wright, associate director of the Pew Research Center\'s Center for the Study of Faith in America. ""And also one of the consequences of that so-called \'disinformation"" in this polarized culture is a fear of disagreeing with Donald Trump.""\nRoughly six out of every 10 evangelicals feel the same way as Trump about faith and democracy.\nIn a two-way conversation, 77% of Republicans and 85% of Democrats agree with Trump on the economy, according to the survey. Less than two-thirds of Republican voters see the economy as negative.\nThe Pew Research Center report explores areas of the public\'s concern about religious liberty, funding the health care system, defending social safety net and personal freedom.\nThe report also interviews experts in religious liberty and civil liberties to examine options for holding public officials accountable in a variety of ways. That includes actions such as rescinding a lifting of federal support for a program that suppresses forced abortions or extending government assistance to those without health insurance. The report also explores whether the political process is driving a wedge between those who believe in God\'s message and those who are worried about religious liberty.\nIn January, the Pew research found that Trump\'s supporters viewed the concept of religious liberty as ""pretty much consistent with today\'s values in this country. But they don\'t fully understand why it\'s failing,"" Laura L. Hart, director of the Pomerantz Law School Center on Faith and Liberty, said in a statement.\n""The rest of the world has gone full-throttle in tackling religious liberty and their allies are trying to be as effective and efficient as possible. The same goes for America\'s freedom of speech. Christians have never used religion to divide us, but they did try,"" Hart said.\n']"
308,The shell-shocked white working class,"['By DAVID BURKE\nThey live in a world dominated by white Americans, home to four million black American workers and seven million white middle class workers. Young black folks, this generation, playfully plant pots, flume plants, landscape cranes, black people pick gold. Blacks never knew that white people were still patrolling the streets, prowling, groping, eating doughnuts, putting more dust in cans and those nights when loud plugs go off about Halloween. The camp was fought by men who had walked their black teams back to the streets on foot.\nStill working hard and exposing their black family to the hazards of life off the street is what distinguishes the lives of U.S. working class whites from their white American counterparts, leaving an entire generation woefully unprepared to help their grandmothers fight for financial independence, to whom their black community might have been so unprepared to help them deal with the serious life aspects of having to live as breadwinners without the necessary shelter and aid they need.\nTake, for example, Julia Wolfe, a 28-year-old actress and musician who was introduced to working-class roots by her grandmother, Anne, who shared a farm in Long Island, N.Y. You get the idea. As a five-year-old and single adult, Julia pulled herself together, married, lost her dad, went to college, worked her food budget, had time off to meet new people. By the time her mom died two years ago, her father’s job was gone and she’d left the farm, which earned her a paycheck from collecting signs and painting white white homes.\nAt age five, she started working as a waitress at St. Mary’s Church in Long Island City, a small establishment that operated independently, but it wasn’t at St. Joseph’s in Cutchogue that her grandmother, aunt and uncle were back. In that time, she forged a lifelong friendship with Anne. Anne lived in Long Island City long before her relatives, although she eventually moved to Central Islip, N.Y., for good.\nThen at age 12, Julia bumped into Anne, who lived only about 15 miles from the community’s power plant. Anne had established a wood-fired stove, filling the stove with homemade buttermilk pancakes and bottled orange juice to use as longcakes. They had many life lessons. In the moment, Anne would put a golf club in the front seat and hand the kids a golf ball by a C. J. Quinn approach a speeding car. When the driver jumped out of the vehicle, Anne would casually slip the golf club under the seat of the car and catch them moving quickly.\nAfter the tragedy of June 22, 1856, the family moved to Boston. Her father, Pierre, died on September 14, a few months after her mother, Lyphilds, had become pregnant with him. Shortly after, Julia offered her advice to Jacques, then 14, her younger cousin. Jacques decided to grow American—his birthing tradition since he was a child was born in 1907—and so Julia cooked sandwiches, homemade baked goods and used other relatives as a spare-for-school babysitter. Jacques was a tough guy, though those opinions did not sit well with her parents, as was Julia’s viewpoint. Her parents moved to New York to be closer to her grandparents, who were ultimately away.\nWhen, in February, Julia and Jacques went swimming with their son Jacques, her grandmother, Martiney, left for Boston. She was arrested for demanding a parking ticket from a man with two overdue marijuana warrants, citing identity theft, then helped police recover her purse. Julia, who had long argued that the reports of the theft were not false, kept her account up until an ambulance arrived in Boston later that night and paid the ticket. She then had a flight back to L.A. and booked another visit to New York to see a celebrity chef and possibly her doctor, and enrolled in the fall program at prestigious Columbia University’s Graduate School of Business.\nWhen she returned to L.A., in fall 2015, Martiney quickly lent her son a coat. In the summer, Julia took him to a local sports league tournament to go fishing. The exhibition of cartoon character Snoopy might also be heralded by blacks at a time when little kids have four times as many options on one deck as white kids. Yet Julia never wanted that gift. In an age of racial divide, it would be nice to see a toddler like her.\n']"
309,West Virginia's 'forgotten tribe'; why the white working class feels left behind,"['There is plenty of talk about people who live in the ""forgotten tribe"" from the centuries-old notion that the white working class ""offers the welfare of the majority of those in the country."" Is there a working class problem with these conversations?\nAt an intersection of local historical monuments, e-mail lines and e-verification devices, black homes with Old West painted exterior doors and farmsteads with farmhouse, spotted trees and caravans, mules and cattle roam the West. When and how we try to tell the story are left to history. To get it right, we need a bit of archaeology and a bit of optimism. We need a bit of hope.\nA walking tour of the abandoned rural villages below the cow stands is one way to understand the action here. It was not long ago that not a stone was left to hiss on Old West cattle trade sites. The valley is where there once were several hundred millisieverts running around the Conrail Railway named \'The Can Farm\' that connected hermits and colonists.\nOld West cattle traded journey back and forth for generations, from the farmhouse to the railroad. Finding the spot where one of your own grandmother smoked a delicious El Chapo cigar at a tourist dinner before heading to work, reading his diary and planning an escape can be the most rewarding part of the journey.\nThe trip would not be complete without a visit to West Virginia. For a first, we would fly over Mount Airy National Monument from Jefferson Barracks, at the pay $55 per person, and settle at the ""P.O. Box"" located at 2806 Cambridge Pike. The nearest stop is at Chicopee State Park, at 210 N. Main St.\nJohn\'s suggestion would be a wireless transmitter that soaks in foliage and provides dry, textured soil for tots to hoe along. The transmitter would also use chemicals to produce harsh air for the white working class, and utilize both EMTs and army medical teams.\nOne main problem is that those working hard are not seen through mountains. The lack of treatment for treating injuries and limited treatment for white working class diseases has been a source of contention for years, but one solution is born of individual projects. For instance, Governor Tommy Thompson\'s private WV White & Sons private-based job training company is helping white working class families through more than 150 construction and painting jobs.\nWV Red and War of 1812 buildings in the town run by high-management M.D. Duke and ""old black"" missionaries run on bare-bones wooden floors and candle poles and canopies. The Civil War was even fought with antique equipment that could never fit under a brick wall. In 1808, Brone Brothers Company erected a Mount Rushmore monument on much of Jamestown after sending students out to show how to build upon their home base. The place was still home to part of the rural Colorado Descendants that also helped put West Virginia on the map.\nOur tour arrived late and faded from memory, but we\'d seen many different things to where these really first came from. A locomotive and wagon rumbling down the steep hillside called the Conrail route. As an old WV information server that was made up of often-troubled local archival materials, its destruction created an instant reputation for blight, where credit cards and insurance were stolen or driven out of use.\nVoila! The wrong idea of leaving rural America has long since been forgotten. The remaining useful remnants of power, administration and the easy access of commerce have helped turn back the power of the white working class.\nConrail was built to link remote communities by rail, and it remains in service today. However, we can\'t leave things like the barns and houses that lie vacant now, or the uninvited pickup trucks and pick-up trucks whose inhabitants ride the rails and drive away from the town center. To prevent a return to all-white supremacy we must properly evaluate what was done when the efforts of our heroic settlers to exterminate the working class were finally met with the aid of the men and women in black and white shirts.\nThe process is brutal. Growing young and young men slip into militias and join forces with fellow laborers who encourage white working class politics. Our schoolchildren and our brave last few years, especially veterans and their fathers, come to a shocking conclusion: We\'re not going to bring the past home to those who fought to free it from the grip of centuries-old bigotry.\nHowever, in the very near future, no one can pretend that West Virginia is no more for workless farmers than it was the 1850s. Until we put people\'s lives']"

Even among whites, 57 percent of Hispanics said immigrants contributed to a modern-day society, compared to just 40 percent who said they contributed to a modern-day society.\nRegarding personal views on immigration, just 13 percent of Americans said they felt some degree of effect on their personal lives, compared to 71 percent who felt an effect on their overall life.\nEven among people with a high school diploma, 45 percent said immigrants changed their lives, compared to 51 percent who said so.\nTrying to achieve a satisfactory living standard for Americans in all social and economic categories could be just as hard for immigrants as for white Americans. Fewer than a third of whites say their personal lives improved within five years, compared to 80 percent of whites.\n""]"

Others have kept up with the Trump era, is labeling the tax cuts, and wanting to reopen all government entitlement programs, as extensions.\n“Trumpism casts new economic and political danger on the unfortunate populations that have reached retirement age,” said Sarah Sables, policy lead of the Research Group at the Brookings Institution, in a statement.\nAccording to the study, 2 million Americans by 2020 will not receive universal health coverage.

I want to hear what a hard-headed conservative thinks. As for myself, if Trump was truly crazy, he would have passed up all the VP picks in 2000 or '01, and instead got Bob Dole and John McCain. Sure, McCain was a crazy choice, because he was at war with China and the Iraq war, but we have a president with crazy ideas who just barely survives this election.\nI’m not sure what he thinks he should do. Is he crazy or just reflective of reality? Is Trump out of his depth? What do we do about fear? Shouldn’t he learn that the way we handle those of us who are in his orbit is to be smarter and more humane and ask these questions?\nI think he understands that there’s a fundamental conflict, and he understands that by being like him we are much too arrogant and too stupid to care about anything else. He understands that leadership is not about jonesing for power, but what you have to understand is that the ascendancy of the ascendant leadership rests entirely with the electeds.\nYou’ve lost a lot, right? Is it me? I’m putting my trust in you, but I am starting to think the power shift may be a rather bold—and necessary—growth path, and you should use your leaders wisely.\nYou have led the charge to improve this country and of course you have been tirelessly kind and benevolent toward the Obama people. But let’s not blame Obama for everything that hasn’t worked out. He was an actual, good president and my all time favorite Republican presidential candidate had a crisis moment where he choked on turkey. And that can happen in this country. He would be so proud to see his legacy here, and take a shot at what it took him to have this country built, and to really give it a new lease on life.\nAnd let’s get your guns out. Now? I won’t blame this president for the state of politics when it comes to misogyny, but it’s outrageous that they used this opportunity to impose a rigged system. I will say this: I’m glad that most of the accusations are dismissed as disproven. But remember that this country has never been challenged by a strong leader and may never be challenged when it comes to sexism, racism and the like.\nEven if we ignore how Trump’s problems have come to symbolize how we’ve been rocked by a president whose politics create a confusing juxtaposition that he doesn’t understand as much as we either think he does.\nI don’t say that because of the qualities that make me want to kill it. He was born to a black mother and white father. I don’t claim he learned all that from the experience. He’s a genius. People just don’t make them. But I will say the fact that he’s described as being like a monkey on his way into being president again is actually a testament to his unique brilliance.\n""]"

Yet people are greedy, and they worry that what I earned was nothing less than a military education, largely rooted in the industrial revolution that ended the civil rights era. And people are afraid of the free enterprise economy.\nThis is not the glory days of Che Guevara or those pines that romp high over this recent frosty weather. These are the days of Americans achieving more relative dignity than the Nazis. There is a hideous value to this downward descent in the kind of ingenuity that eases the time between the time of Buddha and the age of the T-shirt. So far, the problem has been Obama’s white-collar economy.\nI was driving home from work about 9:30 a.m. and found my dog in my car, a tent of the sort I build in our desert home town of rural Wyoming, without the Internet, because I’m trying to work that day.

It was called DecemberFest and it was now in its final week. I had only a few patrons, besides movers and shakers, enough to cover the days between New York Times Day in Wausau, Wis., and White House Correspondents Dinner in Washington, D.C. And enough to be an architectural gem of the town where grizzled, raven-faced, clunking sculptors mill and erect other marvels on the banks.\nSen. John McCain’s unwelcoming New Hampshire Primary had occasion to set a new example, one that could make Texas seem home. In every state, at least, most people in oil, coal and gas fields received some kind of free news service while watching oil companies slash capital costs. It is a polite, finely calibrated gesture to elevate a state that, for decades, had been considered the envy of the world.\nBut today, the makings for a comeback are quite different. Those in the oil industry are for sure coming out pretty badly. And the liberal media and lawmakers who have moved toward new, inclusive ways of doing business now favor me too. The rabid liberal bloggers are leading a charade on the economy, and Democrats are losing ground to Republicans.\nThe revival of the free-market economy is a violation of the American spirit. According to Gallup, despite the late-1960s bankruptcies of a dozen major steel companies, the economy didn’t shrink until 1970. After 1973, the economy was growing 5.5 percent a year.\nThe landmass above Washington DC was cleaned up, boondocks were hauled, and something dramatic happened.

They believe that governments give more value to people’s money than to their hard-earned security. They want a massive government welfare state that serves only the few. A new populist president needs to appoint economists who will rediscover the free-market idea that favors our talented, educated people at the expense of how much we actually work.\nGone, for a time.

The government also said one person was killed in the fighting.\nThe Kurdish governor said Iraqi forces in Abar are now concentrated on the province and are dealing with more than 160,000 people, many of them displaced or involved in mass cross-border border attacks.\n""Thousands are still still displaced and this is not an example,"" he said. ""They are working hard.""\nOne last milestone has taken place since advances began last month in Abar.\nISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared the ISIS caliphate in all of Iraq and Syria in June 2014. The jihadists have seized parts of Iraq and neighboring Syria, and have called for a new offensive to retake more territory.\nRushing into the cities where the fighters had staked their claim last week, the operation is seen as the major piece of the challenge for the Kurds in their fight to take back Anbar, a city that once held Baghdad\'s city limits. Kurdish leaders say the capture of Anbar will help them expand their territory across Syria.\n""It is not only Kurdish fighters. It is also eastern, predominantly Kurdish people who the regime and others who command responsibility for their own cities and territories, what they do and how they do it, how they maintain their independence and that will be critical,"" said a Kurdish Kurdish official, quoted by CNN.\nThere is also an effort by different factions to break up the city and control further territory.\nThe battle for Anbar has involved security coordination and an apparent exchange of fire, with around 70 per cent of the city settled before the governor from Anbar gave up control last month.\nSince the offensive began on April 1, Kurdish forces have killed 5,000 fighters in Anbar -- a record number. They have besieged a senior officer in Mosul on their side. They are now trying to retake the provincial capital Mosul.\n""We don\'t know how these side clashes work. If the situation continues what happens will just be a very bloody situation,"" said a Kurdish official.\nIraqi forces announced on Saturday that Anbar had captured three villages in the town of Apkan, making it the first Syrian province to fall.\nThat day, Kurdish security forces moved into villages outside Apkan, about 140 miles from Baghdad.\n']"
317,Drug addiction: There is help,"['The road to recovery is particularly daunting for a patient who is intent on being violent, because everybody has a story to tell.\nViolence is overwhelming and can make the feeling of helplessness disappear. Fines and jail sentences can force a patient to wander away. Abuse can be treated, with no doubt, without resorting to force — not even a harsher sentencing. The sentence is simply too severe. How difficult is that? Fines and prison time are the lowest proportion of recoveries with substance abuse.\nEven life experience can make life unbearable. When a family has a huge influence on a substance abuser, the long-term consequences are often dire.\nNow that I am a parent, I have to step back and look in my child’s eyes. The quick and easy way to fix a child’s addiction is to give it its ear.\n(The main issue here is that, even in the most vulnerable of households, such people cannot see themselves on a much bigger scale, but where and how they can see is unclear. Too many people have strong personal biases or reason to disregard the consequences of their behavior.)\nThe most common suggestion for a child drug abuse treatment program is to keep him or her connected to an in-house treatment facility so that the relapse can be controlled.\nUnfortunately, many people find that putting someone in residential treatment won’t do enough harm.\nThat’s why I love to help other parents by persuading them to help.\n(On a recent evening, at the former Elkdale High School in New Hartford, N.J., I managed to attend an 8-month-old son who spent most of the time and money caring for this pet. He had no idea what his mother was doing when I helped him to clean up his stepfather’s car. I encouraged his mom to think about what would have happened had I not allowed him to get involved in all his social activities, even at night, before the baby’s birth.)\nI didn’t try to help the man, but I did try to keep this beautiful creature — and to show them how damaging drugs can be.\n“You’ve got some drugs, too,” my daughter, Christian, said to her dad.\nI reminded her, “You don’t have a gun. How do you keep a gun? That’s what you’ve got to do for yourself.”\n“There aren’t any guns,” my child responded.\n“You have a .22?” I told her.\n“You don’t have a .22,” Christian started asking. “Why? Why did you do it?”\nTo Christian’s relief, Christian nodded, the cop smiled and gave him a recommendation that he should leave the meth habit.\nSoon after, our son returned home and me proceeded to drive him home to his father’s home in exchange for a recommendation that he abandon his abuse.\nThe kid looked remarkably distraught. I asked if my job was in saving this kid’s life.\n“If it makes me happy,” I said.\n“No,” he replied. “It makes me feel worthless.”\n']"

She then came into the public eye before being appointed the Teacher at the First Corinthian Schools in Corvallis, Oregon.\nIn January 2003, Janis Cetrini married the former Walt Burger in a ceremony attended by “a lot of realakers.”\nAs of 2005 she lived with the couple in a private apartment in the city of South Bend, Indiana, for six weeks, before eventually moving back to Bend.\nOn April 13, 2006, she and her partner were attacked by Christopher Taneo at what would be their last “gift exchange.”\nThe victim pulled the knot in the fall of 2006 as Janis walked the mile in her boat, then jumped in and helped Jeff Sawyer, a fellow student who was kicking out the fake needle.\n“We celebrated the occasion in a massive ceremony and, because I’m happy and grateful, we ended up getting a boat ride that would be better for our relationship,” Janis Cetrini said on Facebook.\nShe also got a night off from public school in the summer of 2007 and moved to the school year of 2008.\nIn the past three years, “I’ve really enjoyed my job,” Janis Cetrini said.\n“It’s never been done before.”\nAll in the family\nJanis Cetrini has been with family since her second marriage to Robert W. Burger in 2007. Her sons Alex, 23, and Anthony, 12, all attended college and have now earned business degrees.\nPrior to that, Janis Cetrini was the dressmaker for ""Masa\'s Dream"" musical show, where she starred in a production of the show in 2007.\nOn Friday, Janis Cetrini’s youngest son Jocelyn, 16, won the Gloucester County Spelling Bee for the eighth time at a local spelling bee in Boston.

I was adamant about not smashing my toddler's head against the wall of the West Wing while typing.\nMy husband and I were seated on the West Wing and I was about to blow myself up and am about to miss my honeymoon and friend's destination, she was in the middle of an upstate high school assembly meeting with little to no money left to pay for dinner.\nSo much travel has preceded our honeymoon, that I found myself trying not to look so gross, staring out the window at the magnificent view from the Capitol that didn't seem so remote after a recent trip to Washington, D.C.\nAll it took was one hundred miles to reach my brother in captivity at the Capitol. With less than 50 miles to travel, I had saved up some cash and set my expectations on nothing but the life we had known.\nWe were headed to Washington for the U.S. Conference of Mayors' conference, which took place in May of 2005 in Philadelphia. Together we were promised beautiful destination. We had arrived in DC, met this guy our dad was planning to marry, and sent off on a whirlwind trip to Pyongyang to raise our three children. We took our passport to Pyongyang but to the horror of our parents everywhere we went - i.e., thousands of miles and four years back - our travel documents were sent back to our old lands.\nA Foreign Desk, our back door was fenced in, and we headed to North Korea - where we were sure our sanity, our father's, our mothers', our much younger sister's and my husband's unconditional adoration would be greatly improved. We celebrated our one year anniversary with Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump in that same year.\nSince those events, I have thought a lot about other places besides the U.S. and what it meant to be raised in a place that I have never seen on earth.\nI know it would be hurtful to let people know that you are from a more powerful country with more people, but it's not the only thing that defines us all. I remember the smiles and the tears we'd hear about the Iraq war and the steady stream of people who were shocked by what we had just been taught about their country.\nWhen I think back to the one campgrounds that never open the rest of my life and whenever I go home to get work done, maybe I'll be referring to the staff in my own back yard. Maybe I'll be referring to myself for a second having forgotten what it felt like to live in a country without a desert who, as bad as it was, lived happily ever after. Maybe it's what I learned in Germany that altered me just a bit.\nBut for the most part, it's not going to be enough for me to trust and love my country anymore. There will always be people who will always believe I made the right decision.\nA daily blog covering topics such as education, sexuality, equality, the minimum wage, how far we are from actual healthcare and the movement for global women's rights has struck me as the closest I have been to a country from Russia without human rights violations.\nPeople in my country are still afraid of anything even close to the norms, laws, and culture that they were taught to be expected to live by. But when I hear stories of some of those institutions not having the freedoms or privilege they feel free to apply, I want them to stand up and say: we love you, but maybe we're wrong about something?\n""]"

322,Sex trafficking survivor who wants to end 'The Game',"['SOUNDERVAGE, Conn. (CNN) — Amanda Kaschitz of Maine is a survivor of human trafficking and may be one of the few victims alive.\nKaschitz entered the world of prostitution in 2002, selling people through her coke room. The 31-year-old has had many jobs over the years and has overcome great adversity, including having mental health issues.\nKaschitz is used to finding a place to live. Her owner pimps her about her name. That’s how she learned about anti-trafficking advocates but never told her customers.\nWhen Kaschitz’s boyfriend is called for help, they ask if Kaschitz has some spare cash to buy her. She agrees but gets a long wait.\n“I’m like, they don’t have anything to do with the owner. She doesn’t have the money for anything,” she told CNN affiliate LBT.\nMNT spoke with Kaschitz for this story about being on a boat that approached Maine on a recent day. At the bottom of the water, Kaschitz said she was followed as she ran into her friend’s motel. She said she and her friends picked him up at the bottom and brought him inside.\nKaschitz was a little surprised that Kaschitz didn’t call her, knowing she just happened to be on a boat with someone she knew. But she said that she knew the other gang members who ran away after having a conversation with Kaschitz.\n“It was very exciting and real because I thought they were friends. They were real,” Kaschitz said.\nKaschitz said she believed there was someone on the boat, but did not know what kind of friend the other gang members had. Kaschitz said the two of them were the one pimps would call to get Kaschitz into their safe place.\nOn Thursday, Kaschitz was getting ready to leave Maine when she stopped by a friend’s house in northeast England. Kaschitz stopped, saw the man and then let him go.\n“I think he was the last one at the house, so I knew the whole situation was right by my name,” Kaschitz said.\nKaschitz said the man left and Kaschitz began asking if she wanted more. Kaschitz was skeptical but decided to trust the man.\n“I thought, ‘Oh, that was great,’” Kaschitz said.\nThe victim said she was unsure why Kaschitz had people talking to her, but Kaschitz insisted they knew each other in Ireland. The victim said she called the man’s family. She said she believed he had the money to buy her. Kaschitz’s friends passed that information on to the other gangs. She admitted that she met the stranger over a drink a couple of times, but denied the man did anything to her.\nShe said the man threatened to pull her from the boat and had other offers. Kaschitz said that’s when she realized that she still had a desire to escape.\n“I mean I wasn’t acting like a cavewoman,” Kaschitz said. “I didn’t really expect to get back on the boat.”\nThe man once spent $8,000 on a rescue yacht and protected it from thieves and thieves’ loot. Kaschitz’s friend was willing to lend money to her but wasn’t sure whether Kaschitz would survive. Kaschitz said she was determined to find her way.\nKaschitz and a friend last year rescued an 81-year-old who was cooking with his baby as she walked home from work. The 10-month-old boy was on a German national army plane when Kaschitz arrested him.\n“I was like, ‘It’s really important,’” Kaschitz said. “I’ve got to break it, I’ve got to break it.”\n']"

He also said he would destroy ""the American Dream"" if he kept his comments a secret.\nAnd then, in December, Trump said his goal was to ""end the death tax"" paid by ""criminals and illegals"" and ""get rid of the damn Wall Wall.""\nIt\'s unclear why the right-wing organizations have been so active on the issue.\nAccording to media reports, labor rights groups have been working to secure the demolition of the gates at S&O and JCP&L stores, after it became known they were being used for the illegal immigrant labor industry in ""full and processed housing.""\nThe visit in late March was also timed to coincide with a D.C. immigration hearing on the issue.\n']"

325,Thousands forced to work on Brazil's cattle ranches,"[""Posted on By now, everyone’s bummed away about the soggy coverage coming out of Brazil’s cattle ranches after the winter — but what about long haul? That’s exactly what happened on Monday when angry people flooded the private ranchers feeding them with liquor in March’s northern Cauca state.\nSome fought the “soggy” run-up in cattle numbers, trying to pull down prices as stocks were “bouncing back” and the cattle go from getting cheap stuff — the feedlot could not turn them all “dry” — to more desperate sales. Others, however, made people laugh, exclaiming, “There’s no need for ‘soggy’ cattle.”\nWhere people in the midst of this rodeo feel that lack of survival need not be a concern, the million-dollar question arises: When will it come to letting everyone down?\nREAD MORE: 'Twilight of temperate America' kicks off more food wars\nThe solution? Companies like RT Las Carras de Cauca, which distributes cattle through the process of every slaughterhouse in Brazil, step up their prices, cutting feedlots’ required numbers from what were typically 10- to 50-ton per head to help the ranchers outbid the premium prices. RT Cauca’s prices stand at $1.05 per head per kilogram (3.5 pounds/ kg) in the northeast of the country.\nTo test that, cattle in the round, a slaughterhouse (or private ranch), will always be a good proxy for cattle to eat when cattle are busy — and it will often well overkill.\nThus far, the industry has responded by lowering feedlots’ required numbers even when cattle are required to die. These cuts will increase prices because they can accurately reflect how those slaughtered cattle eat into the feedlot. But there are many ways to raise prices because cattle are eaten, and the cattle simply are not chicken feed.\nIn 2016, farmers slashed their feedlots’ numbers and made a poor financial decision. When the rand currency did not improve in August, it drove a mass exodus in local cattle to big cities to provide cheap labour to the hogs.\nThe cattle of then-President Dilma Rousseff’s Workers’ Party (PT) came from Central America, and Central America’s biggest producer also now controls a big swathe of the country.\n“The new administration is setting the total modern world wage for the PT,” her party described its recent presidency in Brazil’s Workers’ Party media guide. Rousseff called on people to buy beef because her policies could save the economy from years of cheap prices: “Cattle stands to be a new nightmare to live with,” she said in a recent news release.\nRousseff's people’s money were tight and she badly wanted to boost exports of grains and chemicals to central Asia and the Middle East, which also produces dried grain. But things did not work out.\nBy selling scrap together few profitable parts of the process, they also bought feedlots that avoided laying hundreds of thousands of small operations to save themselves. By the end of the year, they stood to make 70% to 80% less of the $3 billion they invested.\nThe fact that cattle were so scarce doesn’t mean the issue is hopeless. When purchasing cattle is an exercise in cheap labour, people get to enjoy it — and it’s part of a good overall social and economic strategy for the post-Brazil kick-off. When it’s already a real and present problem — like the usual men and women out, rich and poor — people can work themselves back into the game.\nSluggish prices could allow the PT to avoid such problems and steer the country in the right direction.\nREAD MORE: Mexico's Cinco de Mayo tribute: Why Mexico's elites are too rich\n""]"
326,The children working in Cambodia's brick kilns,"['When Jam on the 24th round of World Snorkeling Championships opens up next month, there\'s going to be plenty of hungry young people who have no idea how to survive the 32 weeks they spend on their absolute living conditions in a brick kiln in the Cambodian capital.\nStarting April 13, walkers from around the country will try and avoid the huts. According to the Cambodian government, the resources that they use in the kilns are five times more valuable than the land they have to occupy for the day.\nThe kilns, which allow local people to leave their homes to live in harmony with the land and people, were first developed in the late 60s and early 70s, but the villages around the area have been dwindling since 1994.\nThe government estimates that around 75,000 people live in the old brick kilns with most leaving as soon as they are able to move out. The kilns provide accommodation, food and water for 400 people.\nThe kilns were originally intended to educate the public, but have since become targets for militants, according to Human Rights Watch.\nThe Cambodian government is in talks with Belfocal, a non-profit organization to train 6,000 locals to become soldiers in 2019. Belfocal is expected to give them military training, food and hygiene products.\nCP: Isn\'t war an inevitable social injustice?\nMPG: Now it\'s war, but we know that war has consequences and a war has consequences. People have lost the land, their homes are destroyed, they have children who lost a sister, who lost a dad, who lost a brother... people from many different ethnic groups and cultures and cultures living on a communal situation can sometimes have problems.\nIf you go and bring your kids, we should teach them how to educate their brothers and sisters... We have to teach them how to use drugs... We have to teach them how to abuse drugs... they have social and economic problems like this.\nCP: Wouldn\'t human trafficking be devastating?\nMPG: The last thing we want in the world is an ever large collection of people and children on a single piece of land. Cambodia is the only place on Earth where human trafficking is not a problem or a problem we have to educate our children about the dangers of it.\nCP: Isn\'t it a nightmare for anyone, especially children, who have to live with the consequences of their actions?\nMPG: There\'s not a country in the world that has not taken a lot of effort to educate its people. They don\'t know the consequences of anything. We\'re not going to let them go to the trash. The situation is so desperate, it will take a lot of planning, dealing with it ... We need to come together and allow the right people to come in and help these children learn, who maybe could possibly be better at education.""\nCP: What are you hoping to do with the money that you\'ve invested into the projects?\nMPG: We definitely need to go back to the old bricks, but even that money can be used to learn how to construct a new brick kiln.\nCP: How do you plan to accomplish these programs and programs?\nMPG: We\'re going to build bricks factories. We\'re going to build brick factories in our area. We\'re going to create these are the full access to the natural resources of Cambodia to build here.\nCP: Will technology be part of your projects?\nMPG: Not necessarily. We\'re going to give them tools and to connect to people to help them connect with a bigger voice.\nCP: Are the eight kilns getting as much attention in terms of the official effort?\nMPG: I don\'t know if that\'s the case. The reality is that when we travel as many countries and places as are right now, what we do is something that if you don\'t bring it in, if you don\'t understand the work that\'s needed to provide a modern life for people, it hurts you. So we\'re going to do that and we\'re going to bring them in.\nCP: Are you planning anything major for 2019?\nMPG: We\'ll plan to do big things this year and they will start like this. But when the money runs out, we\'ll depend on the word from the government. Our biggest priority is with the children and the village, and we\'re going to take it from there.\n']"

The sisters go to a website that offers opportunities for girls to find out what is happening and how to protect themselves.\nSome of the girls may move out, but if the girls don\'t they will be drawn back to family in the future and led to a family. Those sisters realize that the children go through so much of the process, and they need people with their lives to assist them in navigating this all-important process. The website allows girls to identify themselves to the therapist and how to express their feelings and in turn inform them about what to do in a situation where they feel uncomfortable or excluded or unwelcome. One of the most surprising things about the therapy is that the girls don\'t have to worry about whether they need guidance from others.

328,City of Tomorrow,"[""You likely have never heard of City of Tomorrow, because the Amazon-owned automaker is a public idea: one that would bring all of Canada’s municipalities under one umbrella, free from municipal government and economic meddling. The idea had largely been in the works for years, but was actually dropped out of consideration last year.\nBut one change is coming: Amazon is planning to roll out the system in communities around the country. And the first countries to implement the system would be in Spain. A week after its Paris launch, Amazon unveiled its first autonomous city in Toronto, which already boasts a number of other kinds of smart city projects.\nAmazon has been developing a system of connected cities for decades, and has long campaigned for people to create a sustainable model to operate in them. Now, it plans to develop autonomous cities and share their technology with the public.\nAs with now existing municipal systems, these cities will give cities and their mayors a “giving voice” in decisions on issues like parking, student housing, and transit. For cities like Toronto, many simply can’t afford to have to care for themselves, while making the system more efficient and competitive.\nIt’s not like there’s much of a need for technology here, but a smart city will give cities a new way to serve public services and give residents more dignity and opportunity. The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission has proposed how to define “global connected city,” and how cities should prioritize local concerns rather than individual areas of expertise.\nOfficials at each local municipality have a plan but no defined funding goals yet. Cities can waive some of their taxes on urban forms, though, which will allow them to give themselves good relations with the public.\nWith a proposed system that adds more creative choice — and the kind of innovation that City of Tomorrow will provide — these communities can start to approach the concept in a more thoughtful, flexible, and comfortable way.\nThere are a number of objections. Cities can't just serve themselves. Everyone needs to think small, and urban delivery venues are now getting a lot of funding, but building infrastructure requires more imagination, innovation, and cooperation. The challenge in Ontario has been to convince communities of how well it will work.\nBy all indications, the federal government will not support city and community-planning autonomy in the long run. But it’s a very different policy than our current finance priorities—and one that should have a much bigger impact than what’s currently moving around in cities around the country.\n""]"

It was first shared online this week, on one of the official fan pages of the Church of England.\n“Our monarch will receive her first piece of art from a dear friend outside our walls,” Queen Elizabeth wrote on the message. “Her wish is to all beautifully sum up the joy, for the people of our religion and nation, that since childhood the lives of all people have been paved with love.”\nThe precise cause of the virus that swept Britain in December is unclear, but it is thought to be related to the human papillomavirus (HPV), a disease that spreads through biting, not just coughing, contact with the skin or spreading to others.\nHIV is commonly spread in intravenous fluids, sex and rape between adults who come into contact with infected people.\nCampaign to eradicate the disease grows\nThe 2017 coronavirus pandemic in the Caribbean and around the world\nThe coronavirus was first detected in Western Europe in 1984 by a severe cold epidemic in Scotland, and has spread throughout Asia and Africa in recent years.\nThe virus is transmitted between people by infected flesh and other organisms, mainly from laboratory-confirmed virus samples, mostly rodents.\nThe virus is believed to be passed by an infective insect, provided an infected person undergoes fever, cough, runny nose, swollen glands and red-shirted urine.\nAttempts to control infection by opportunistic infections, said the World Health Organization, have failed so far.\nBritish MP and Labour leader Ruth Davidson, who chaired the parliamentary health committee’s health and social care committee, this week welcomed the work of scientists “to try to rid ourselves of the terrible disease which drenchs our nation.”\n“We desperately need to do more, particularly to educate ourselves and the wider public, and what we know about this virus is that it spreads through contaminated blood, urine and faeces. It also spreads by virus in very highly infectious disease from infected people. We need to do more to stop it and we must do it better,” she added.\nShe said the outbreak “causes a massive sense of urgency that British public health policy is desperately needed and to step up in order to keep people from spreading this disease, and the work needed by the health system around the world.”\nMeghan Markle, who is dating the Duchess of Sussex, was “deeply inspired” by the plight of the disease, she added.\n“As recently as last summer I read the messages from activists around the world urging me to protect young girls like Meghan, who could potentially become victims of this infection,” she said on Instagram.\n“I’m an activist for girls’ rights. I hope the current outbreak will help save lives from the virus.”\nBritain says quarantines between people infected with the virus will allow them “to recover” and the EU’s Animal Health Commissioner, Cecilia Malmstrom, told the BBC “to finish” the work on caring for the survivors.\n“It is in our interest to ensure we do everything we can to achieve the best outcome,” she said.\n']"

332,A trade deal with America will not compensate Britain for the loss of EU benefits,"['America may be having a tough time negotiating a trade deal with the rest of the European Union in light of the potentially devastating consequences of Brexit.\nOne of the two main sources of fear for Britain is that of the Trump administration not negotiating with the EU enough to ensure that British expats do not lose the right to remain in the EU. If the two sides make good on their pledges, it could signal what has become a mutually exclusive deal — but would undermine Britain’s good will in free trade negotiations.\nRead on\nHow Trump’s disdainful foreign policy can prepare a false tone?\nThe Trump presidency is a far cry from his early days as president, when he focused on an administration charged with challenging the status quo to placate the deeply divided Conservative Party.\nA three-day inter-agency meeting in his Bizarro Wing included the subject of the protection of the workers and the EU, the issue that could have been central to the Trump administration’s hopes.\nThe meeting came amid tough election campaigning for Republicans to succeed Trump, while the chaos that ensued included that particularly dire signal that he would approve of a tax code overhaul, well off the Trump agenda. The meeting went to zero.\nGetting to the bottom of the divergence between those who oppose the trade deal and those who oppose it, was fraught with potential public relations difficulties. The onus was placed on the Trump administration to roll back its aggressive stance on European policies.\nTrump on Tuesday began posting tweets denouncing the EU\'s free trade policy, accusing many of the countries in the region of borrowing to cover the costs of committing to trade policies of more extensive global standards that haven\'t been upheld since the Second World War.\nThe president’s effort to woo support for the trade deal — which expires at the end of November — also could signal a tilt toward globalization and an attempt to reconcile geopolitical pressures with cultural differences, said Elizabeth Gilligan, a demographer at Duke University and a former British government envoy to Europe.\nTrump noted at the beginning of the day that “the EU is inefficient at producing itself and does not perform its needs.” He later tweeted: ""I have been warned by our USA\'s trade czar and an SECOND-SECOND EU trade czar not to make very vague promises to member countries and business that they will NEVER be granted a free trade deal with the US.

334,UK courts will now livestream divorce proceedings,"['There’s hope after long and shameful battles with the law: as a result of recent rulings in the U.K., divorce proceedings will now be livestreamed on social media, the law firm that deals with divorce cases says.\nThe public use of livestreaming will be prohibited until a court has addressed the issue or a ruling is reached, the law firm Lucie Murphy says.\n“It is easy for small cases to get trolled,” Murphy said. “It’s difficult for complex issues to get resolved.”\nWeighing in on both sides of the law’s #NowThatSex scandal\nAbout 12.5 million people watched the livestream last week in England and Wales, according to figures from social media website Twitch. More than 100,000 people watched it in the U.K. — including nearly 40,000 people who downloaded a 25-track-that-of-credit-only tape of the case online, on Twitch.\nMark Collins, who is representing 59-year-old Billy Coyle in his dispute with ex-wife Sophie, said livestreaming of divorce proceedings provided an opportunity for people to make an informed decision.\n“We had the opportunity to break the taboo of the male and female splits and get justice for others who are less fortunate,” Collins said. “The reason why divorce proceedings can be relatively unsound is because people generally don’t believe in divorce.”\nCollins said lots of women’s and men’s customers watched the video, a rare selling point for online video-sharing sites such as Twitch.\nMurphy said that although some people watching a video of divorce proceedings could potentially be recorded on their phones, it is an opportunity to change the way they approach matters.\n“It’s such a taboo subject,” Murphy said. “Often, divorce litigation can’t be broadcast so that conversation turns into publicity.”\nLegislation to regulate the livestreaming of divorce proceedings will go before the Department of Justice soon, he said.\nCareful tracking of ‘slaves’ online\nDismissing broadcasters, Collins says, is not an uncommon request in the U.K.\nSome 660 million people, on average, watched a video of divorce proceedings in 2018, he said.\nLee Stewart, who created a website for livestreaming divorce proceedings and created a video piece to help people track their videos, said it “would be nice to change the story of divorce.”\nIt’s important “to understand that (redacted) broadcasts and performance codes need to be changed so this doesn’t have to be a taboo subject,” Stewart said.\nCollins said publicizing the legal age of consent in divorce proceedings can help people get a better impression of the two sides.\n“The awkwardness of ‘spending your weekend laying on a mattress and trying to get some kind of financial return is no longer acceptable,” Murphy said. “It’s so unaccepted that some people may, in some cases, prefer to just watch one person complaining that they might not get to spend the money they wanted.”\nUnlike their counterparts in the U.S., where divorce proceedings are not commonly heard on television, Americans generally feel they are being heard, with Jones v. Martin Herce (2013) that became the United States’ first televised motion picture to take in the case.\n“Forget (France) about black women saying ‘I’m so sad that God didn’t send us to prison,’” Collins said. “I think the U.S. government is evolving its stance on issues of justice and equality.”\nThe Law Enforcement Interception Plan for the United States and Britain has produced a guiding text for the use of livestreaming in divorce proceedings in several countries. While such services often are free to stream on Facebook, Twitch host Erin Kerr said allowing people to provide feedback to publicists, lawyers, police and judges about the outcomes of the most pressing legal issues or their roles is important.\n“We need the public to be aware that this legal information and service can have a significant impact on their participation in the process,” Kerr said.\n']"

An outbreak of meningitis in Jordan has linked 20 to an outbreak in northwestern Nigeria.\nThe virus dates back to 1991, but experts say it’s only now that public health officials are exploring how it can spread around the world.\n“Clinical research is underway,” said Angela Grosch, lead scientist at the Wuchwein Institute for Global Health and Development, which works on the disease in cooperation with the private Austrian Plurademia Research Center and at the Lübeck School of Infectious Diseases in the Austrian capital of Vienna.\nThe government is investigating while the European Union is checking whether other countries can test their machines before testing people for the virus.\nBut the thing experts like Grosch agree on is that coronavirus in old science tools means the public health system is at risk.\n“Countries don’t always have the scientific abilities to manage viruses,” said Grosch. “You could have a coronavirus in people’s homes. If there’s no structure to sanitize them, people have the option of locking themselves inside a room and talking to their neighbors about what kind of help they need.”\n']"

Built using old-fashioned coal, it is now one of the largest private island plantings in the world, according to marketing at the company RMAX Insight.\nThe island is a key leader in integrating the various elements of solar energy into its power system. Everything else in the system — from power tariffs and other insulation costs to replacing old insulation — is adapted for a high-use climate, said Reginald Jaely, CEO and founder of RMAX Insight.\n“We have seen only another possibility — that these add-ons could be feasible and cost-effective,” he told CNN.\nHe said the island’s population of about 190,000, about 11,000 of whom live on Orkin communities, is similar to those in Berlin, a suburb of Washington D.C.\n“We are the newest renewable power producer in the United States.”\nSome efforts at creating high-efficiency solar arrays on the same island’s base mostly succeeded but others went nowhere, according to research by the International Energy Agency (IEA), which supports climate change targets.\nHowever, in 2016 the IEA declared that any such solar market to date will represent a significant saving on the grid when built on near zero solar energy.\nIn July, the institute released a report predicting that a lower global emissions market generated in 2020 will provide energy savings of $20 billion — on top of the net price savings generated by the industry itself.\nIn addition to powering a small island with 3,700 residents, RMAX Insight said it had partnered with the Scottish city of Glasgow to create a 100 megawatt solar photovoltaic array on the island, using a PG3PP battery instead of traditional fossil fuel.\nThe solar battery it received was derived from the company’s Finnish technology, making it the only megawatt-scale renewable energy company that is currently using recycled material in its solar-powered turbines.\n']"

He announced Sky would start stockpiling aircards next week to protect up to 18,000 Virgin Mobile users and 20,000 BT customers.\nPotts said at the time the airline was being criticised for not fully monitoring passengers to make sure they weren’t flying with a defective airline.\n“Balkan passengers and Virgin are even more likely to receive this exposure,” Potts said.\nSky and Virgin previously agreed that as many as 4,500 people could be exposed to coronavirus, which can strike anywhere during the flight, and Potts said was going to get more attention than its existing blobbering game.\n“I do think our virus should be around around so that we make sure we can manage these alerts and go about doing exactly what we need to do,” he said.\n“We’re just a range of little operators who’ve been doing a tough job. What we’re getting wrong is Virgin is getting the help it needs to handle the situation.”\nPetersen Global airlines boss, Paul Tease, was still refusing to take responsibility. He has not been seen at meetings with Virgin over its immigration policy.\n“I’ve asked my staff not to talk to Virgin about the death of a customer,” Tease said.\n“If people have had contact with our third-party lab you should be given all the necessary care and take the necessary precautions.”\nSky told CNN it would take a “relentless” response to any recent deaths.\nThe cabin crew employees who are likely to die of an exposure have not been notified and the crash is not yet seen as a direct blow to morale, the company said.\nLast July, it was thought that 200 people had died. Today the figures is 70 to 180.\nOf those, 18 people died from virus infection.\nAll of them were Spaniards, but it was also thought that 37 of them were Austrian-born.\nFor Sky, it is the sixth such first-hand confirmation. It is suing Virgin Media, the British phone company responsible for flying Virgin, for £200million.\nVirgin has already paid up. The company, which like Sky does business in most markets around the world, will be in court on May 8 to decide how much it is owed.\nIn a prepared statement Monday, Virgin said it was “committed to working with stakeholders to implement the protection we already have against risks”.\n“People also have real safety concerns, which is why we have taken a number of measures to protect our customers,” it said.\n“The response we have received to this has been very thorough. We have a robust authentication system and have a large proportion of our customers using simple code on our apps – ensuring that any consumer account will be encrypted.”\nThe company said its approach has been the most promising so far.\nThe first-hand counts seem to confirm this as Sky workers have continued to try and board up the infections – just 14 people have so far died.\n“We had an incredibly busy few months last year when we issued this ill-advised warning and today we are being treated for the deadliest of these,” Potts added.\n“These individuals are very hard to see.”\n']"

340,What 'Wolf Hall' trilogy reveals to us (opinion),"['By Victor Rizzo\nIf there\'s a book about James Andrew Wolf Hall, it\'s called The Wolf. The story about a young London playwright who recounts his own misdeeds to his family and upper middle class family—whose love (or at least, navels) play out through the narrative—is astonishing enough, but it\'s almost as rich and complex as Hamlet\'s ""The Catch,"" starring Ryan Gosling, and Gladiator\'s ""Master and Commander.""\nAnd somehow, that\'s not difficult to recognize.\nIt begins with the story of Pomeranian Kate, born with cavities where babies and mothers were able to float to birth. Her mother, Mary, an upper middle-class housewife, and her mistress, Helen, an alcoholic mother, survive the summer before Pomeranian Kate was born, and grow up to become a part of her family\'s family.\nPomeranian Kate, who initially sits next to the queen of the house, acts as a more important character in ""The Wolf"" than her mother, who is is a servant to Pomeranian Kate who lacks interest in social groups. Before Pomeranian Kate\'s birth, Mary was a pioneer in the family business, serving as Pomeranian Mama. Mary Magdalene was the wife of Scottish writer Henry VIII and he was aware that it would be a bloody war when Pomeranian Kate was born. But she has survived it, and will remain a model for younger generations of beauty.\nIt is an ""animal romance"" about an impoverished family fighting the extremes of economic and societal prosperity, as Mary Magdalene looks into the world of George and Georgina, and how wealthy Georgina would have married Elizabeth for the privilege of being the queen of the house. One of Pomeranian Kate\'s admirers, George Barris, has been hired by the queen to advise George on what a monetary and social burden to endure as the heir to George\'s throne.\nBut Pomeranian Kate is not only wetland watcher, but, one of the princes, would be an especially exciting prospect. A whole quarter of George\'s life in the house—or at least the house life during which he belongs—has not been well, and the marriage is at best tortuous. But this tells us something about Pomeranian Kate, or another struggling middle-class woman.\nThe upper middle-class women in Britain who had to fend for themselves are not just a sort of ""jockeying for position"" almost to get by or feel comfortable making money. In a cramped house and her own place of employment, Kate has to be protective of her daughter, Mary—a younger woman who is called by her own name when she eventually becomes the Queen. While Mary Magdalene looks for Mary around the castle, she has little contact with Kate—only a handful of intimate text messages.\n""What\'s inside her? [Kate] doesn\'t know, is anything at all,"" says Pomeranian Kate, as Kate tells him of her dislike for Mary. ""I can\'t handle it, because you haven\'t given me a reason to.""\nInstead, the queen is replaced with another one, which is, essentially, the mother of the house. Mary stands on the throne, and her sister, Princess Mary, is still living there. But there is a desperate feeling for a new person to get into her place. Mary thinks of herself in this new person\'s eyes and in a way, Pomeranian Kate represents her own memory of what a life took her when she was a child.\nPomeranian Kate smiles up when he tells her he\'s recovering. ""She was lost,"" he says. ""I\'m not . . . Googling. . . ."" But he has a problem with her memory, he writes, which leads to a whole column of chauvinism in front of him.\nIn the book ""The Wolf"" he tells Mary Magdalene that he gave her his vote for her too. What if she voted for a latter-day version of the old brother, Ned?\nThe plays themselves are exquisitely conducted, and keep all my favorite things to mind: ""Death in Paradise"" is Kate\'s title poem; ""The Sandwich Theme"" is a report on the short lives of Jamaican journalists who found themselves being enslaved for publication; and ""Enter the English English Wine"" isn\'t too long for a whiskey-soaked being; all are included in ""The Wolf.""\nI have to confess to being bored by reading the books, and ""The Wolf"" is not the book I want to read anymore. I would like a horror novel and a drama of Richard III. I still want to read ""The']"

347,How do you beat high-flying Liverpool? Watford's Christian Kabasele reveals all,"['This book by Niall Quinn focuses on three dominant players from a pre-season Europa League team: Mesut Ozil, Lucas Leiva and Christian Kabasele. Quinn describes them as ""two of the sport\'s heavyweight champions"" and is hard on themselves ""to come up with fundamentals and structure that will never go out of style.""\nNot just any champions! United\'s Kabasele boasts a personal record of 35 goals in 27 games for Arsenal and 22 more for German club ARSENAL, while each of those four has his own form of execution – his saves don\'t come more than 20 times a season.\nHis ability to negate the ball when he has the opportunity is an imperative for Arsenal -- although the average score in English League One is 79 (while Germany is an astonishing 22). Kabasele\'s contribution to the team\'s success, however, is so impressive it\'s become a prized asset for the man nicknamed the ""tractor boys"".\nEnglish football\'s five highest-paid players are no stranger to this, but the gathering of players chosen to represent the biggest clubs was a lengthy process. Wenger selected Ozil, who the Gunners earned last season\'s Champions League Player of the Year, with the homegrown boy himself, Edinson Cavani.\nKabasele may not have even been in the team at that stage but the seven-time European Cup winners have risen above the pack - doing so through their uncanny ability to equalise without leaving the box. For their efforts he has been taken all over the football world, from Mesut Ozil to Leeds United\'s Jurgen Klopp to France\'s Dirk Kuyt.\n""Christian Kabasele has taken three top-10 men in a couple of years to turn the world\'s best defensive duo into their country\'s biggest one-two punch,"" Quinn writes.\nIt\'s no secret that the Belgian is a master at baroque passing, with the goal machine breaking passes in as they creep over the opposition. Wenger believes players such as Kabasele and Kabasele bring the utmost respect to the business of the game and spend some time here with his players before committing themselves to either a club or country.\nThe same applies for the Argentinian duo either too well-fed for their livelihood or too badly fried up for competition. For Kabasele and Kabasele however, much to the delight of Arsenal fans, the international find allows him to truly excel at football in his spare time.\nHe\'s into his first campaign and has already doubled Arsenal\'s goal difference. Quinn suggests Arsenal\'s defending in the Premier League is a remarkable combination, with the Centre Brugge outfit recording a 4-0 win over Liverpool earlier this season, prompting the likes of manager Arsene Wenger to cheer on his star.\nGiven the hardship found in the Premier League and Champions League, the Man City head coach admits that the sheer fear of unfamiliarity with football suits him.\n""People say this all the time, but I never understood why I was dreaming of (the Champions League) until I had worked so hard. I never thought about how I\'d feel if I were anywhere in that bracket, if I didn\'t get home to Sheffield Wednesday at the top of my leagues, what would I be able to do? I never understood how much it would be to win the trophy when you\'re in a special place. It was an extraordinary feeling to get the results,” said Kabasele after the City game.\nHe is not the only Arsenal fan to this week tackle Kabasele. Luka Modric, the Spurs man, was subjected to the \'massive rivalry\' after he labelled the Gunners\' defensive frailties ""unacceptable"". He went on to say that success at the highest level will not be enough to do damage to football in England.\n""The derby is an opportunity for players not to win, not for managers. Their best will be the to win the League Cup, Champions League, so no matter how bad the league is, these guys will be winners.\n""They will sit in the mosh pit and demand a match from you. This summer they won\'t just be first in the league, but in the Champions League. Going forward we will see how bad this league is going to become, regardless of who happens to be leading the charge.\n']"

The travelers are mainly Sudanese, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.\nThe lawsuits filed by those countries over the travel ban stand pending a higher court ruling, and it is unclear when the appeals court will hear the case or whether it will grant final rulings on the travel ban.\nThe review process has been highly complicated by challenges to Trump\'s authority under the Constitution. Congress has no power to overturn the president\'s order by law.\nBut the Trump administration already had applied for expedited review under the special immigration judge mandated to weigh the president\'s options before issuing a travel ban.\nCongress granted some relief to travel to the United States by halting most class action lawsuits that had sought travel ban relief.\n']"
349,Europe travel ban: Will it be possible to sneak into the US via the UK?,"['BRUSSELS (CNN) — “Passengers might go through an airport checkpoint” to get to Europe, officials announced Friday as they set out suggestions for ways travelers are being prevented from going to the United States via the UK.\nThe European Union has traditionally closed the Atlantic Ocean to the sea to avoid disaster, but because of the countries’ divergent traditions, there have been few restrictions.\n“We have been inundated with requests from people on the United States side for what we call seasonal hassle, this problem where travellers see a terminal or a security check as they come in,” chief official Florentijn Hofmann of the Europol, the European law enforcement agency tasked with enforcing European laws, told CNN on Friday.\nHofmann added that a coordinated, local crackdown would “enhance the integration of customs and law enforcement at the borders”.\nThe EU’s Christmas holiday has generally opened days later, much like the U.S. government tries to advance its nation-wide travel agenda — only it’s not going to be as seamless.\nThree countries introduced “fake” passports to gain access to the United States via the UK in July.\nA German official in charge of sending financial and logistical goods to Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom pointed to a UK decision to abolish all fake passports as a factor that could potentially leave all citizens in the UK in violation of the trade laws.\nOnce it becomes law, the use of digital identities or digital-only passports will all disappear, he added.\nThe German government had to submit a bill for the legislation to parliament in the Netherlands following delays from politicians and EU member states.\nWhile refusing to speculate on how long that timeline might be, Hofmann hinted that a number of variations of the system might be involved.\n“We’re trying to gather more data,” he said. “There’s a big risk in this, but we’re also not going to give an estimate of the length and type of disruption, which we think would require a lot of time.”\nThere has been a small uptick in the number of UK-bound journeys by EU citizens since the UK reverted to the EU travel-ban, which has been credited by the CBI and others as a “proportionate response” to the problem.\nHowever, Hofmann warned that when the rules apply, people need to be aware that they might not be able to go to the United States because the travel document still exists on the European system.\nOnce they do, travelers will be able to enter their vehicle online, which will help ensure they’re not screened or killed.\nIf they’re not, they’ll be able to leave the car.\nThe transport minister Gerard Canete told Associated Press that the country of origin for several European ports have been suspended for checks, but the shutdown will still take place, he said.\nCetteete also made it clear that it’s important to allow people to hold passports in the hands of the time when they’re most vulnerable.\n']"

353,"Biking to work appears more dangerous than other commuting options, study finds","['(CNN) — Cycling to work is something that bothers up several people who can\'t stand boredom in the middle of the night, says a new study published in Psychological Science.\nMost people end up skipping cycling, and those who skip cycling struggle to find parking, and are unable to do much of anything. But the 2-year study sheds light on what is meant by a ""bad habit.""\nUsing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), researchers think it\'s a sign of boredom that bicycling allows people to safely try to ride. That\'s in part because Americans ride more than 190 million miles every year.\nThat can lead to bottlenecks -- or, in some cases, chronic traffic congestion -- that make it even more frustrating for those who will stop to pedal.\n""Biking for a problem is certainly one of the most frustrating activities, a reality that improves just as we all experience it, and provides us with alternative ways to engage in these activities,"" study author Andrea Cullen, a psychology professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, said in a statement.\nTo test the correlation between cycling and depression, Cullen and her colleagues recruited 1,076 adults from the United States and the Dominican Republic. In the study, they quizzed them about how much they travel. (A large national sample is designed to improve its accuracy.) After their finding, they asked them to complete a specific trail across the U.S. that they cycle to work.\nFor each trail, they asked them to set aside two minutes per day. Then they took a half hour. If they completed the task on time, they would go on a 10-mile commute.\nThe researchers found that people who bike to work tend to spend more time cycling than those who don\'t. As a result, they left more time for bicycles than people who bike to work. But cyclists had a higher rate of fatigue fatigue than people who don\'t bike to work. They also reported a higher rate of headaches, and had an increased body temperature over the study period.\nThe researchers believe that sharing information with one\'s primary co-worker or co-worker\'s boss is helpful in building a positive relationship between cycling and the work experience.\n""If shared information is beneficial, this could also improve the quality of the experience,"" said Kathleen Gray, assistant professor of organizational psychology at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.\nHowever, ""it would be difficult and economical to recruit a co-worker on a bicycle who is spending some time on a bike,"" Gray added. ""Many in the transportation community prefer to stay on the road, unless they live in poorer areas.""\nThe work-experience comparison isn\'t aimed at novice cyclists or those who can\'t easily switch to a crowded and crowded ride. In order to contrast the divide between people who cycle to work and those who are less physically fit, the researchers also tracked riders\' exercise habits.\nThe study shows that cycling makes people happier, even if they\'re on the most crowded roads. Cyclists who reported having enough exercise on a bike were 45% less likely to report decreased symptoms of depression. A study published in The American Journal of Preventive Medicine, earlier this year, indicated that bicycling could help people who\'ve struggled to control their stress.\nAt times, cycling can be very stressful, experts say. Some biking marts have turned people into subway riders, taking sides in sexual assault. And driving can cause distractions when listening to music while driving, and late at night, researchers say.\n']"
354,"Quarantines might stop coronavirus, but what happens if people break them?","['From basic shock protocol to the FDA to the Homeland Security departments, there are a lot of questions and teases about what to do with people infected with coronavirus-like viruses, when the virus has been acquired that could lead to death.\nIt’s not clear what to do. If you’re infected with an infected person, as I’ve said in various accounts, then the infrequent/reversible infusion of chlorine and radiation may cause the spread of the virus to other viral hemorrhagic fevers. But all that could be halted, or at least some bills of response are pending.\nA virus that was first reported on the popular website wthruff.com on Wednesday is about as deadly as the Ebola virus. It spread across the Americas, Africa and in the U.S. on Feb. 17, spreading quickly after having been captured in a remote location in Guinea.\nAn unknown virus has been identified in nine Caribbean islands and the Caribbean itself. At least four of those islands are located in some way or another after the recent outbreak that was sparked by the U.S. outbreak.\nIf the outbreak is spreading freely, the virus could result in the deaths of as many as 70 people in the U.S. alone, according to the CDC. (It should be noted that the disease usually leaves behind no identifiable microorganism.)\nThe CDC may recommend that adults born in West Africa apply for immediate government or other protective measures. In the U.S., some states may impose a 50% or higher death limit for all infected individuals.\nAt the other end of the scale, the Environmental Protection Agency has some guidelines that may help figure out what to do with people infected with coronavirus-like viruses. They have already issued a Jan. 26 directive that has prompted questions.\nCases or infections which have been previously discovered in Europe have involved people who also contracted the virus but contracted nothing. But it might not be enough to stop the virus. And if the CDC does decide to initiate an outbreak, this could be that very time, especially as high-profile companies are testing novel potential treatments.\nOverall, it appears the federal government has had enough of the coronavirus outbreak, so what happens if people break the symptoms and either die or start spreading the virus?\nIt’s also important to remember that coronavirus can be lethal if not treated in a timely manner. And you can’t use it to shut down the nation’s healthcare system.\nFor the moment, the CDC’s guidance has focused on providing care to ill victims, although “final” advisories are still being sent out. “Health professionals in commonwealths are instructed to advise with the aim of preparing for a possible outbreak and providing care to those affected,” as reported by the Health Information Technology Agency.\nThey say as with any outbreak, the most important thing to know is that the person who dies or is infected has the potential to spread the virus to others — including through people you know — through regular contact with them. If they hit someone in the clinic, for example, they may spread the virus to other people or encourage others to come in contact with them. This could turn out to be contagious illness after treatment, or in fact to be lethal.\nBut what happens if the vaccine hasn’t been successfully administered? And does death occur without the vaccine in the patient’s lifetime?\n“We can confidently say that, at this stage, no suspected cases of coronavirus have been reported,” Dr. John Ingle, director of the CDC’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote on a telephone briefing Thursday.\nThe CDC hasn’t had one case of a coronavirus, but for the most part, coronavirus cases are relatively rare, compared with the worldwide outbreak. The World Health Organization says 65 cases of coronavirus in children have been confirmed in the United States and 73 in developing countries.\nThe CDC currently takes about one case per day. The CDC is aiming to have three cases per day in 2018 and four every day from 2020 to 2050.\n']"

What is it, is designed to help us discover less intimate sex in a cheap system.\n“We are almost cloning our sex life –” the Sexty website description says, arguing that they were created for non-sexual reasons.\nThey claim they seek to “unlock intimate areas and enhance sexual pleasure”.\nSexty will try to de-friend your partner by making you uncomfortable and unbuttoning your partner’s lapel or nipples, according to the site.\n“Our goal is to contribute to safe sexual practices that solve societal (and neuroscientific) sexual dynamics,” the Sexty website description explains.\nThe site includes an image of a dildo being spat upon.\nSexty also claims that to be aware of unintended consequences is a key part of its appeal.\nHuma Elda, the founder of the Sexty website, recently told GeekWire that their concept involves using digital images to generate memories in a digital game.\n“There are so many crazy sex stats like pregnancy and leg pain, and we take the analog efforts we create with sex brain and design those out to create these thoughts,” Elda said.\nSexty is a platform designed to be used for recruitment and real-life adoption.\nTo be a sex innovator, Elda says that sex devices should address the issue of how sex experiences are expressed and delivered.\n“We could not do it without the object and feeling,” she said.\nSexty is not the first sexual technology project. Stanford University rewrote the A.I. infamously used to determine skin samples and want to argue against skin-reported inflammation, the Associated Press reported in 2015.\nThe Associated Press reported that each sex research project focuses on how these systems interact with the body.\nSexy develoopers\nSexy develoopers are an augmented reality tech that they turn into a sex toy, the ASHVR “they” or ASUs that look like a sex toy in a state of undress.\nThey include sensors with cameras on the back, doors to the genitals and a maze that houses infrared sensors and voice control devices.\nSexy and sexy develoopers will be available on Kickstarter for $349 and also available on the Amazon Store for $599.\nThis video and accompanying art presentation series is a resource for sex parties, gatherings and readings.\nSina is an Indian-American social media innovation platform.\nAs Sexy’s site explains, “[The sex app] means – no one here knows what sex requires.

He writes, “I bought it for myself, a friend so that I could take an pic of our kimono and go to the bathroom.”\nThe kit includes a nylon z-on skin cover, a pair of baggies, pins, and a gift. It costs about $20. Yuzu tells CNN it’s designed for rich people in need of a clean look.\nThe tags show that Z-on-z-on – translated into “and” meaning “into or out,” and “E” meaning “not available,” are invisible to you and there is no privacy.\n“It’s the first time that you get a kimono from someone who didn’t enter it into the computer,” Ruzhu says. “It will give you your future photos so you can make money from it.”\nZ-on-z-on doesn’t have to be a life-threatening illness. All that it has to be for the kimono is safety.\nOnce your kimono is accepted, you’ll have made the perfect gift for yourself, as Ruzhu describes it.\n“The only thing I’m not sure is if it’s going to work,” she says. “The boxes are designed with safety in mind.”\nIf you like the kimono, it will cost you about $20.\n']"
384,China cosmetic surgery apps: Swipe to buy a new face,"['Somewhere, China\'s fresh makeup alarm has been playing catch-up with new ways of emulating other cultures.\nAs student experimenters, they can pre-order face masks from brands such as Mandarin Mango, Look Better, Li-Gong Li and Lynan. As a trade tip, a reputable chemist offering a page-and-a-half assessment of these products can get the best results.\nSo what if Chinese come across a face that\'s both older and new? Get started today.\nI visited China\'s cosmetic apps for medical purposes last weekend. I\'m looking forward to what Chinese pop culture historian Ha Jung Ji hoped would be the first time I\'d been able to buy a face mask from a Chinese brand.\nBack in 2009, a dramatic exhibition at the Giverny Museum of Asian Art in China featured real faces from the ""Herb Cult."" The exhibition focuses on Hong Kong, Guangdong and Bansay Ima Hua, a nine-year-old girl who goes by the moniker Shep. Then she became a pop star. (She held back a Japanese face-painting technique a decade ago). The exhibition was filmed and later morphed into a six-episode miniseries on BANG Showbiz, a photo magazine started out as a youth radio program called BRAS.\nIn the series, Shep met six-year-old classmate Luen Yuxiang, who appeared in three films in Hong Kong. She took over the lead role as Luen. (Luen is also spelled ""l."" The show is filmed on location in the streets of Shanghai\'s Forbidden City.)\nLuen is exhibited and interviewed this year in a series of monthly ""Shen Yun Style"" concerts.\nWhile traveling the apron strings around my neck, I noticed a tall, black face with braces. The slight redity wasn\'t noticeable, until I realized that most of her teeth were crooked.\nAlthough I don\'t know the name of her, I\'m using a name that is derived from her own appearance. ""Brained,"" ""partial,"" or ""substantial,"" or ""arty,"" I choose.\nLike many of the dozens of banned apps, using a combination of the two is a pain. The app requires a password to open, but that is usually handled using a password base-style control app.\nThe new apps appear to focus on perfecting the look of natural-looking faces. I didn\'t have much trouble finding the masks of Iyang Da(pronounced ""Satire"") and Li Ying(pronounced ""Ho""). One, Li Hak\'an (pronounced ""Yyushu""), looked like a legendary figure of Chinese culture, and an unusual color: dark blue. I bought one.\nI waited an hour and a half to order it, waiting for a one-hour wait in the museum. (The wait in China has become even longer with overnight wait times.)\nIn hindsight, I might have been even happier. In November 2015, Chinese national poet Han Yanjing launched the #WearersChooseDresses hashtag, noting that women who weren\'t wearing lots of makeup, including brows, would be forced to wear brows on their face in order to achieve a suitably glamorous face.\nI bought a mask two months later. Two years later, the company that runs the registry is making a sweater, a baseball cap and sunglasses. The Face Effect or Weare App campaign, which was featured in China\'s much-hyped video festival, is a little more complicated.\nThe brand identifies themselves by the positioning of the brand\'s products. Besides the facial masks, the app named Its Position app allows users to search for a different cosmetics brand each month.\nTo me, Weare\'s app seemed geared more toward developing better faces. Maybe that\'s why it hasn\'t yet caught on in China.\nIn the meantime, I can buy a mask and take part in a parade in eastern China, where like most cities in China, the market is saturated. I\'ll try it, or at least try to research a new face.\nInnovation in face masks and makeup isn\'t limited to China. In France, labels used by such industry giants as Procter & Gamble and Estee Lauder were opened to foreign consumers.\nAntonio Collin, CEO of China\'s Herb Cult, says there are over 170 makeup brands in China.\nHe says China represents at least 40% of the fashion apparel, beauty and accessories consumers there. His company has produced close to 300 face masks and facial masks, he said.\n']"

But Joanna Honick, a professor of behavior at the University of Missouri, Madison, was adamant that the phrase doesn’t make beauty optional.\n“It’s been my philosophy since I was in a modeling program, and I’ve never actually heard it,” Honick said. “On television, someone will say that Beauty is compulsory. It’s not when people come to a club.”\nHonick pointed out that the US has virtually no such requirement or reason for beauty.\n“That’s how much beauty it entails,” she said. “If a skin-care product is actually worth something, a doctor will label it. That’s most commonly considered ‘beauty’ when it isn’t necessarily made to be more desirable, or not at all.”\nHilton Moms and Papas like Honick agree that beauty is needed more than ever, but can it be so controlled by Mother Nature?\n“In addition to that, we had a lot of beautiful people just talking about loving the color of their skin. So if you want to put beauty out there, that’s what you need to do,” Honick said.\nStill, Honick worried that a rich and diverse body is the only way to be celebrated. She urged people to exercise more, to get through their day, and to become taller and leaner.\n“To me, everybody’s got the same issues, and that’s why no one wears sunglasses, no one wears grey slacks, no one wears bright colors,” Honick said. “It’s all about acknowledging beauty and respecting people.”\nWatch what Joanna Honick had to say about beauty in the video below.\n']"

I think that Asian American women today are depending upon who they are as model, and it is through this regard for living their lives and growing up in their own role as models that Asians as females are set to define themselves in the public eyes. This attitude is associated with male white women, and it makes them say out loud and insist on a different meaning in people’s minds. But the idea that Asian women must define themselves as their identities to survive and live their lives is what many Asian American women are not ready to break free from when it comes to their diversity of sexual preferences. I would like to suggest a solution in this area for the sake of the people who are between the ages of 21 and 55.\nI have a question: are Asian American women having to tell their hair stories or get browns and green paper articles written on them? First off, my hair story started as a living history piece and has evolved over the years to include many more appearances of Asian American women. I was a teenager growing up and learned all the words and phrases as a girl. My feelings on Asian American women led me to a keen understanding of Asian American history. One cannot deny the many cultural, racial, linguistic, cultural, and physical issues that Asian American women must still deal with when it comes to their own identity. If Asian American women are taught to disregard the deep messages of the “Ava” myth, they must also stop judging Asian American women based on stereotypes, stereotypes and stereotypes, they must remember that a self-proclaimed __________ can bring racism, sexism, homophobia, racism, sexism, homophobia, ethnic stereotypes, homophobia, sexism, etc. Alyssa has even added male names to her title since the girl reached adulthood and developed an “Ava” mentality based on her childhood memories of the “Ava Moon” etc.,\n']"

So, on a dry note, we’re picking up on the rights and responsibilities of what comes next.\nThere are only two formal policy priorities, both of which are seen as too complex for our familiar smartphone system to handle: Asset preservation and ethics. Another issue that is unclear for many personal transformations is the sustainability of objects. There are very few ecological reasons why we leave little beautiful hanging on the side of our brick walls, let alone any historical or creative inputs. That means no technology, no aesthetics and no easier sourcing.\nIt’s an unfortunate conundrum we face more than we can understand. I choose to remain that way even though technology has been found in hundreds of different products — not once in my life, at least — and I am proud to leave that individual behind in a state of California’s fashion monotonous gray.\nTreating something as just a pink, happy or a red lipstick thus leading to the next unpleasant experiment is fraught with dilemmas.\nStill, we are becoming more conscious of our choices.

389,Photographer Kyle Weeks uses his medium to show that manhood in Africa is not a singular image,"['For two years, a young photographer for the South African military has been documenting the war in the Central African Republic, but he didn’t have any idea what he was going to display his works of art.\nThe images, which had been shot with the latest GoPro Hero cameras, included that increasingly strange, exotic mix of contemporary and old shots showing individuals – both white and black, male and female.\n“The results had to be unreal,” Weeks said. “We sat down with our friends and said, ‘Let’s stop making these.’”\nFULL COVERAGE: Faces of AIDS-affected people in Africa\nInstead, he had his work originally used in the Vietnam War and by the time he got to Africa, he was struggling with the effects of his photo work.\nLast year, the photographer started taking some notes to see how his art had been created in an attempt to find the demons left behind when combat was over.\n“I realized the story of war—the war and genocide—is incredibly powerful and moving,” Weeks said. “I had become very disillusioned and frustrated with myself, and it made me realize I could not be an artist any more.”\nSo Weeks decided to use the medium to show that manhood is not a singular image.\n“I wanted people to know it isn’t that I’m an object only,” Weeks said. “I am not an artist. My work has a human aspect, it does not exist in the image.”\nObservers in Africa\nCamera technology has supported the use of photography as a source of social media literacy. And throughout the development of the Internet, photographers have captured messages or social topics that quickly come back online.\nSelf-portraits are the fastest way to document what’s happening in Africa through digital hands-on experiences. In order to help people understand what it’s like to work in one’s own country, the emerging digital technology, IKEA, offers tools that help people understand that each other, or even what it means to be “fully awake.”\nIn addition to the modern digital photography, cameras designed to protect against car accident complications through their clarity and coverage can also be a double help. In fact, a 2014 study in the journal Vensiology shows that people get picture-posters if cameras provide a better representation of their position.\n“One easy way to make a communication tool like IKEA frames and documents an incident that happens in Africa; through an app, an Instagram, a Buffer, and the ability to post it by yourself and your friends,” Weeks said.\nFurthermore, he has picked up mobile technology to aid the facilitation of communication through digital phones. Right now, many people in North Africa look forward to when they may be able to interact with the camera in Africa.\nDissemination of Photography\nMany North Africans for whom photography isn’t or doesn’t bother them believe in photography, but these images work because they’re “always interesting,” in Weeks’ case.\n“They often simply picture an object and reflect their imagination,” Weeks said. “One thing that shouldn’t be emphasized is that certain images may be sad, violent, or disturbing. In other words, photography can facilitate communication between ordinary people and even normal people—but it is also important to add context, to make the images that actually relate the medium more appealing and inspiring.”\nStill, as Weeks and his colleagues use the medium to share his personal experience with one another, it has a positive impact on the quality of the African manhood and its impacts on others.\nFor him, that translates into active, well-being for the rest of us.\n“I don’t care if I write poetry or read ballet or anything else. I want to be active, to have a high quality of the youth’s life. If I want to get back into a job and see how it would affect my dad and my daughter, then I can,” Weeks said.\n']"

394,Louvre Abu Dhabi: Enter the 'universal museum' of human creativity,"['To infinity and beyond!\nThe museum has been on a mission, with an ambitious timeline, to explore, in cooperation with more than 40 museums worldwide, from Seoul to the Vatican. By creating an immersive experience designed to replicate the unique experience of art history, ""Desmond,"" as it\'s called, aims to give visitors a perspective on the exhibition at which it is housed.\nFrom its examination of architecture at the National Design Museum, the Paris-based museum is now drawing on the spiritual, artistic and metaphysical power of human creativity. The museum, which has 12 exhibitions currently, encompasses exhibits showing many of the human studies, works by intelligent and mathematical artists, movement and speech-making on the 21st century, along with concepts such as mind control, simulated communication, mental theory and intensive physiotherapy.\nThese are among the many avenues connected by the architecture and philosophy museum, conceived by artist Morte Auguste Neumann, who is able to lay out whole sets of concepts, as well as explication each individual component of art, in vibrant and expertly executed exhibit designs, readjustments, etchings and variations of existing and future works.\nThe level of detail required to develop these materials, is extensive, said Petra Csi, the children\'s curator and an expert on human form and psychology at the UAE museum. By creating precise details of a specific geometric structure, Neumann explains the effects of materials upon performance and mechanics, as well as describe mechanisms by which individual artforms form from bodily and physical measurements, to other mental or physical conditions, are being perceived by and from our daily lives.\n""The spaces that the design creates are functional, allowing individual artisans to create it and in-between, express themselves,"" said Pergutta Kaweng, who organized the show, which was organized by Tiffany & Co. in cooperation with New York\'s Rosenfeld Gallery.\nKaweng\'s piece is made of artistic materials, such as inks, carved woods, potted quartzite and polished watercolors. Each piece is represented in three types -- the first decoration is handmade complete with polychrome laminate, the last with brass laminate, fluke, habanero and silver spade. A board creates a two-dimensional interpretive surface that can stand out in a showing room. Each piece is treated with a functional seal that cleans up and moulds the surface of each piece for the entire presentation.\nCsi understands that the “universal museum” is part of a larger artistic vision of the UAE, created to appeal to audiences around the world, rather than just the UAE\'s values, similar to those expressed by artisans in Norway and France. The installation will coincide with the installation of the opening of the museum\'s permanent collection next year.\n""The universal museum is going to capture the spirit and enthusiasm of artisans and to extend the museum\'s participation in its artistic process for a diverse audience that is varied,"" said Iwon-Berge Sorota, art curator of the African Arts Museum, which now houses the treasures from the Egyptian and Tunisian cultures.\nVanishwaiz Zinfiqi, director of the Abu Dhabi museum, said the project gives the UAE exceptional access to more than 400 works of art. While the UAE has long been open to foreign art, it’s reaching out more to Japanese, Chinese and African galleries and work groups to develop its professional staff, for instance.\n""The UAE has opportunities to work alongside other African countries and with other regional and international bodies, but we also need to work with some internationally recognized organizations and institutions like the African Arts Museum, as the number of institutions seeking African content comes down,"" she said.\n']"

396,Photographer Martin Parr on Britain in the age of Brexit,"['Photographer Martin Parr says how Britain’s Brexit vote “destroyed everything you had the hope that something might happen”.\n“It broke everything you had the hope that something might happen,” says the bespectacled Bradford-born and close friend of President Donald Trump.\nThis once-economically sophisticated England was next door to one of world’s leading diplomats in New York, where he also co-founded international rights group the International Commission of Jurists.\n“I was on the front pages of all around the world, the talk about the US becoming the ‘popularity country’, to everyone that there’s a slightly smaller metropolitan scene in Britain, but then I’d been to New York for 100 years and you could see the real nippiness and the integration of cultures. And then I took an exhibition from London and saw how Heathrow has emerged from so much urban deprivation,” he tells CNN’s T.A. Newshour.\nOver the next nine years he moved back to Britain, shunning the capitals of EU cities, flooding London with visitors and scoring opportunities for companies in South America.\n“There was a bigger factor that the fact that the Trump administration, now Trump, is really losing the gold medal is more of a generational thing that I’m aware of. A lot of that I myself have to take into account for the rest of my life as it applies to me as an artist, to present that at the best,” he says.\nSo why did Britain go so irrationally with the EU?\nThe answer was partly because he didn’t like that kind of arrangement, he says.\n“This is fundamentally a bodyless society,” he says. “You have everything: a castle, a bank, a house, a park. If you know what you’re giving away, you can pay your customers in taxes. If you want a bank for your tenants, you can pay theirs.\n“So you have to regulate social services, regulate tax, regulate online payment system, and you have to impose new taxes and regulations for all those places and frankly there’s nothing to stop it. It’s an economic mess, it’s an ethical mess, it’s dangerous, it’s dangerous to be a part of,” he adds.\nThis is why he feels there is an increasingly global economy, taking global markets away from the rest of the world.\n“I understand that, with globalisation, one thing is fairly basic. But it has gone underground, it’s not being reflected in commerce in this country, its all being done through art, our galleries or our universities, it’s all being made by someone who’s in a similar position, and it’s depressing what’s going on here,” he says.\n“It really doesn’t make much sense to me, because that doesn’t really drive the thought around Brexit to any extent.”\n']"
397,'Part of the conversation': Outspoken artist Anish Kapoor opens retrospective in Beijing,"[""With formal family lineage and respect for the history of China, Anish Kapoor was just 18 when he began researching acting for a film called “The Master.” It was a breakout success in China, capturing the attention of most Asian audiences and a legion of Hong Kong fans. But when it came time to start speaking up at the University of Southern California for a BFA class, Kapoor realized a teaching credential – BFA in my English – made the difference. That changed for many of his peers, eventually leaving him with a massive international following. In 2016, Kapoor became the face of arts and culture in China as one of the leaders and activists responsible for moving the country toward modernization.\nHis documentary “MUSLIM,” set in China, presents a timeline of his years of research, examining the layers of “The Master”’s and Kapoor’s life from conception through his creation.\n“BFA taught me how to edit and I didn’t have to be like that,” Kapoor said during a conversation with CNN recently. “It’s like nobody had taught me how to make a film.”\nKapoor’s documentary is quite unique in that it sees him as a Russian author with a nose for “political” films. He said he wanted to talk about a historical point and the choice of the work he did as part of a thesis project.\n“It was really about how you make these movies. I spent time doing other films that didn’t make it on my own,” Kapoor said. “The Master” is about two sons who live in a century-old part of China under dictatorship, long suspected of murder. Kapoor, after writing the script, realized that the moral bearings of the films were missing.\n“When he kept them, it kind of sort of stuck together like a bike – I didn’t follow it. It’s something I really wanted to talk about.”\nThe documentary includes interviews with Kapoor’s family and friends. In some of the interviews, they don’t leave his family alone. One of his oldest friends, Hu Jeong, kept drinking, until he was lost. Later, Kapoor once disclosed that he briefly separated from his son.\n“That shit wasn’t the most interesting thing to watch,” Kapoor said, of his childhood. “He didn’t tell me, 'All the real parents have left me.' ”\nIn the film, Kapoor spoke to his father about “Master” and urged him to create a better version of it. He also points out that the film told a story of a punk rocker who came to the Big Apple, pulling out his socks and identifying himself as a bodybuilder. It’s something that Kapoor has kept up with since “The Master.”\nAnish Kapoor has lived and studied in Hong Kong.

He and his team have worked since the 1970s to create many masterpieces including “Harlem Sproul” and “Ye Savo.” They went on to win a TV competition and three films as part of award-winning ASCA movement.

It could be a brilliant representation of a utopian society, but it could also be such a play on aesthetics.""\nThe mural\'s app uses the New York City high school wall and other historical images of the area for inspiration.\n""We are like a hologram of something,"" Kirschbaum said.\nThe text of the text helps represent the landscape because it represents an ""impassioned"" reality, Kirschbaum said.\n""I like the way that the painting contrasts the reality,"" Kirschbaum said.\nPritzker Prize 2020: Wood shift\nHarvey Macky-Jones of Washington, D.C. has been one of the few rising international architects who survived an editor\'s strike by the Alliance of African American Architects, which threatened to shutter the 157-year-old organization.\nHe has done architecture projects for cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Orlando, West Palm Beach, Chicago, Detroit, Austin, London, and Boston.\n""I\'m going to join the Academy of Architecture and Design,"" Macky-Jones told CNN about an aria du l\'art with co-founder Marie Dunn.\nHe explained the use of the space as a symbol of an aesthetic shift.\n""The fact that architecture is shift is very telling to what we are experiencing today in terms of history,"" Macky-Jones said.\n""I have learned the hard way how change happens.

402,Has the wooden skyscraper revolution finally arrived?,"['(CNN) - Building by the buzz word in construction-speak, a slender, elevated tunnel has finally arrived for shuttered South Tower at Tokyo\'s Nikkei Tower.\nTokyo skyscraper crews have been hard at work for months to build the monument, which boasts 2,770-foot ceilings and supports every conceivable structure imaginable: shipbuilding, oil rigs, schools, churches and waterfront parks. Construction is just beginning on a colossal concrete pyramid - a towering eight-story skyscraper measuring more than 26,000 feet (11,000 meters).\nThe project, tied up in a 1998 Tokyo earthquake, and which is scheduled to begin at the end of the month, is finally heading into completion. With so much need for it to start, construction was initiated more than a decade ago when the ninth-tallest building in the world, the 103-story Anja Fischer Kochi New Sails, opened in 2000.\nThe 23rd-tallest building in the world, the 11th-tallest skyscraper, Venice Beach, went up later that year. The tallest building in America was actually the one that graced the Plaza Hotel in New York City.\nBut the 16th-tallest building in the world, the 250-story Sky Tower in Madison Square Garden, New York, was an unfinished Macondo-sized record breaking hole constructed in 2011 after the 1929 stock market crash.\nThat doesn\'t mean it won\'t happen again, though.\n""For an encore in the Garden Theater, we\'re all going to be a generation older,"" said Jamie Barrett, senior executive vice president of TowerAid, the nonprofit that brought the tower to life.\nThe system already has ties to former Red Sox pitcher, owner and finance chief Jack Neidhardt. In a garage, Neidhardt spent 10 years building a variety of buildings with his family, including a one-story transmission tower and public housing units. He designed the facade of the Maison Mocourt, a 6th-floor facade tower, erected in 1912 and that was the most decorated building by any of the American businesses in the financial capital.\n""Our millennial generation that\'s stuck with it has always been very supportive of it,"" said Jiro Okamoto, the one-story general manager of Tokyo-based TEVA, which is responsible for putting up the tower. ""Once our marketing manager finishes putting up the towers, people start liking it. They love it. It\'s a unique asset.""\nThe developer of the tower, Tokyo Dome Development, recently released a six-page itinerary detailing the lobby, architect and exterior design, calling it ""the first augmented reality tower of all time."" On May 12, the tower will begin the first-ever use of 4G video camera technology. And in June, the home of the world\'s tallest buildings, the $42-billion Rimyorashi Twin Towers, will be first to host a digital billboard.\nSo what is all this like? Unlike the similar projects of Florence\'s Beso Tower in Florence, this one\'ll get built around almost 60 meters of concrete. The last time it was completed, the Los Angeles Town Center, once touted as the world\'s tallest, opened the morning after the quake struck near the epicenter.\nFor some, that was a disaster.\n""We saw the city was going to change forever,"" said Gordon Hsiao, a 58-year-old retired teacher, who lives in Hong Kong, where the gates had been locked up. ""The last time that they built this in time for the next earthquake, it was more than eight feet tall. This time, I think a lot of people saw it, too. And very few saw how it was a relief.""\nA crucial part of the challenge is permitting. How many of the beams in the chimney of the first building, like the mammoth, adorn the second building, a 46-foot-tall structure called THE Reichmerukson, will need to be replaced? Will it need to be built on an average of 10 feet of steel?\n""There are still thousands of fans when this first building opens,"" said Oded Anjman, chief executive of The Hawks, a developer of 40,000-foot Olympic and Paralympic chalets built in Chicago, the site of the 1933 World\'s Fair. ""It has five beams and six bolts going at a time.""\nSome other issues, too. Residents of the former Reichmerukson Tower told CNN they wanted the tower built with steel and alluvial steel - needed for pipes and extensions to carry electricity. The builder said all 37 metal doors must have windows, doors, backs and walls.\n""The building has to be constructed in stone for seismic phases']"
403,Discarded photo negatives show China in an era of change,"['By Philip Wen\nFor decades, the misadventures of neon photographers have faded away.\nThe sleek red, white and blue stores of neon have flooded the market. From orange and yellow neon frames, to neon and blue neon bottles, neon and blue neon shades, neon pinks and blues, neon curvostrons and neon reds, pink, yellow, and blue neon bottles, neon colors and colors — at least one new high-performance camera has a point.\nThere’s one caveat, though: Some of these hard-wired neon electronics may simply be old and in need of repairing.\nWen is an attractive young artist from Heilongjiang Province. He has been developing neon-based microdevices since 2014 at the Qumai Lab Studio that he helped sell to Beijing Commercial Bank, which bought him with capital he could no longer spare. As part of his lab, he designed original circuitry to create devices that show advertisements for neon and neon brands.\nAn eyesore\nThe idea for his electronics after his father went missing in a car accident in 2010 earned Wen time at a hospital specializing in electronics research. (He was also a molecular biologist at the time.)\nIn March, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a directive requiring manufacturers of consumer electronics from Jan. 1, 2019, to create new devices containing the microchip technology by May 1, 2020. The policy was also meant to be seen as intended as a statement against China’s display companies, as imagery they promote is widely viewed as evil, damaging its image in the international community and generating income for overseas tech giants like Google and Microsoft.\nIn an interview with Reuters in Beijing, Wen said he had spent a year in incubation between the two sides of the accelerator program, which also includes work at the China Institute of Digital Electronics and Recycling.\nEven as well as working in a lab, he also “had a lot of research experience developing electronics.”\nHis work in the lab in 2016, he said, included drawing textiles, jewelry, products and street merchandise on the insides of microgreens, which serve as catalyst.\nAn artist rendering of the current growth and development of microtechnology over the past 10 years. Courtesy of InterNorth London, USA.\nDuring a conversation with Reuters, Wen said, “I don’t see it as a legacy project. I see it as a skillful service project.”\n“Chinese electronics companies are an important part of a country of 85 million and they are very open about their technology capabilities. If they are not as transparent as we want them to be, that’s a major issue,” he said.\nTo be fair, Chinese consumers do indeed purchase an electronics product there, especially in mobile phones, but that market grows so rapidly that several tech giants have some direct exposure to the idea.\nA simple microchip lens will offer over 75% to 90% coverage, while a simple design that is top secret also boasts space for a photo-resolution camera lens. The evidence is not enough to convince some that brands and the media are not cashing in on the boom in small nanos, or microchip-based microdevices.\nWhile brand fragility is the real worry here — and if the prevalence of so-called random microchips can also be ruled out — there’s also the issue of PRS we’ve all had many, many times this year: how little is known about how blue neon sells; and how much price is beyond anyone’s control.\nAnd despite resistance, at least one manufacturer is in China.\n']"
404,Why the NBA All-Star Game is a runway in its own right,"['You know, it was back in January when NBA All-Star Week began, and the story of the league\'s ongoing evolution of the sport, let alone the sixth NBA All-Star Game, offered it\'s replay evidence.\nWell, for starters, it was a good time to be up against LeBron James and company.\nMost of the NBA All-Star Game, you may recall, was media day, a very ""let\'s look at where we can go,"" team versus player.\nMaybe LeBron wants you to know that the NBA All-Star Game doesn\'t take place in a hotel room.\nOr maybe James wants you to know that he\'s catching the wind when he\'s game.\nI doubt, and may not say here, that, when you\'re hosting an All-Star Game that functions like an actual national team, you\'re not, just like you\'re hosting a broadcast.\nYou host an All-Star Game? You lead them in the announcement room? See, the franchise is big enough, you\'ve got enough personnel, and if you\'re hosting one of them, you\'re doing it right.\nAnd yet, when there\'s an actual game being played at the game itself, and nobody\'s broadcasting it, you\'re hosted to a small screen the way in which it was before.\nSixty-four cities, eight teams, a pool of like-minded people, and twenty-five college basketball coaches or coaches.\nI will confess to having never tuned into the All-Star Game, or been remotely interested in All-Star Weekend, or even its programming, until yesterday.\nIn fact, the NBA All-Star Game always attracts comparison to the NFL All-Star Game, but I\'ll stipulate otherwise that no.\nI say that because this isn\'t the league\'s crown jewel. It doesn\'t have a core, a catalog of superstars. And if you\'re considering the league as a broadcast network, it has to bear a certain certain cost.\nIf All-Star Weekend proceeds to be the equivalent of Game Day, or Game of the Century, you could even be charging for everything else you can be a part of. And if the sport has just slipped below the radar, you could never seem to get a word in edgewise.\nChampioned by young superstars, and standing against far-fetched, defensive targets like, um, the Miami Heat, the NBA All-Star Game is a business worth doing.\nThere\'s a great deal of success here to be had when you\'re hosting the All-Star Game. While there\'s a lot of chatter about whether the NBA\'s the most profitable corporation in history, having a serious championship title in your hands is a little more appealing.\nWanting to be part of a war chest, or standing in the way of the NBA\'s best campaigns, says you\'ve got to be preparing. And while we\'ve covered many complaints about the league\'s Yearbook, this year\'s edition may have expanded upon what was happening in previous years, in which, at a minimum, the league goes back to four rags.\nAgain, this column is about actual facts. In true basketball tradition, much of what we know about events is happening in places that we know nothing about.\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of CNN\'s editorial board or CNN International.\n']"

They’re among the greatest pieces of Leonardo da Vinci’s work — first displayed at The Barnyard Museum in Boston in 1809.\nThis collection of contemporary pieces, on loan from the State of New Hampshire, was a cornerstone of American ornamental art and practices, making up the museum’s program for the past 10 years.\nOthers have appeared on loan from galleries around the world, including the Steven Spielberg Museum in Chicago, the Mondrian House in Geneva, Italy, the St. Cloud Galleries in St. Cloud, Minnesota, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\n“We always felt it was important to do a restoration and work that would establish the place of the older pieces that we thought were a real piece of art,” Ruth Sabel, director of the Massachusetts Paintings Restoration Society, said in a statement.\n“There are so many amazing pieces in all these galleries, we have to have the best of both worlds,” said John McInerney, director of the Hoopla League Gallery, which has the restoration project open at the Massachusetts Historical Society.\nMore than 2,000 mementos made by visitors to the museum will be on view in up to 100 museum spaces at the beginning of April. Upcoming items include Guillermo Polanco’s model of the Cicero Monument, installed in 1889 and dedicated at Barlow Art Museum, a 100-year-old British instrument that was imported from France during the Depression to create a piece of 17th-century 18th-century art.\nMore than 70 pieces are available, including items that were commissioned by the Barlow Gallery and others, according to Sabel.\n“As one of the world’s leading visitor agencies, it’s always really nice to see the many pieces that are already visible and exciting,” Sabel said.\nOnce you choose one of the 35 pieces for sale, you’ll have to get approval from the American Association of Museums or to find one of the special offers on the web page.\nOverall, the purchase is worth more than $60,000, according to Sabel. The museum will admit to a small number of the restored objects to help collectors keep track of them.

Attendees said they expected to see even more pushbacks, if they ever felt comfortable with the policies they have left unchanged.\nPyoo, a trendy Southeast Asian neighborhood with 10 bars and a concert venue just blocks from Seoul, challenged Seoul\'s Pro Party administration to apply more robust crackdown tactics to preserve the same kind of tradition as one of its U.S. rival parties.\n""The new approach is designed to ensure that we have continuity with some elements of LGBT politics,"" Pyoo said in a Facebook post. ""We believe this approach will block their advancement.""\nPyoo further called on the central government to ""make accommodations for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community and for it to receive the same government support as that of the minority.""\nThe local government has been trying to make accommodations for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, who can come out comfortably in their bedrooms or on outings in public places but have increasingly become targets of campaigns to gain visibility.\nPro-LGBT lawmakers have resisted efforts by the mayor of Seoul and Park Geun-hye to implement gay rights that contribute to the 30 percent drop in overall crime in the South Korean capital in the past five years.\nPolice at a tour of the hundreds of drag venues that have sprouted since their registration on Ellis Island in New York in 1986 seem optimistic that Seoul will join the large number of trans community in extortive acts of prostitution, sex trafficking, drug deals and other crimes.\nMore than 40 states have enacted laws that allow people to use, sell or let others use sex-edas, but no laws have been enacted to effect the same thing.\nAnti-trans activists generally have the support of conservative Seoul society.\n""I don\'t think there are huge differences between the two other parts of the country,"" said Andi Walander, who co-founded the organization Siding Up Seoul in 1980.

It urged the government to enact its policies in a time of economic growth.\nIt called for continuing to listen to South Korean values and dignity — something that South Korea shares with China and Japan.\nWalander also hopes to go to the Supreme Court in a non-confrontational lawsuit that would demand that Seoul\'s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender population ""be allowed to use a variety of civil-liberties protections as well as the right to have adult children available.""\nIt is far from clear that the gay and transgender population will get any pass from Park Geun-hye on other issues because she and Park are allies and friends, not business partners.\nAs parts of Seoul continue to grapple with unwanted expressions of anti-LGBT sentiment, activists are grappling with how to deal with a ""culture of fear,"" said Thae Woo-sook, a professor of Indonesian cultural and human rights.\n""One of the most important and important things is avoiding the perception that people are closeted,"" said Kim Tsang, who helped organize a drag party Sunday, where the police arrested people who had come from other districts.\nNorth Korean authorities have tried to poke the spotlight off South Korea by turning undercover sting operation into a high-profile PR exercise, in which they roughed up residents for being LGBT.

411,Brazil's fashion industry has a diversity problem,"['(CNN) — Two world-class companies combine to come to mind.\nFirst, L’Oreal, one of the world’s largest global beauty brands, is known in South America for the creatively high point of its products, a bottle of Atelier Listerine whose sparkling sheen is stamped on jeans by one of its owners and on beer leftovers from a fight over a famous event. Now, in the wake of the 2016 death of model Shelly Goldwater in Rio de Janeiro, L’Oreal has taken ownership of several top brands, among them Michelée as well as Purity Brand of St. Laurent in Paris.\n“It’s not like all these brands aren’t growing, and they’re certainly helping us [be] strong in Brazil,” observed Marvini Vola, founder and CEO of Ambrian.\nBut just like the already established luxury powerhouse, the Brazilian fashion industry isn’t feeling the same as the global beauty brands of the past couple of decades, which have tended to turn more toward the world of swimwear or fashion in the name of innovation.\n“Brazil is a world-class industry and it’s hard to evolve to a world-class market from Brazil,” said Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s first president and the son of former President Dilma Rousseff.\nAccording to Paul Murray, head of retail at luxury brand Jil Sander, Brazil is a stagnant market with a relatively low number of retailers, “just a few brands on shelves.”\nAnd that means more competition — “Look,” Bolsonaro noted. “If we want to make the biggest difference in the global market — and we don’t need other brands — we don’t need all the best Brazilian brands that look like Jil Sander.”\nAlso among the difficult realities of globalization, including the issue of sexual harassment in Brazil and the fallout of the Batista family’s destruction of the fashion industry.\nLike the American beauty brands, Aldo is an important mid-size player. With their high-end models offering value-of-accessories, the brand seems to be a perennial presence in Brazil. But even with an expansive brand portfolio, the Brazilian brand shouldn’t be overlooked.\nTale of the Tape: Brazil’s New Global Fashion Industry\nThe Brazilian Fashion Industry\nFor some fashion consumers, the fashion industry seems to provide the best in terms of choice. But perhaps worse is for those consumers who are too scared to take a chance.\n“A lot of young people — they’re scared of [getting caught],” Marc Storp, a fashion and branding professor at Amartya Sen University told CNN. “Everyone is scared of quality, just like some people can’t afford good clothing.”\nThe top three brands here are La Paradie and Louis Vuitton. In the last five years, the companies produced 12.4 million bags — up 4.6% from 2015. These products tend to be popular in a country where the everyday luxury touches are limited to hipster brands such as Hermes.\nBut to many, these stores are hardly any more luxury than the ubiquitous boutiques such as Moët & Chandon or the Gucci arm of the company. The designers’ products, aside from the oldest brands such as L’Oreal, are more upscale and have higher barrier-to-entry — in particular, women with a higher fashion sense.\n“That’s not the reason why all the luxury brands are interested in embracing Brazil,” said Murray, who is shortlisted for the upcoming TOWIE franchise. “It’s the lack of ambition and the lack of discipline in the brands because they’re not capable of delivering the upper-class clothes that they want.”\nA case in point is L.A. Vice President Natalie Pietsch. Backed by some 90,000 mega-chains, L.A. Vice President P.V. decides on her own.\nNovelty = welcome success\nThere’s a certain mystique about Odile Pascual that grates a little.\nA restaurant manager serving Moët & Chandon pasta in Brazil’s modern capital, Porto Alegre, Pascual opened her kitchen last year in a project that had become a sort of example of first step in reviving the city’s old style.\nLocated on the back of a local cafe, Odile’s kitchen has cupboard baskets full of o']"
412,How did Kim Jong Un get his Mercedes-Benzes? New report traces origin of North Korea's luxury rides,"[""Trevor Reating — a British adventurer whose own car was repainted in recognition of his use of a powerful car for New Year's Eve parties — has traveled to North Korea to seek insight into his new Mercedes Benz set—a piece of the Hanoi Hilton world’s most private life.\nAnd that's just the start.\nWithin days, Reating’s vehicle was towed from one of the Nippon Airlines’ flagship Kuala Lumpur flights. He’d driven his four other Brits around the harbor with a 12-hour rucksack, as he drank “caffie juice.” He’d held a $28,000 banner bearing an “I Voted You” sticker.\n“I’ve been to Pyongyang a lot,” said Reating, 29, in a phone interview from Malaysia. “I have hotel rooms on the east side, and so, they’re U.S. Southern Airlines for the first time.”\nA year after Kim Jong Un’s assassination, Reating’s caravan features a Mercedes-Benz sedan and exposed floor-covering aluminum doors and comes with a golden door bell.\n“To speak to someone who is reputed to be Pyongyang’s automaker is a rare feat,” says George Lewis, author of “The Life and Death of Kim Jong Un: Kim Jong Un and the Missile Crisis.”\n“You don’t come to the North Korean border or discuss the terms of the relationship with North Korea— they’re done before that. It’s a complicated world.”\nThe intrigue of their car experiences was well-documented.\n“Mr. Reating is a young American who grew up in Indiana, living with a very spoiled family and yet held on to the tail end of my life,” says Lewis. “This is a vehicle on the brink of extinction.”\nA historian at the University of Chicago studied the 65-mile tour on Jangtae Island, where Kim’s body had been dissected—and reassembled.\n“North Korea makes sense of Western platoons as we go about our lives here,” Reating says. “I always thought they were special locations. It was not only a gift to the North, but also kind of a victory lap for the state.”\nThe car in the Kim Jong Un’s possession was revealed to be under the name Saleshioc, which is, of course, his grandfather’s common-law name—instead of “Jong n” -- and was used as a model for a venture into Western art, and by Blue Nile.\nIt was, at the time, marketed in a retail store, but the founders never know what was behind the manufacturing process.\nAccording to Lewis, saleshioc was bought back into the company in 2009, and the company went public in 2011, this time represented by the bourse for North Korean companies.\n“Saleshioc has been trying to capture the North Korean corporate market for years,” says Lewis. “It may be best if it’s used as the Chinese company’s ongoing sales tool— on a strictly geopolitical level.”\nThe company and the automaker, where the conversation was about Canadian automotive.\nAt his holiday party in Kuala Lumpur, the grandson of German dictator Wilhelm II was driven by a BMW 7 Series sports car by the name of Angela, described by one critic as “model the one that rambles about cars.”\nThe Bentley Continental GTS of the mason was another big get from the salesman who was driving to die.\n“I would not take a Bentley on any dates,” Reating recalled in a telephone interview from Kuala Lumpur. “He didn’t get into a (North Korean) car. He got into a marriage with me.”\nDespite his resistance, he was able to access the powerful Mercedes-Benz G GDR on street street corners in Kuala Lumpur.\nOne of his costs had to be reimbursed by Apple, which commissioned the custom paint used in the car, and the vehicle was taken to a DMV for court cases.\n""]"
413,Ryugyong Hotel: The story of North Korea's 'Hotel of Doom',"['By T\nInto the Red Globe\nSoutheast Japan\'s Yamato Hotel in Honshu, north of Kyoto sits atop a volcano, this arching uprise offering even, under the watchful eye of motorists, the latest logo to be released by the force of the nuclear-armed north.\nIts glamorous party scene is topped by the upscale, glitzy Haut Bellevue Hotel, about 20 metres deep, designed to be its highest profile. Located in a part of the city known for its wood architecture, the hotel stands astride the surrounding lower east gate.\nDriving to the dining room from the upper lobby, we begin with a furtive sight. This may be as much a comment on the four-night stay at Haut Bellevue Hotel, a stay by the Japanese media detailing its \'\'hotel of the last days\'\' now published on no. 7.33 [7900]. These words are both of anxiety, apprehension and support for the rising war chances that threaten South Korea and Japan, aside from whatever these do not scuttle the economic and development development of the North.\nThe 34-metre trip, one to the Haut Bellevue Hotel and one to the Haut Bellevue Hotel in Paju, meets a similarly depressing reality.\nAt the end of the day, we are making our way to the Kōko Hotel, a 50-minute drive from Seoul, the story of the ""Mad Country"", where one such hotel is sitting now. All will answer the bell about the state of South Korea\'s construction industry.\n(Age: 75)\nWhy are they speaking about nuclear fallout?\nWe don\'t know. All we know is that the very young begin to view their hometown as a ""hotel that faded."" Today the family has begun having trouble making ends meet. North Korea is not their own country, but its own kind.\nAt the Hotel of the Last Days, we open ourselves up to a military while the great time is lingering. Soldiers are not in Europe. ""I saw the Korean War,"" says Kim Hoon, a worker at the hotel.\nThe only thing that is left to say is that Haut Tokyo is a World War II movie, built in only 50 days. The Sancho Panza Hotel (the hotel is a joint venture between London hoteliers and Tokyo\'s Hoch Real Estate), is in the middle of Itzhak\'s famous remodel.\nOur next destination, the Kōko Hotel, can be seen here.\nThe hotel was a well-liked place, but Kim\'s old boss and chief executive stayed in Japan long after the war ended and left the country in 1975.\nThe Monitor continues: “When the pre-war Kojo Shogun Hotel was located here, all types of Japanese staff worked there until retiring. Now, one may wonder how long before the two Kojo Shogun hotels now go out of business.""\nIf you are on a diet of constantly competing for the best tables, one would think these two really are a good match.\nIs this Nakabui Hotel?\nThe Japanese are basically very good at managing their hotels. At the Plaza Osaka, there are many regional accolades as well as international titans of hotels.\nIts layout is wonderful, their style, the service level, and they are close to local restaurants and out-of-town places to see.\nBut Nakabui Hainan is a bit different. Like most Japanese hotels, Nakabui has a limit of rooms for three months but visits are done on a regular basis for a couple of days.\n']"

416,Fashion gaffes are a reflection of the industry's diversity problem,"['A year ago I was in New York for a gathering of today\'s fashion geeks and faffes. It wasn\'t Glam Nation, but a rather eclectic week of fashion, conversations, and reclusiveness. I was invited to a Starbucks, my apartment, and house in Manhattan to learn how important I could be more than just the cause of change.\nOn the eve of Valentine\'s Day, I joined the challenge of co-creating the first trans-made furs in history.\nI hesitated briefly, but fortunately I had the courage to enter the vision because everyone else had already joined. There\'s a conversation to be had in my soul, but the idea of trans firsts as a commodity has nothing to do with the speed and scale of trans commercialization or the rigidity of policy. It comes from people who can\'t catch up to the modern space.\nIn addition to the subway rail, the first ever transgender person to be recognized in Chicago was Isabel Toledo, who\'s experienced 100km (42 miles) of traveling through a safe, secure and secure environment. An amazing second came from nine year old Abbie Hallett – the youngest person ever to do so. Her journey was a journey of hands-on empowerment. She had, and will continue to have, the courage to pursue her dreams while completing the all-time comestibles.\nCan anyone else really afford to be a part of a straight, cisgender, cis-male fashion house?\nIn finding ways to create trans-inclusive artists of every stripe, women and men wanted input from their peers.\nWithin a year the fashion design community of Brooklyn had joined forces. The fashion a/c process has evolved from body positivity and acceptability to inclusion, connecting one another to the cultures, histories, passions and values in the fashion world. It\'s everywhere, and in the fashion world.\nBeing trans-inclusive was a big part of it. In 2014, California was the first state to allow for gay marriage. This attracted a lot of new followers, since the state said: ""All men are entitled to equal rights, but the lack of equality prohibits the most basic freedoms like right to life and the ability to have a meaningful life."" Most importantly, ""All men are entitled to equal rights, but the lack of equality prohibits the most basic freedoms like right to life and the ability to have a meaningful life.""\nMeanwhile, social media grew. There were many who jumped into the cause and enrolled. Nick Hornby, for example, took to Twitter to call out the trans community\'s indifference. He added the hashtags: #""Toglifettogender (@nathosefinnegan) and #ToGlifettoforward (@sasharharmon) and his hashtag #TheGlenFosterFoorDidIt. Celebrities also took to Twitter to engage in solidarity and sharing their stories about their experiences.\nWhen it comes to making shoes, I will forever stay on the fence about the color of the shoe – sometimes I prefer light to dark. As in a way, while the choice on price and gender identity might be aesthetic and for whatever reason we are nothing but people\'s worst nightmares, we are nothing but people\'s most crucial assets.\nUltimately, it\'s about how you use them in a way that respects the person you are and allows them to provide the greatest contribution to your life. We all have an unmet need for shoes. Without the visibility we have, we are out of step with the beliefs we hold, and we don\'t build businesses from ethical ideals or even the ideals that are a beacon to the world.\nIt\'s not about whether we wear certain clothes, or if we choose to wear jewelry. It\'s about how we respond to being in this new world, and how we embrace being alive. The tide is turning in 2014. I\'ve no doubt about the outside job models that will develop.\n']"
417,Battle of Supremes: How 'legal fakes' are challenging a $1B brand,"['SAN DIEGO (CNN) -- It\'s the crazy or not the weird, all pretty messy shop that has gamers like me scrambling for the stars of the third weekend in a row at a Microsoft game.\nThat\'s because the big white-and-red of the year\'s biggest and strangest games, with an infusion of Superman versus the WWE, a large, shiny, and widely popular four-player grappling match, and a massive brawl here and there, is precisely the kind of game Microsoft has long dreamed of producing.\n""I don\'t think this is the world we are trying to create,"" said John Riccio, managing director at Digital Director International, a firm that handles planning for the games the company hopes to release for Xbox One and other platforms over the next year.\nRiccio praised Microsoft\'s early efforts to put out legitimate contenders in the genre, like Neverwinter Nights with Marius in 2010. Last year, RSCO snatched up an original Battlefield game for PlayStation 4 and Netflix Originals\' The Collection of Crunk costumes for Xbox One.\nBut how many former Battlefield games played, and what grip, is a hard question to answer, Riccio, a lot of observers agree. A sense that some of the games conceived to expand the genre, like Threshold Electronic Arts\' Sierra Sons, Force of Empires\' God of War: Ascension, were destined to fail remains a mystery to those who have the privilege of watching major new releases of the game world.\nHere\'s how the details about a new game into the franchise had to be translated by Blizzard Entertainment to fans\' ears, and how much of the game conversation had to happen in specific chapters where clans in medieval Japan were fighting over knights and dragon.\nThe newest game iteration still ""stinks,"" said Riccio. And the words ""ring"" and ""sword"" offer no insight into what to expect from the game until it\'s released.\nOver time, though, the games are evolving, and take the story by surprise and blow a soft blow.\nAs a result, it\'s clear that hardcore gamers are suffering from spasms in their concentration as they try to keep up with new franchises that we haven\'t seen before.\nRobot is a relative newcomer to competitive gaming.\n""It\'s kind of a weird game, and people like it,"" said Mikea Johnson, one of these figures.\nIn many ways, the game is like a hit for Shrek that\'s in keeping with the show\'s popularity. After the first Shrek cartoon, fans flocked to the Batman reboot that spawned a total of 40 million worldwide copies, selling out their shows and conventions across the globe.\nStill, one shows why console makers aren\'t on their best behavior.\nNintendo did a huge effort to ""disrupt"" its popular motion-sensing console, the Wii U. The game system -- meant to better mimic Wii U\'s motion sensing features, plus the graphical software underlay -- showed it could be retrofitted to the motion-sensing changes, too. The motion-sensing technology was a key factor in the Wii\'s breakthrough Wii U and subsequent Playstation predecessor, Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle.\nModern gaming is undergoing a ""quake"" that some critics fear could leave consoles behind with games being held out of common viewing purpose.\nLast year, Halo fans gasped at the rumors Microsoft had ""walked away"" from a reboot of the Halo franchise. It wasn\'t without merit. It was worth its tarnished reputation, but it was also risky.\nMicrosoft is working on the next iteration of Halo at Microsoft. A link is already being put up to efforts to share inside information on the game.\nBut what\'s easy to understand about Star Wars: Galaxy of War, the latest entry in the Star Wars trilogy, is that Star Wars fans are turning to it to acknowledge that its modern, traditional fare is less interesting -- and (hopefully) comparable to a knockoff.\nStar Wars and its resurgence, of course, will ultimately be made up of all sorts of other people looking to progress the franchise for the sake of keeping both fan interest and buzz alive.\nBut there\'s one game that calls itself an ""integrated systems integrator,"" meaning it\'s somewhere in between the cutting-edge games companies like Sony, Warner Bros. Studios and, on the whole, Microsoft\'s games.\n']"

Gone are the days when models focused on the sexiness, the luxe comfort and the glamor of the clothes.\nLook no further than Tommy Hilfiger\'s Fall 2013 show in his signature designer studio. ""In the past few years, we\'ve established greater influence on models by getting everyone talking, including the race, that is who they are, and which clothes make their person,"" he says. ""This includes a greater fear, confidence and sense of self.""\nSince the start of fashion\'s shift toward more premium stretchwear, craftiest menswear designers have brought their pieces into vogue.\nNo more traditional lace and sheer dresses and tuxedo-like jackets (but no longer are they so off-the-wall). No more decadent vixen outfits, just regular ones that give the image and fun of the brand.\nThe health and beauty trend, which, until now, was more focused on women\'s needs, is back in fashion.\n""Only a few years ago, it was considered that the top ladies did lingerie,"" says White. ""Instead, we see a crop of bold, inspired garments that reflect the current industry.""\nLook no further than the elaborately embroidered Calvin Klein pieces and elevated pop in the spring runway, an ad for this should surprise no one.\n""I understand and appreciate young women getting the attention and the attention to themselves, the treatment they receive,"" says White. ""But instead of trying to force the attention back on other women, they\'re repackaging something very powerful and frivolous.""\nAnd with that more tailored in mind, brands like Hermes, Givenchy and Balenciaga are now diving deeper into the wearables space.\nIn 2018, the trendiest fabric in the runway was the stainless-steel beige, with the runways serving as an appropriate jumping-off point. Now, over 50 percent of dresses in showrooms are in stainless-steel; 5 percent are in black leather and slim-capped Tykes.\nAt the same time, designers are expressing some of their own thinking on the subtlety of the fabrics that feed into the wearable elements they\'re designed to deliver.\nThey\'re mixing elements of both bathroom and air purifier systems, extending the era to make actual men\'s clothing look literally woven in an important way.\n""The goal is to fully develop our wearables into custom-designed garments with the natural relationship of texture to function,"" says Oren Karstinic, president of Dolce & Gabbana Group.\nOne of the ways these innovations can stretch the boundaries and impact on everyday life is by giving people what they crave.\nIn a recent interview with French media, Topshop founder Patrick Stewart described his new line inspired by heartthrobs like Rebecca Minkoff, David Jones and Alexander McQueen.\nThe Italian designer would have nodded nodded as he wowed his entire audience in wearing skin-tight, tasseled gowns that mucked out a backpack, while wearing one hand underneath.\nBut with the new tone, the streetwear is becoming more sophisticated, comfortable and chic.\n""The French look is much more deeply focused on the black leather and T-shirts; trousers are luxe yet they don\'t feel like everyday-life staples,"" says White.

Two cups of tea still float inside our cupboards.\nWe immediately see that the party leaders have marched on the town of Arunachal Pradesh.\nUnimaginable queues of people are waiting for our bus in the main town of Kysaungyapagar, Naang.\nWhen the famous lyricist’s name is Taslima, we are moved to tuck our bare feet on board the stroller that we head down to the town center.\nWhen we join the caravan, we are then told that we are seats of national politics.\nWe fly on the bus and take seats in the back.\nA wall is placed up in front of the bus and we sit down in the lane next to the lines for first, second and third seats.\nOn the ramp, all the lanes are lined with colours and the victors will be able to vote for their party in the round of the election.\nEach of us then has the opportunity to vote for a candidate of either the BJP or the Congress party or there will be two lists made for our candidates.\nIn each seat, each party also has to vote for its nominee.\nHere we get the historic election symbol, a white blanket that comes up on the sides of the bus.\nIt has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with symbolism.\nIt is a symbol that symbolizes the ebb and flow of the political pulse in the state.\nA symbol that symbolizes the growing sympathy for the ruling elite.\nThe symbols they hold dear are strength, resistance, courage, kindness, humility and courage, evoking hope to move the country forward.\nThere have always been different political parties in this part of the country.\nAn apple tree in the northeast is a symbol of supremacy, rooted in the Rajapaksan tradition and a symbol symbolizing resolve and selflessness.\nIt is also the symbol of strength and resistance.\nIt is also the symbol of the resilience of the downtrodden.\nIt is the symbol of resilience, of hope, the symbol of hope that symbolizes the renewal of hope.\nWhen we fly on the buses we look at the bus as if we know in the dark, the buses they are.\nIn this bus we are surrounded by wreaths at the various events, especially the Bhagwan Chair Chair Chair, the coal-cannon chair chair chair and Chairy Chair Chair.\nWe are there to worship the task of God and also to pray.\nBy the time we take off we are one more bound to what the victorious party hopes to achieve.\nWe have visited four different events and come to know how they align with India’s political parties.\nWe see in them the formation of national parties, the leaders of the parties and the new leaders who will implement their programmes.\nWe read in a book of people, people who have been on the streets to change the colour of their skin for voting.\nSince the day it comes we must hurry and take off.\nIf we can make it in time we can complete the journey and get back home.\n— can agitate as the opposition parties are being kept busy throughout the elections.\n']"
421,The soft power impact of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's decorative collars,"['Imagine back in her early, impenetrable pre-U.S.B.\nIn her iconic California Supreme Court robe and spacious chair, Ruth Bader Ginsburg is hand-folded to one side, all three feet above the other with a sigh from the humming chairs’, a shudder of silent shouting all around.\nA crowd gathers with her, shouting “No” as they approach her for her speech, and to this day she refuses to get up.\nAround her warm, haunting room a crowd of daughters and grandchildren gathers round her, congregating to observe the little milestones she was born into.\nBut never minds, while dreaming of her daughter Mary’s baby, She’s as squeaky-clean now as she was when she was just a child.\nNo small house flower, she’s realized, is the thing to be to most women. And a new book called “Why Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s House Is in the MIDTOWN” reveals the truth.\nIn her beautiful cottage at a London train station, Rachel Sanders’ keen eye picks out Bader Ginsburg’s final voice, which begins with a heavy voice, the two-second tone she picked out for her.\n“I love black gowns,” she admits. “I look like she’s doing the Snow King.\nWhat do all those long, soft dresses mean?\n“They always look wrong. It’s so beautiful.”\nShe glows briefly, then quietly voice delivers a poignant eulogy — “You were all my spirit and I know you taught me to love you, care you, be beautiful” — accompanied by a gentle, spoken grunt of encouragement from her elder daughter, Mary.\n“I’m a little more inclined to get up and make sure everyone is smiling,” she says. “But I always start at the right spot — sometimes — and that’s where we have to be and make sure everyone knows we’re good and that we have good friends, good food and good times.”\nSo it seems, at least, that Ruth could both dream about the future and be a feminist.\nShe’s a scholar, writing for New York Magazine and a visiting scholar at the University of California at Davis.\nShe loved college, but she couldn’t find time to study. She wanted to spend more time caring for her growing son, but the best guy at the school was Bill — a trans woman who was barely in the polls.\nSo it made sense that she flew in for a deeper relationship with the man, in his late-50s. But Bill was not a millionaire, at least not yet. He stayed away from that plane because “he was so proud of what he did for women.”\nAnd yes, he also put on her beautiful plush chair. He liked to infuriate her with food and clothing, sometimes having her first inkling she was a widow.\n“He really, really liked my body and they liked my clothes. For me,” Ruth says. “And I thought, this is beautiful! We’re looking at you and … maybe, maybe, this will help us stay together in a healthier way.”\nThe two crossed paths in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as well. Ginsburg — the only one of her offspring at Harvard — left Harvard for the European Business School.\n“So at Harvard, I thought it was the smartest thing,” she says. “For me, this was what I wanted to do.”\nWhile at Harvard, she met Edith Windsor, a pretty but matronly “bungie chick” at a literary conference in France.\n“They were like two of you,” she recalls. “But Edith was a little more uptight than we were at Harvard.”\nLater, in 1955, when she was 27, Ruth said that she dreamt of being an actress at age 19. She said she dreamt of first starring on “Buffy the Vampire Slayer”, the show that was named after her boss, Fr. Ernest “Puffy” Rose O’Neill.\nGinsburg ended up looking to move back to England for a meeting with women’s suffrage activists after being cast as Frankenstein in the 1985 film version of “The Wizard of Oz.” She helped the campaigners seal the deal on a commercial featuring a woman holding one of her bouffants.\n']"
422,Why Beijing's Serpentine Pavilion signals a new age for Chinese architecture,"['Like a clear path to a higher order.\nFor the week of April 5-13, the Chinese government has put a palpable New Age under control, leaving the Grand Central Ballroom in New York City to its rear, a new public space to chart China\'s new urban scene.\nThe Belt and Road Initiative, which officially kicked off on June 23, is a massive effort to launch cities across Asia toward denser urban living and innovation.\nThat is because China\'s 80 million urbanites are aging -- moving from urban cores, especially in cities, to expanded suburbs and urban mores. These data can be a significant shift from ""modernist"" cities like Beijing and Shanghai, where new and redeveloped areas are being ground zero.\nAs a result, the Beijing theme park is much closer to suburban and new design.\nThe theme park is called Serpentine, for ""our new design"" and features a glorified glass terrace for elephants. It\'s open daily from 12:30 to 5:15 p.m. It also offers a ""Great Park"" -- which caters to Hong Kong, the capital of China -- that enables young urbanites to travel underdeveloped island-like islands for breathtaking views of the city.\nThe design is heavy on modernism. It includes scenes like bright blue tents and huge lights the size of around 2,000 ping pong balls.\nIts centerpiece features 52 stories of \'deconstructed\' tall skyscrapers (about the size of a basketball court) which are a source of modern urban architecture.\nImagine creating 200 or more high-rise contemporary buildings of the kind unveiled in New York.\nThen there\'s the Tower of Tsukuba, one of the tallest structures in the city, with 30 freestanding ""sinks"" in its tower. It\'s an historic landmark, one of only two in Japan that still hang as an ancient temple of the cross-hunting kakaburu warrior.\nWhen it was completed in 2004, it was seen as the dawn of urban culture, in which rich oil and coal resources, fresh air and raw materials are turned into urban scenery. Over time, it became a model of Asian design -- its ""houses of the 21st century,"" said Chinese architect Wang Yunxiong in an extensive exhibit at the Yangtze River Cultural Center in Beijing.\nThe size of Tower of Tsukuba? No big deal, as Liu Yunxiong pointed out. It spans 18-24 miles and costs about $32,000 -- which, no, the Guangzhou Studio had earlier mentioned during its time as the premier of theme parks. But that number is much smaller than what the Tower of Tsukuba cost.\nAs for the central theme park (called Serpentine Gardens), last month, the movement of the exterior of the 3-story pyramid, unveiled a distinctive ""MULTI-NOCKET"" -- a six-tiered structure that expands on the grid. It will be visible for 60 years, according to Wang.\nThe biggest design update is in the design and construction of the public and residential buildings, which is already scheduled to be completed before the end of the year.\nWang said that the new Public Square City is the closest city to the Serpentine that has yet to be completed -- for a host of reasons, not the least of which is that officials have suspended construction.\nThe changes will come at a great cost.\nThis summer, the People\'s Liberation Army will declare a regional championship football tournament, which will mark the grand opening of the capital\'s new Baseball Stadium.\nTickets for that tournament are already sold out, according to Wang.\nAnd then there\'s the sight of the grand opening of the 13,000-seat East River Aquatic Center, which is expected to debut in November.\nIt will be open through September.\n']"

I\'m tired of being so rich - the way we speak, where we should respect the body they have created. But this is who they are. And they feel like they have been picked up by an evil cabal and the creative genius of Russia, China and North Korea.\nI feel like someone in this room had pooped into my (everything this reporter had been given could fit nicely into one of the classic jeans. Why anyone would want a moving garment, I was asked - assuming my grandson wants to buy a high-street heavy for his birthday or some kind of weekend bender.\nWhat is important, I realized, is the money this stuff is raking in. I believe that what a lot of artists are making is produced in actual factories that they submerge, combine, protect and sell their products. Do you really think they\'d make enough money with a set of jeans to go home for your birthday?\nIt reminds me of the old thinking that told me you want to buy sneakers, Ikea furniture and, of course, tennis shoes to keep track of and distract yourself from the law of averages. He didn\'t buy any sneakers, I thought. He started off with low-priced ticket to New York, cost me about half what I was using at the station for casual shopping.\nNow he\'s building new warehouses to fight your next cycle of charges from income taxes and wholesale tariffs. So maybe he would be smart to purchase Ikea flooring and ship out pieces to West Africa, stop waiting in line and donate them to churches or help his rums set up a school.\nDo you want a fellow artist in this room who also I love to have my hand-painted art? Then that same artist could be picking up fabric and taking it off the walls and getting hooked into a story about how maybe poverty isn\'t just a violent situation for disabled people, it\'s a necessary evil to actually create work.\n']"

This passage is from his interview for Harper’s Bazaar.\nHockney and his wife Susan spent a year there in 2001. The couple had been living in Edinburgh when they bought a studio in London, when the lighting and decor of the couple’s former beater house became impossible to bear. As the building was turned into an abandoned studio, they were told they could afford to expand inside.\nSuffice it to say, the new world was already moving.\n“The edge of everything came to us,"" Hockney said. ""We did a bit of stuffing and then two weeks later, had to plan for the move all in an instant.”\n']"

The documents, a collection of the late Hollywood heavyweight’s family photos, share a love story through photographs. A reception for the collection was held April 1 at the Senegal Fine Arts Center.\nA snapshot of Gold, Pearl and other Supreme Chartug groups of Dakar later reprinted as “Images from Senegal 1974-1976” was made available to viewers at a free workshop on Friday.\n“To me the beautiful, second-screen appearance is part of the healing process and to me it can bring light to the world,” Gold’s son, Alexander Gold, said.\nAlexander and his cousins lost their only daughter when her necklace was stolen in the Baurant el-Boit region of Senegal in April 1953. More than a century later, Gold’s daughter was honored with a gold glove-esque necktie on an international gold awards program in London. When Gold walked away from New York to give up his own 20-piece play for children in the U.S., Pearl was struck by the tragic loss of their 17-year-old daughter.\n']"

428,How ancient Egyptian cosmetics influenced our beauty rituals,"['I am part of the humanity that hopes to build a diamond ladder every time I try to brush, chop or dry something, and that being a born beauty has enabled me to experience magic and the world has certainly become familiar with my mom. She’s the one who created me.\nI was born in the eastern part of Cairo. My mother had gone in search of the highest possible dry and hardy stones in the area. She found them in unique collections in Cairo including gemstones known as druithiths, and little metal fragments in ancient Egyptian ceremonial pieces. I was bewildered at first how to break through the shiny sparkling glass shards into gold-thumbed gondolas and order my grandmother’s hair to braid into one shiny gray blob, but by the time she cleaned me up and gently wrapped me in glittering sequins I was ready to regrow my features and add a fabulous shine.\nBeyond her forays into the world of gemstones and sparkling I had a spectacular vision of my mom’s grandmas at their wedding. First as a half-century old wedding gift, she said, “I will certainly give her another beautiful bride, that little girl, and my father will always be your brand name,” but despite the sparkle, the father looked at me with her eyes swollen shut. “Aren’t you lovely?” she asked. “Look there she is,” he replied. “She’s beautiful and I am going to marry her!”\nI see myself hanging out with the handsome, smiling gentleman that accompanies me on trips to Muslim temple sites. I see women in pink and gold rubbing shoulders with the men that side me instead of falling asleep at the couch. I see beauty in women like Tila de Larraga, whose amazing eye makeup instantly brightened up the eyes and forehead with the rubbery side of her forehead down.\nI feel incredible right now when I see makeup, mascara, bronzer and loose lips that reveal the bumps and brown and mottled breast, and even skin-tone scales from the after-dark hours of the beach. It’s hard not to picture my mom at the beach in the morning with another woman, drinking a glass of soapy water, floating in a bucket full of coconut and trying to scoop the rough seas off my arm.\nBy the time the surf came up, every penny was piling up, the river was pouring rain with smoke and rain, so me and my grandma were sweating through their hair and I stumbled across a gray island before the ocean moved into the middle of the tarp and I managed to cover up my coat and brow. I remember the rainbow logo boards on my glasses reading “Bulory Theme.” In a lull, I looked over at the tree in the street where the rock stopped so I could snorkel over there and help my cousins at home to reconnect with where they live and what they missed the most.\nSomehow, I found ourselves inside a safe room and realized that my Mom’s adventure was just going to live on. We could be cousins, grandparents and husbands and parents, grandmothers and granddaughters. Today we look forward to sitting in the cave on Saturday mornings where we can relax and enjoying our curls and see our fair cousins as I do.\nWhen I forget, I hope I forget and know there are so many different things that made my Mom happy, old and young. We couldn’t make this trip without my mom. She did a fascinating job of bringing elegance into her world, giving high standards of elegance to her workforce, their home and her home’s life. I loved being there and felt cared for and respected, but I would never forget why I chose to be there.\nI wonder whether today we will have the same kind of sense of community that my grandmother’s brand icon raised. Are there any ways we can feel more self-acceptance today and share our beauty experiences with each other? I’ll never tell them, but I hope so.\n']"
429,Vintage photos show the unsung heroes of the US suffrage movement,"['Things are a lot more complicated for the suffrage movement when you combine the silent men in order to get elected, while the unheard women were evicted to the housing market.\nThis week, one photo made popular over a decade ago illustrates the havoc that was wreaked by injustice.\nIn December 1950, during the second American Civil War, Democrat Ralph Hall displayed what became known as his “Un-room Law” to a window and yelled, “As fast as I can go and it’s nobody’s business who has lived here ’til late at night.”\nFor some, he was legitimizing the suffrage movement as it spread from grassroots to state.\nToday, that symbol is lost in the Vultures!\nThe vintage photos tell the story of the political change that happened when that Congresswoman saw a B, R and F going to the polls. Though she and Representative Mary Lousen hated the voting machines, they largely ignored what was going on in the system.\nThe election didn’t produce any legislators, both of whom voted “towards marriage equality.” However, the Vultures, or small towns as they were known, would use the machines to draw opposing votes. They gained ground in conservative states like North Carolina and South Carolina, as well as into Massachusetts, where African Americans still lived in a similar society.\nIt’s a powerful image, and shows an actual underdog after a fact about the result. Perhaps, even more powerful, it’s the speech, or the photo, of John Deere Chairman Edgar M. Evans stating, “Everyone needs to stand up for each other and defend each other.”\nThe suffrage story finally won a few states, and then another in Alabama that captured it for the first time. More than half of the state’s voters voted Democrat. And the story was helped along by these photos.\nOf course, you know that heroics aren’t universal, and that even the typical suffrage story is missing a major element.\nThe class struggle of America itself is still suppressed. Civil Rights and segregationists took it upon themselves to leave the country. The suffrage movement came to close the door to secession in the early 20th century. But after the Civil War, the nation was governed by a small group that ruled by Communists.\nMore recently, the Vultures, or small towns as they were known, would use the machines to draw opposing votes.\nThat was a watershed moment in American history, as that nation was one of the most active in social change in history. And in a short time, the suffrage movement brought about a revolution of sorts. Even after all of this, suffrage activists had to use silent men in order to find an answer.\n']"
430,El Helicoide: The futuristic wonder that now sums up Venezuela's spiral into despair,"[""It's at a distant middle-class apartment block in downtown Caracas on the south side of Petare avenue, where neighbors from the capital’s wealthiest families have started to demolish buildings and annex entire neighborhoods. Just days ago, Miraflores Palace, the sprawling neighborhood center that spanned the neighborhood from Central Avenue to Centro and beyond, was being used as the Trump National Football League headquarters of the fledgling Economic and Commercial Institute, or EEC.\nUntil this past week, it was a fixture in the neighborhood’s nightlife: a sprawling array of cafe, bar, nightclub, movie theater, impromptu nightclub, and the world’s tallest roof over the South Barraza Boulevard to the right.\nBut the Alameda was soon headed for an even further odder frontier: Venezuela’s newest capital, at the highly trafficked intersection of Petare and Carrillo.\nSo, on Wednesday, the city’s Planning Commission and Valor Development Agency began enforcing an ordinance mandating that any buildings being demolished, or an annex or control in one of the adjacent neighborhoods, be no more than occupied and recoup all of the cost with no profit.\nThe legislation, passed with the council’s approval and then briefly approved in a meeting attended by representatives of the Venezuelan Red Cross and Medical Society, is now going to the National Council of Municipalities and most of the elderly.\nBut I like what I’m seeing: Giant dusting clouds of dust, which would, in this new era of desertification, make living as normal as the market would, and my friends at the Keyboard Baglaw have given a concrete forecast for the next two decades:\n“The Rubicon at the intersection of Telesallu and the Barraza is a bright, vibrant community,” said the woman from the community, Stephanie Bowers. “The new rules are already forcing us to move into mass demolitions. When the plans begin to come out, they will start demolishing people’s doors, their houses and even the families’ televisions. And of course, my friend who just moved in [from Dominguez] is still in a construction project.”\nAnd it’s not just people who are in hot demand, according to Bowers. It’s also high-profile citizens from Caracas, El Salvador, and El Salvador.\nThey have dedicated weeks or days worth of activity in the neighborhood to making the Rubicon’s wake up.\n“Just over the past four days, our partners in the project have been busy building hundreds of new façades, upgrades and rebuilds that make access from Petare & Caracas terminal congest to Caracas public buildings that also occupy the space,” said Banistan Valerioz, a nearby urban planner, who admitted that she received a phone call about her good-looking neighbors’ demolition plans on Wednesday.\nWhat’s even more exciting is that residents from nearby neighborhoods have been raised in this uneasy orbit: frequently bombed by crime, chaos and evil.\nVenezuela isn’t the first country in which neighbors have tried to break up families or families have tried to build new ones.\nIn 2013, some cities developed a three-part plan where one wall of regulation were to be temporarily erected, one wall used to be to prevent the building of houses, and one wall was to be erected to prevent the demolition of trees and other delicate fields, to ensure a stable environment for farmers and the rest of the building-and-developing country.\nWhich is precisely what Venezuelan residents are demanding.\nThousands marched and chanted with the demolition of neighborhood homes in Caracas. But in Caracas, they were only one part of a bigger plan that promises to push the neighborhoods like plague – illegal structures, scaring off or breaking up residents, especially homeless people.\nWithout a sense of direction, the neighbors are left wondering just how important the new government is to their neighborhood, which is undergoing a so-called zero-emission revolution.\n""]"

And now the Federal Government is targeting people who have given up on saving for retirement.\nToday, young savers out of the way are young businesspeople who saw their savings and loan cards wiped out by the disastrous mortgage crisis.\nOver the next four years, the Federal Savings and Loan Association expects the same part of the country will get obliterated from the total economy, with a gross national product ratio of between 0.1 and 1.\nThe Department of the Treasury said at the time of its March 30th announcement that it was looking to eliminate 30,000 jobs to reduce the size of the FSLA.\nThe only time I ever feel like I have a mortgage is when my kids go to school, and I have a home that’s an investment that I own and didn’t in the past. I couldn’t afford it for a very long time.\nThe Federal Savings and Loan Association says its key goal is to help savers cash out their savings for retirement. This fiscal year, the FSLA will provide $50 million to S&P. In 2019, the agency will also make a similar $500 million program available to savers nationwide.\nBut the government’s actions won’t stop savers from refinancing their homes.\nIt’s almost certain that those who have borrowed money and are afraid to lock it up will switch to homeownership, instead.\n']"

433,The great shutdown of 2020: How newsrooms and media companies are adapting,"['Newsroom reform and radicalized “intellectual divide” caused a major shakeup in U.S. media when newsrooms launched their own “competent” attacks on conservative media elites, particularly the late conservative pundit Arianna Huffington, according to a new research from eMarketer.\nThat hate came along way after the nightly political news on CNN, a mostly left-leaning hub, more than doubled since 2001 and still attracts many of its viewers between the ages of 18 and 34, according to the study.\nBut it’s also just a bumpy road.\nSeveral months after the shutdown of February’s unprecedented internet shutdown, CNN cuts back to regular and nightly morning news, reports said.\nWhen it came to radical new thinking, only around 10% of staffers in CNN’s flagship newsroom added to that work year after year, according to data leaked on March 14.\nIn other words, six or nine years ago, newsrooms had no virtual presence outside the room at CNN, either if they did have affiliation with a real public television network or simply a “senior producer,” when the network’s actual audiences were considerably smaller.\nIn effect, the company was trying to replace its massive network of employees with “high-quality, targeted people,” according to the study.\nThe results of the study were outlined in eMarketer’s Economic Sustainability Update, an annual data forecast and analysis project based on numbers of companies’ products, services and products industry activities.\nHere are some of the highlights:\nWhile the topic “internet” nearly doubled from 2001 to 2012, less than a third of staffers in the company’s distribution force did so in the previous 12 months, the study said. It also noted fewer than half the employees in CNN’s newsroom consumed any news product in the past 12 months, meaning less there was in monthly decisions between newsrooms.\nAmong the biggest shifts were in the total number of people working in production, as well as in those who make their own reports, eMarketer said.\nIn the distribution side, fewer and fewer top reporters were deployed during the shutdown. More reporters at home made it through by spending less time working behind the scenes, eMarketer said.\nHowever, the ratio of corporate staffers to “deep royal patrons” - of which both editorial and employee salespeople are known - is also increasing, eMarketer said. “Since change is as much about staff and services, our findings suggest that change-oriented, heavy editing of short and long investigative reports is more likely to require post-shutdown operations,” the company said.\nOf the 82 corporate divisions that made up 83% of CNN’s distribution and production staff in the past 12 months, 39% had no people at their desks during the shutdown. That figure may have declined, but there were still 11,000 people at CNN’s main newsroom.\nSome studios had relationships that were devoted to researching conservative media like Wired, and some projects looked at ways to fight climate change, eMarketer said.\n“E-commerce, a vehicle that a staff member is mainly relying on to run most business, is becoming a trend,” eMarketer said.\n']"
434,How Fox News misled viewers about the coronavirus,"['CLEVELAND (CNN) — Have you known anyone that was critical of Fox News? Have you heard from people who loved to tell people how great they were? That’s the message viewers of CNN were hoping to get from a new “Fox News Sunday” talk show, hosted by Scott Gaffney.\n“I’m going to stick with Fox News Sunday,” he said. “There are six million new viewers a day. My daughter is watching, and she doesn’t know this. She wants me to know how Great — quite frankly.”\nThis year’s lineup includes “The Kelly File,” which Gaffney described as the “most beloved evening news show on cable television.”\nBut the talk show is just the latest addition to a channel Gaffney, a former anchor and executive producer of ESPN’s “SportsCenter,” says broke the “news cycle.”\n“The one thing that challenges that generation is, there’s so much instability,” he says. “With Trump and the same issues as the ones that I was exposed to growing up, this election, has been a complete disaster for my generation.”\nHe said he’s helping ABC pull in a higher-than-expected ratings.\n“We’re counting the legs,” Gaffney says. “Hopefully, this will help us get some advertisers.”\nHow Fox is misleading viewers\nGaffney says Fox News the network uses scare tactics that helped make the spread of the coronavirus, the disease that causes chlamydia.\n“A lot of cable news networks have spread this story and pounced on the chlamydia concern in the months prior to the coronavirus being declared as a public health threat,” he says. “They circulated a link to the ‘scare materials’ used in this past election cycle as a cover to scare the viewers away. The network put them on a grainy, sizzle reel.”\nIt doesn’t take long to find out what’s driving the measles outbreak, which erupted almost exactly two years ago when the CDC began screening people from affected countries.\nA spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control says a link exists to the virus but has not yet been confirmed.\n“CDC is still investigating this case and we don’t know what triggered the link,” the spokesperson tells CNN.\nThe Infectious Disease Research and Education Project says the virus “clearly” starts in the mucus membranes in the lungs.\nBut the CDC said in February that the diagnoses were made in the United States and that the virus could go into countries without tests proving it.\nMore people didn’t die\n“Chlamydia has been confirmed in 10 states, but that doesn’t give the virus a set-up,” Gaffney says. “I have no evidence that could be meaningful.”\nThe government says it detected one case of chlamydia two years ago, but there has been no official confirmation.\nAbout six weeks ago, the CDC told Gaffney that it had concluded that a case of lupus was related to the coronavirus infection, and he asked how we could have heard the word — the word wasn’t his and he didn’t understand it.\n“That sounds a little bit like not being on the same page as the CDC right now,” he says. “But he, in an effort to do the right thing, has admitted that it wasn’t his decision.”\nNot everyone\n“He’s the opposite of the people responsible for this,” says Dr. Raju Nayanan, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University. “Not everyone agrees that this has become a global epidemic, and that there needs to be accountability.”\nNayanan worked for CNN before joining the network.\n“If we agree on everything that we agree on, as CNN, and not others on it, then it doesn’t make a difference,” he says. “There needs to be accountability and there needs to be investigations and there needs to be content changes. I expect that standard and standards will emerge.”\n']"

440,One man lost his life savings in a SIM hack. Here's how you can try to protect yourself,"[""A man was killed when a bogus SIM card linked to his iPhone suddenly turned on and ripped off his bank account and then switched on AT&T, AT&T said on Monday.\nDangerous times, lies, fake phones! You could be hacked to lose your job. But how to protect yourself?\nIf you've been a victim of hacking your phone, you should contact your banks about two things: A bank is held responsible for the SIM card usage and a check isn't the only source of funds, AT&T said.\nHere's how:\nYou can get rid of any SIM-card modules that someone used, as you would if an iPhone. For example, if you have a couple that have SIM cards, consider swapping one on each you need to stay in touch or what the bank is charging for the SIM cards. More frequent than that, if you carry less than 1 of those with you, or if your phone doesn't show its three times normal speed, take the phone off a SIM card.\nWhile the bank wouldn't publicly say exactly how many SIM cards were used, a person's SIM card would still be valid after withdrawal.\nAll other networks are following the same standard as customers. The US Federal Trade Commission says it's an ad-hoc agency to track stolen credit and debit cards and trace the payments to an account. Google and MyCit is also doing this.\nNow that it's a viable program, you can try to limit the risk by disguising the SIM card as a mobile phone.\nUnder the US Copyright Act, a bank has the right to collect information on your phone and reimburse its customers. If a bank ever conducts that investigation, it is liable to have you remove your mobile phone, AT&T said. You should make sure the bank hasn't failed to conduct an investigation, and you don't make suspicious purchases unless you have a legitimate credit card or travel card. That doesn't seem like a high priority, AT&T said.\nAT&T says you can trace your phone to an account with the bank. You'll have to be specific about your possible account information in order to notify the bank of your identity theft.\nYou can also change your location, perhaps by getting off a Samsung SmartFinder, at AT&T's branch at KBM Bond in Savannah, Georgia. It doesn't make it easy, but you can receive payment for any transaction.\nThere's no telling how many you can swap SIM cards to another SIM card, AT&T says. And though AT&T is still working with Banks to determine if a bank will have to cover any SIM cards up front, it doesn't seem like you will be able to dispute where you're transferring funds from when your phone suddenly turned on, AT&T said.\nIf you're concerned that your SIM card won't work again if your phone turned on, you can seek a new SIM card with AT&T in exchange for a swap.\nThe bank will pay the money back as soon as the SIM card is recovered, AT&T said. But that might not be a perfect solution for emergencies and emergencies that can be caused with phones simply out of circulation or while you've been using the SIM card. It might be time to move the SIM card from a USB to a charging stand for battery power, AT&T said.\n""]"

It has operated for nearly 50 years at the theme park for more than three decades, when it has had “periods of constant problems.”\nAmong the company’s many parks are the Magic Kingdom and Disneyland resort, in addition to two Star Wars-themed companies, and the Bob’s Pet Car park.\nOn Wednesday, Disney announced it would shut its Holiday Train Station, which it’s reopened since 2011, between 26th and 27th streets, to “begin a reorganization process.” It left 19 locations open to public transportation and one 50-foot jetty at Disney World, where evening entertainment is now available as well as in parks around the world.\nHours will be scrapped in the mornings to give focus to all the ongoing festivities, Disney said.\n“It’s sad for a few people, but not for us,” Jill Morrison, chairwoman of the board of directors said in a statement.\nFacing a $250 million hole in its budget, Disney has grappled with the biggest problem it has encountered in its 30-year history. All of its newly built theme parks are estimated to be deficient, and many museums and resorts rely heavily on brick-and-mortar stores. Many of those stores were built before construction began, and that decision is weighing on Disney’s revenue.\nRelated: How We Became A Beatle at 36\nThe closing of parks also would mean that Disney’s decision to divert some of its development budget to pay for retrofits and other improvements would hurt its tourist count in certain Western markets.\nWalt Disney World, which opened in 1955, has steadily struggled since Disney first opened at Walt Disney World in Florida. It expanded through several acquisitions that paved the way for the company’s acquisitions of such European names as Disney and Pixar in the 1980s.\nThe company is now tasked with rebuilding its franchise. In addition to the Board of Directors, the company is also grappling with painful stock splits, advertising expenditures and new management teams.\nIn February, it decided to sell off some assets to give investors a choice. Investors who purchased shares were faced with risk of a $450 million penalty if they died.\nThe company is also confronting declining attendance at its parks, which jumped 11% last year. Attendance has fallen because many resort owners have abandoned those operations, according to a survey last year by the Institute for International Business Research.\nThat’s also a step closer to making it clear how the company’s working around-the-clock planning for its future will be funded, said the institute’s Philip Tenev in an email.\n']"

It found that items including trash and marine mammals like whales and dolphins have been running rampant in the road and sea in the area for decades, sparking concerns that millions of bodies of water and oceans could be filled with toxins.\nThe $1.95 million report recommends that QICL suspend all or at least half of its cruise lines that booked 2018 Carnival Triumph and is scheduled to enter the Yucatan Peninsula next month. New, full-sized boats would remain, the cruise line said.\nQueen Elizabeth II International Cruises Ltd., which includes Kingdom Of Denmark, was informed of the ban on all British cruises. Queen Elizabeth II also trains British ships on the Coed line called Queen Mary.\nThe Royal Commission issued its report in 2017, seeking more information about the number of bacteria in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and its fish and mammal network. What it did not say, however, was what came after the fallout from its report.\nFor example, QICL stopped all all uses of fish and dolphins, the report states.\nIn Australia, the government of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull confirmed that any vessels that use the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in Australia would no longer be welcome, but it had “apologized to ship operators of QICL ships” who had passed.\nQICL has previously reported delays for some Sea Star four- and six-day cruises to its busiest destinations.\nThe main criticism of the report is that it blamed cruise lines, which pass through the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, for getting construction work to this area as rapidly as possible.\nAlong with a few other cruise lines, R.C. Hammond of the Royal Tourist Board, said that the operation of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch would probably take around four years, but the government seems to have a desire to tighten what is now an internationally recognized hazardous area.\n“It would be an incredible debacle,” Hammond said. “I hope the Government of Australia will not change its policies, otherwise I think the scientific community will accept the findings.”\n']"
444,How to work from home without losing your sanity,"['Some of you may be thinking it might be fun to block out work from your busy life and stay home for hours. Well, not so fast. The Internet, we are here to help you create a work day that’s more leisurely and enjoyable — or that you’ll be able to actually enjoy — without worrying about your busy life.\nAt times, you might find this job is more stressful than you imagined. It also may be adding to the confusion of what works and what doesn’t. So when I asked Julia Roberts, now 42, to explain working from home, I was a little curious.\nYou should focus on building a day’s worth of productive activities for the rest of your day. Here are three key steps to ensure that your well-being is sustained throughout the day:\n• Focus on the ones you care about most. Doing your work well is an important component of being human. Even if it’s hard to climb a certain fitness level, the good things are often just finding the one you’d like to pursue. When your life demands it, do this by working on things you’d rather get accomplished and be excited about. Don’t settle for what you’d like. Do more than just get in the habit of thinking about the task at hand. If you do your job well, you’ll be satisfied with it.\n• Focus on your body. Work may seem like fun, but the truth is very often detrimental to your health. Think about your diet and habits of sleep. Put more exercise into your day than worry that your days could be shortened. If you don’t have a good day of sleep, you’ll be a lower-quality person in your sleep and you’ll be easily distracted. Leave time at home for things you care about. For example, washing dishes, cleaning out or taking medication for anxiety. If you don’t do a lot of people’s morning exercise — stop after 10 p.m. — you’ll take a hit from boredom. Try to pay attention to the daily schedule. Read and respond to your email until you’re ready to run from home and go anywhere. If you have a question about something you’d like to do, say it aloud. If you’ve come to fearlessly write down what you want to do, take it all down and then work on it until your mood improves.\nWhat’s your idea of a low-stress day? How do you know which one to try?\n']"

Neither of them asked to speak to me but I was told that it would be fitting for their law firm to be at Chick-fil-A’s headquarters at 350 2nd Avenue.\n“Whenever we’re talking about hosting a beer event, I generally like it to be more informal,” Unger said.\nI called Chick-fil-A to ask why this happened. According to the restaurant’s franchise policy, no such event is held in the hospitality industry. That policy stipulates “appointments and frequency on event events only, and includes the hospitality industry only.”\nBut a decade of the truth about the event became a compelling experience to readers of this article. According to “Katie Appleby,” Chick-fil-A’s representative, the event’s success explains its disregard for the rules of hospitality — including whether the restaurant deems it “the most respected” for a couple people.\nAppleby, who worked at Chick-fil-A for three years, spoke with CNN and agreed to host an evening’s conference table with Unger and Woo, a New York-based company. “It was my passion to become a professionally run hotel company and run a restaurant,” Appleby said.\nUnger said having a law firm handle the event amounted to a discussion with Appleby, in which the issues surrounding the event were addressed.\n“It’s great to be able to be at a place where our client can come out and say that they wanted to find a way to be there and something that made a real difference in their life,” Unger said.\nFor Eck, the experience was as much about getting to know the company for the first time as how the policy changed.\n“It was refreshing,” Eck said of being able to have a relationship with a business he’s been involved with for five years, which includes raising a toddler. Eck, who works for the firm’s New York office, is a tech consultant at the moment, and worked there two years.\nHe and Woo spoke privately, and only at some staff meetings.\nThe policy changed after the idea took shape — this is for the first time Chick-fil-A is accepting drinks and catering from these people. Today, the company expects the eventual, 4,000-ounce menu item to fall under the “family-friendly business” category. At the same time, reviews of the menu have started to improve.\n“There’s a brand backlash,” Eck said. He’s annoyed about “any time a company talks about certain things and they’re a little softer.”\nFor Eck, the plan now is to take a chat — he’s a pizza pizza guy and he usually does it all day. The chain currently has 350 “action rooms” in an effort to make pizza look nice and meet new people.\n']"

448,Dunkin' will give out free donuts every Friday this month,"['If you’re a fan of doughnuts, The Dunkin’ Donuts are offering a chance to win free donuts every Friday starting at 3 p.m. on Thursday, April 13.\nThe store has put out a special kids’ menu, that includes donuts, Starbucks and Dunkin’. (Warning: Snacks contain “seizure-inducing” preservatives.)\nWe spoke with corporate reps from the store about how this promotion will work.\nHow would you like to make your Donuts think sweeter?\nFirst of all, by distributing orange cones – the favorite combo of the two working to power up doughnuts – in the open “GASTROP” aisle in the store, and then by “POLKIN” – the beverage you bring in as you pass the sugar. Where’s the sugar?\nIt’s refined. So it’s in the gelato – the roller, the marshmallow and the bun – whatever it is. In the very plastic case, you’ll fill up with jelly with jelly, the sticky bun, and then you’ll fill up the gelato cone, and then you’ll clean it up with blueberries and blueberries, for your version of the donut, I don’t know, your daddy’s birthday and the birthday rolls and the birthday cakes. Now try and bring with you the secret to making some piping hot doughnuts and frosting on the cakes – you know, dipping the dough into a batter and then doing these cool balls on the top of the doughnuts. And let’s face it, it’s not hot, and you really could probably do a work for 40 hours.\nTosh, you need to have these according to the store website. If you get a hot cup of coffee from Starbucks, Starbucks can put you on the 5-foot and above chair. Or you can give the hot cup of coffee to your friends and donut moms to use as a Valentine’s Day treat.\nWhat would you recommend as a substitute for your parents’ own cup of coffee and donut cake?\nFirst, for a nice, complimentary treat. And then just give them a genuine cup of coffee, and then do make a latté for them.\nAnd lastly, when you wash your donuts with water, you should replace them with lime juice, you might as well then recycle your cup. After all, in this day and age in this country that common cleaning of plastic is so barbaric. And what you don’t toss, besides the crushed cup of your kids’ birthday party, can be wet, and can create a messy mess for a kid to mess with? Now’s my line about it – imagine the rough nails.\nOk, we talked this way before (Chef Dennis Miller discussed it here), but given the fact that you are a pretty happy McDonald’s customer, these aren’t your kids’ toys.\nOh, I love that [added glaze]. I read some funny stories about people using their own nougat, those old, thin doughnuts – and they generally have plastic wrappers on the packaging, right? I mean, what exactly does that do? And what does it do? You flip and you end up with plastic strips on the bottom and on top – all this to collect, all that sugar where no flour, and no sugar. Now that has to be 100 times worse than taking other thang of the doughnut on top – I don’t want to be labeled as a fan of these, but what do you think about that?\nWays to be a professional pastry chef\nWhat are some of your jobs and hobbies?\nWell, I’ve been working in the kitchen for eight years now and I work in a wood fire stove. I’ve been filling them, which is exactly the way I prefer to do things, burning the butter, stringing those doughnuts together and creating these brie pancakes. So I’m a pastry chef – I could fill these up today and do pie crusts, but I’m happy that I have a job and I put my bacon on my donuts right away and they will look terrific on paper.\nDoes your dad have a plan to retire now and his business will be operating independently?\nI suppose, in the company of these you would take over the day-to-day management, all with the same goals – potential for profit, for the future, for the things he’s passionate about.\n']"

451,What is a bear market?,"['NEW YORK — This is a question that most Americans are asking themselves. The answer seems likely, and it depends on which way you take it.\nThe bear market has started out with a slight uptick, but it quickly rose to a rally of sorts, reaching an all-time high of 11.28 before slipping back to a five-week low in the early morning hours. And as the supply of high-quality stocks gradually increased, stocks rebounded — especially in the fine industrial and consumer stocks sectors.\nAnd this has not led to a long, steady, frothy rally. We\'re not here to rest on this evidence.\nWhat is a bear market? It\'s not just about 1.2% annual growth, as the Standard & Poor\'s 500 index appears to be getting, but also of roughly 0.8% annual rate for the past five years, according to a 2005 survey by the MSCI World Index and by my own calculation as a number of guru custodians from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nIt\'s based on the theory that every expansion in prices leads to further price declines. But we may look back at the record 2001 bear market as that one. The big-cap telecommunications operator Xcel Energy Inc. has been one of the worst performers over the past three years, losing over 90% of its value to the late 1990s and 2001 recession.\n""We are watching the drop in stock prices as a way to gauge if it\'s more likely that the rise in prices is becoming more like that behavior than something else,"" Marc Birtel, the portfolio manager of GAMCO Investors, told CNNMoney. ""All the big changes are going to come from the rise in the price of certain stocks and that changes the number of people who feel comfortable with that.""\nOne major reason this could impact stock prices is due to the fear of higher corporate debt rates. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve eased interest rates for the first time since 2009. These lowered borrowing costs reflect a desire by consumers to invest even more in their homes and retirement plans. Then they see these higher interest rates get pushed up by the credit markets, particularly those with lower-rate mortgages.\nWhile those higher interest rates may be a negative factor, the ""only rationale for selling stocks is a fear of rising prices,"" said Rick Jaffe, an analyst at Technomic Inc. in New York. ""As households grow more comfortable borrowing money to make purchases, they need an asset to buy back.""\nIndeed, the S&P 500 recently hit a 5-week high. With profit taking taking the market higher — folks selling stocks because the rally is too slow to grind upward — stock prices are being sold again, Jaffe said.\nOthers in the investing world say there are some signs that things may pick up, but not as quickly as some people may be hoping for.\n""Many investors recognize the premise that the current high doesn\'t reflect expectations,"" said Nicole Trimingham, the chief investment officer of North Shore Financial Group in New York. ""It\'s too soon to be a bear market. But when you have a so-called bubble-buster or bubble-gum type of event, you can do damage.""\nAs for stocks that took a hit last week, Trimingham said it\'s not enough for investors to own them because the down-cycles do not seem to have started. If they are able to survive, ""we\'ll know the fears and uncertainties have been carefully thought through, and some are still unforeseeable.""\nJaffe said potential gyrations in the market are to be expected, but he doubts you need to panic to know they\'re high-risk.\n""If people are still panicked, that could make that stock much more attractive for other investors and their portfolios. So your best bet is to put your money in stocks before a big downturn,"" he said.\nAnd that\'s OK if you don\'t want to make the mistake of buying stocks at ground zero for the next bear market.\nThis is the question the experts are wondering. How do you evaluate where your money is based on what happened in the past?\n']"
452,How facial recognition went from bad TV to Big Brother,"['What used to be called a ""Facial Recognition Showcase"" goes through a new phase.\nResearchers at the Kansas City State University think of the show as an experiment in how people can use facial recognition software to recognize faces.\nSince the program premiered in 2005, the vast majority of people who watch reality television are the standard ones.\nTwo thousand people may use the program for a while. But after it becomes available, most viewers will decide that\'s fine because facial recognition is made to recognize skin, ears, or facial expressions.\nThe program uses a recording device. It records the movements of a person from a smartphone, adding those movements to the program. The hacker takes control of the camera, and turns that recording on.\nThe program said this is the equivalent of scanning e-mails, making an entry on a page online, and then using facial recognition software to scan in the images.\nWhat did it do?\nThe \'Facial Recognition Showcase\' attracted about 5.5 million viewers last September, according to web site Beyond The Head Show.\nFive years after initial stars Bob Marley and Jamaican singer Jessie J came along, the competition for the most ""touchtyles"" was completely closed.\nHowever, ex-Smilting Lord Tim Robinson says the program\'s viral appeal got real traction this week. He created #FacialrecognitionShowcase within hours.\nWen at the turn of the century was the first non-local TV show to put on-screen face scans. The Canadian police force that was like that show noticed a knock at the door of a New York City apartment.\nRobinson received the required camera to scan into his nose, the motornet, and, after the game, his face was scanned in a flash, while presenter Steve Johnson played a ghost face in court testimony.\n\'Pre-match\'\n""I asked him to ask me if it was right for him and when I told him, he said that\'s crazy,"" Robinson said of the episode in Australia.\nBarbie Gordon, the show\'s host, is just making up facts in her mind and tagging the show that it\'s impersonating and selling. It features what she says are 10-minute previews of the game as well as important live plans to make sure you\'re standing alongside them, little in between.\nThe real deal with Michael Crayley, the game\'s commander, is performing the voiceover of live game participant Julia, who tries to spot DNA that could influence modern species, such as moose.\n']"
453,How a coronavirus 'infodemic' is infecting the internet,"['A coronavirus “has recently hit the internet, infecting almost 1,000 people in just over a week, experts say, according to CNN Digital News Bureau.\nIt’s not the first outbreak, though. Earlier this year, five people died, and officials still have not released the virus’ origins. But just this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said coronavirus activity for the moment was “in progress” and “far advanced”.\nFor now, though, coronavirus activity is clearly visible through the sky.\nIn a viral-like outbreak, it infects adults and children, often in the run-up to Christmas. And users of social media sites like Snapchat are so informed that they are often sharing their personal details like where they have been staying at, instead of direct medical tests or identifying where they came from.\nNonetheless, there’s a big difference between the two. Infected people tend to be sick in one way and treated in another. Individuals won’t be rushed from hospital to hospital, nor will they be diagnosed in a doctor’s office. The risk, at this point, is a little too low, because in the past, these things work out badly.\nThe main event\nWhile the coronavirus is not completely unheard of — a norovirus was detected in 2012 at some California beaches, briefly causing severe vomiting, diarrhea and possibly kidney failure — this outbreak suggests that children are not immune to the virus. It’s impossible to definitively say for sure — the public health agency is only starting to address the disease — but more and more people are becoming aware of the link between the virus and people.\nRisk is in the air, though: People have been identified as potentially infected once or twice in the past, with potentially a fifth suspect being removed from the picture as the public health agency sees fit. And the viral viral sides of the animal cannot be spread by mean-spirited, harsh doses of immune systems. It can spread easily through viral transmissions.\nSo, we can rest assured that the Global Warming Solutions Network is watching what happened and reporting on it. Not knowing who to trust, and don’t know which agencies are issuing updates on where they are reporting on the disease is as risky as the internet at this point.\nAlas, the problem’s still not totally solved. Though coronavirus officials are looking for signs of the virus, while doctors are working on more than 2,000 cases, they haven’t found evidence yet to support the notion that it is the cause of such a widespread outbreak.\nIn its study about coronavirus, the CDC described the virulence of the virus, with the company mainly attributing increases in infections due to the potential to infect animals and humans. But that isn’t the point.\n“There’s a terrific possibility that something more severe was going on, and it was not the lead element in the viral race,” explained Jane Whitlock, chief epidemiologist at the CDC. “The viruses represent a huge and thriving infection pathway, and that a lot of these factors play a role.”\n']"

Savvy shoppers taking your money for a second look at house displays. And then some seriously fiendishly interesting frocks are in their late twenties and early thirties that you might wish you had left in the ""dustbin"".\nWow. Those clothes by Kmart are so tempting as to pass for cash. Your secret is mine.\nAnd that brings us to a question that is often overlooked. What actually happened in the near future?\nWhy, yes, it could have been all good for you and me, according to a company that specializes in finding exciting, cheap (and still affordable) furniture.\nIn 2016, group photo label Auctions & Research I discovered that 79% of the average furniture price had come down in the past eight years. According to its website, fashion and furniture are the most valued and overlooked forms of furniture, with the exception of kitchens, which saw declines of 20% in the previous four years.\nIt turns out that among these 85% of items, people were less willing to spend money on stylish kitchen appliances and furniture that were already available through their holiday parties. Of those items, 80% were ""phrases"" of textiles and wall, furniture and decor that had been shelved in a bayside storage location.\nAbout half, it turns out, were ""alternative"" furniture, and 65% of them were, or simply wanted to be located somewhere that was reasonably priced.\nAccording to data collected by the firm from December 2014 through April 2016, Auctions and Research found that 84% of items in the market today sell for between $5,000 and $7,000, and that they had been available for more than a year when supply stopped.\nBecause many of these items had been \'upright priced\' in the past, there is reason to believe that if prices could keep going up and staying low, they might also be high enough for quite a while.\nAnd that, to be fair, could possibly mean that prices of everything in the market will continue to decline.\nStill, buyers are inevitably finding more important things in their Christmas-present lists than buying used, expensive furniture. In fact, almost one-third of our top five satchel recommendations, and the 15-17 items on our list have been items that had gone to storage, specifically where they didn\'t go out and had gone to more freely.\nOn another topic, ""distinctive"" commercial kitchen products may be what\'s behind the increased retail sales. According to Freight Smart, an idea which has been going on for over a decade, a recent panel discussion on ""how to connect design skills and digital skills"" at a recent tour of the home yielded a number of seemingly pro-labor products. These included, among other things, a 7,000 square foot commercial kitchen, a digital-art studio, a carved-wood flooring unit, and the Apple Studio on an 11-foot enclosed or flamboyant sheath, and the stretch-of-the-site custom-armed curators, assembly and decorative arts tables that were available.\nHere\'s a quick break into some of the items that seem set to make a splash in the next few years.\n(Source: Freight Smart, via Business Insider)\n']"
455,The best ways to get yourself hired,"['There’s nothing quite like going to the office to bust out the Swofford song. Set for seven days in a row until lunchtime. Again, it’s a great way to get yourself an early card-carrying supporter.\nA consumer loyalty program designed to help smooth the smoothing of your business appears to be no help in the field. At the end of the year, a small credit card company will place an “Agent” rating on the applicant, ranging from “good” to “bad” and making assumptions about people based on their personal taste in clothes, photography and music. Instead of a “red” or a “yellow” designation, with a “most trustworthy” label, the company’s staff will be tapped randomly in the open. For the freebie, you’ll need to pay $100 for an “Agent.”\n“[The] new money you’ll get out of this is available in the form of a low-interest loan from a lender at a lower interest rate,” explains Jamie Batson, agent and senior associate at the Miami company. “So that if you apply, you can grab it quick and cash in a little piece of cash.\n“This is essentially the same way you could apply for a credit card but with a more low-pressure ad.”\nThe principle is, Batson says, that the rejection rate is their secret weapon in the waiting room. To apply, they’ll call the lender at “home,” and within 30 seconds, through a trash or shopping site, the process seems to be smooth.\n“That encourages agents to stick around, because it means they know that they’re going to get to work fast and they know their ability to negotiate,” Batson says. “It also ends up being helpful for recruiters.”\nBuying a credit card every year for pleasure may make them feel good, but the good news is they can sometimes get you in the door. Photo: Daniel Brühl\nFirst-time job candidates are often reluctant to tell others they’re applying. Some are partial, and pose a challenge to picking a company or star company for the job, but the insurance firm that sends the applicant some hard-earned money (not to mention what they’ve been told on camera) isn’t going to commit all of it, since it does all it can to encourage this ruse. At the end of the year, after the company has charged you the “intangible” amount (the big boost may be the $50 token token) as the “nice” someone to throw in the ad.\nAssuming that was the case, it doesn’t matter how young your applicant is — just the small-ticket cost of networking has implications for the likeliest future chances to be successful. Firms can get their services out in as little as two weeks after hiring, so chances are they’ll spend as much money as they’ll get and retain the person they’re looking for.\nThere are the top deals currently available to turn bad names into high-potential champions. Be upfront about a potential employer (the price is $250,000-$300,000) and let them know you’ll be courting more than just their employees. Not only do the companies know they’re making a corporate investment for the ace applicant — providing half their ad effort are from people whose personal taste and instincts will weigh in on their particular case — it gives them the leverage they need to negotiate better terms.\n']"

But airlines are now saying the ban is too light, causing travelers to become irritable, sick or unable to communicate and others to complain.\nThe National Association of Travel Agents said they are encouraged by the ban but recommended airlines cut non-travel means and avoid using term carriers.\n“Air travelers should seek health care at air carriers with adequate coverage. Some carriers already limit the number of carriers allowable in the United States, as a result of a massive screening program that developed in the past couple of years,” NTA said in a statement.\nTravel insurer Aetna said air carriers did not exclude it because it helps others — including real estate agents — that are more familiar with travel insurance.\n“When connecting with a carrier with their network, you should ask them whether the plan covers microbes and other kinds of diseases,” said Michael Billings, Aetna’s managing director of corporate affairs for the business group.\nPassengers for and against carriers are now legally prohibited from using multi-junction types such as a travel insurance that is not applied to airline passenger or airline crew members — even those who have had medical conditions of any kind.\nBeginning April 19, the next phase of the ban will have to take effect, so customers should go immediately to sites such as carriers-only.com/travel or airlines-only.gov/travel to make a final determination.\nThe ban applies to airlines as well as aviation carriers.\n']"
457,5 things to know about the payroll tax,"['WASHINGTON (CNN) — Americans will soon pay a second year of a five-year payroll tax cut, known as a 10% payroll tax. The tax was first phased in in 1991 to partially reduce the wealth gap.\nTo read about it, click here.\nHere are five things you should know about the tax for 2019:\nIt’s the longest of the tax cuts, which was enacted in 1991. The government has estimated the tax cut reduces the value of the U.S. dollar by almost $54 billion a year by year three.\nIt’s not automatic, however, so workers who do receive less income will pay more income tax for their workers.\nBecause the tax cuts take effect from 2019, at some point in time, the federal government will have paid approximately $50 billion in personal income taxes under this bill, a figure called the tax shelter. That’s the cost of the tax in most states, and that’s also the cost of the tax in taxpayers in more than half of the states that don’t have a state tax shelter.\nThe 11-year record was 12.2%\nBy contrast, it was 19.8% when it took effect in 1995.\nThe Senate passed a law to lift the tax deferral period.\nBy law, employees in states with a payroll tax are allowed to claim tax deductions after tax breaks have expired in a consecutive year. Most of the people who took advantage of the program would have taken advantage of it if a sign-up had not been extended.\nEmployers will earn a lower personal exemption under the tax cut compared to the top of the range.\nTo read about it, click here.\nSaying “sorry” for it isn’t going to lead to higher insurance premiums.\nThe tax cuts are subject to a one-time rate of 39.6% based on the value of the U.S. dollar. It will remain at that level throughout the tax reform, which is scheduled to take effect on April 15.\nMany of the remaining deductions will also be automatically taxable and indexed to inflation, which should make an impact on ratepayers who don’t save enough to cover the government’s obligations for the $8.5 trillion budget deficit, which grew by an average of 0.5% a year between 2013 and 2017.\nThe tax law then also makes it more difficult for businesses to deduct annual employer-sponsored health benefits from their federal income taxes.\nFor the first time, the costs will be shared among individuals and the states, which will make a cut in the corporate tax rate.\nIf you’re worried about losing your job, keep in mind that this plan does nothing for middle-class Americans, who will receive fewer benefits and may pay more in taxes in some cases.\nThe number of hard-earned tax credits will remain unchanged.\nThe tax cut will also ease some of the capital gains tax rule.\nThe estate tax will be halted after 2027 for estates exceeding $400,000. The tax cut, meanwhile, will go into effect for most estates and will lower income tax rates for families with assets valued at $1 million or more.\nThose with more than $10 million in assets will still pay an exemption of up to $250,000. Those with more than $50 million will be paid a tax break.\nThe rates on individuals and couples with total assets exceeding $10 million will remain unchanged.\nCompanies will continue to be able to deduct other deductions from their federal income taxes.\n']"
458,Your coronavirus workplace questions answered,"[""If you started your career as a part-time student hoping to be a paid instructor and grad to partner with a local soup kitchen, you've been probably surprised at the number of job applicants who shy away from any discussions about workplace hazards. The workplace is about workplace conditions, pay, terms and conditions. Every time you're asked about the companies you were hired to help, you turn around and go back to school on the CV with all those jobs left to you.\nWe all know that there's something about the proximity of some cashing cash or home office that's really scary to some of us. So when we go to a place like Southern California's Orr Agency, there's an internal workplace hazard code that sets a high bar for safety. How can you protect yourself in such situations?\nYes, employers need to be vigilant if a coworker or friend is making you the target of an on-set threat. Thankfully, there are new safety rules being developed in California.\nThanks to the latest law you may be in too, to be even safe to work in the workplace. It's called the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 2007. The law requires that any interaction with a career operating operator – including video gaming, email or IM — constitutes workplace hazards. Some suggest a security guard and a cybersecurity guard. Others suggest hazardous areas for anyone to work in with an on-call manager or doodler.\nTo be considered a hazard, employers are required to make it clear who your supervisor or human resources department is and who authorized your to work there.\nWhen workers leave their jobs they are expected to have been doing a thorough and safe review of any potential hazards, whether it be related to the construction or warehouse work they have done, the medical condition of a member of the employer's medical team or the work rule that specifies a day that is required by the employer to leave. They also need to be able to be independent of the person or team that is allowing them to work in their workplace.\nOnce your employer makes it clear who authorized you to work in the workplace, you're legally protected from workplace hazards. You're not subject to workplace hazards like armed robbers or carjackers because you feel comfortable stepping out of their car after work and waiting for them to leave and risking your life.\nWould that someone had been trying to blow up your lunch table and ruined the lunch of your coworker, while doing a gentle, due diligence for your mother's pediatrician or home physician, and everybody else who had worked there just because they loved the company's name? Who would have prevented that. Just imagine your coworker, waiting in line, pulling your shoe off and stuffing it in his pocket just to test the results. Is that what you'd do?\nIf you were able to avoid hazard, while it would be expected to bring the company to the point of tragedy, you'd have to come clean about the safety situation to the manager, your employees and also for the company. And you wouldn't be required to have a manager or a lot of supervisors to help you navigate.\nThankfully, the new regulations in California state that put a requirement for safe working conditions on the books for most employers have been effective. You'll have to change the paper job look-alike act to become a hazard. And if you work in an office space where hazards are not cleared, you'll soon have a warning issued by the contractor to protect your employees and get them to change their job looks-alike act before the new law takes effect.\nWe're having the discussion ourselves. Can you imagine what it would be like if your coworker thought of yourself as a producer in a field that might want them to place a product on a newsstand somewhere if the small supermarket they were standing at nearby was the target of a mechanical or manufacturing job? Or how would that affect your ability to work your job? Can you find yourself the life of a philosopher in a field with a bad write-up of your job?\nThere are practical reasons to go back to school. The carbon emissions the U.S. emits can cause carbon dioxide production to skyrocket by 6.2 billion tons over the next 30 years. And lowering carbon emissions with carbon tax credits seems like a wise choice in the face of what we now know as the 28% to 40% reduction in carbon emissions from energy generation over the next 20 years.\nThat much wind and solar burning alone wouldn't take four thousand or five thousand tons of carbon dioxide each year.

The tool, available on iPhone and iPad, offers a freely available library that keeps library books and videos accessible.\n“Minecraft is a huge word of mouth type experience with a number of different communities and different partners,” Dan Koedler, lead developer of the third-party website 16BigBuild3 and a marketing guru at the company behind Mojang\'s hit PC release Minecraft Studios, said in a YouTube video posted on Tuesday.\n“Even though the words ‘Minecraft’ are out on the free app, it’s important to know that there is absolutely nothing for you to say about that book and it isn’t something that you should be using.”\nWhile there\'s certainly much better alternatives to the endless anthems of the world, most players only get ""closed library"" apps.\n“We constantly monitor the updates by players, that can prevent them from having their library back open, or indeed, support problems like weird rumblings if an app restarted a problem,” Koedler told CNN.\nSo why are libraries so suddenly banned from online play?\nThese are the elements that are known to be clunky and complicated and often disable library functionality. In addition, games aren\'t just digested in smaller libraries.\n“You know just by the basic flaw of the game that the library lacks massive amounts of resources,” said Poppy Champ, the founder of website Slippery Fishing. “It’s the holes and gaps you’re missing in the game that make it so very difficult to program that library to program the game.”\n“It’s a blanket ban that says that you will not be able to play on all your devices, but unfortunately it’s not true,” said Dave Hankinson, the product development director at Address.\nTo combat this problem, you can turn off folders, not folders, off all supported libraries. To do this, you need a second set of folders and screenshots.\n“Making a small substitution a few days later and a full library in the same image and location was probably just a matter of designing a little additional library that people could download and use,” Hankinson said.\nHankinson said doing that simply required combining two unrelated libraries, and the potential is there for long-term benefits that will outweigh any negative consequences if you accept the message.\n“If you can’t master the art of maintaining libraries, then it’s somewhat less important that you rely on positive forums where people share stories and look into the exploits of holes and quakes and other unexpected and controversial events.”\n“Most games come online and are sold for free, so having these libraries in the hands of friends is a good thing,” he said.\nWhile there\'s still some legitimate issues on the horizon, Minecraft offers exactly what you\'d expect for such a limited window.\n']"
460,Apple's massive WWDC developer event will be online-only this year,"['SAN FRANCISCO (CNNMoney) - A crowded Apple keynote Monday evening is the last chance users will have to wait before they can chat live with the world\'s leading tech company about its newest and most successful products, and how Apple is affecting people\'s lives on and off the iPad.\nAll said and done, and today, Apple is paying tribute to 9.7 million developers and small companies. That\'s more than 13% of all tech companies in the US and a lot more than the combined spending on digital advertising, outside advertising, of hundreds of thousands of businesses.\nIt\'s a point executives at Apple have made for years, and on Monday they described the huge fan base that is just getting started.\n""We need to strike a balance and sustain and innovate in this market,"" Apple\'s John Gruber told reporters. ""But we also need to make sure the ecosystem of developers, everyone on the platform, engages developers as we evolve.""\nDevelopers, developers know that iPads are the biggest revenue source, so it\'s important to figure out where everyone is contributing to tech spending growth.\nThat\'s why the shows at Apple\'s annual developer conference usually end in a speed bump last year, when smaller numbers of developers attending for a typical live gig show emerged unscathed. They cancelled altogether, selling out of tickets, other attendees started looking elsewhere or cut back on their efforts.\n""They chose to isolate the success of the incredible star developer ecosystem from revenue,"" Apple analyst Mark Gurman wrote in a blog post. ""For Apple, this contributed to a new set of fees charged to developers,"" he wrote.\nGurman\'s blog post contrasts the best of Apple\'s response to problems encountered at iCon in San Francisco.\n""Apple employees have sought the best business practices for iPad design — whether you like it or not,"" Apple\'s Sheryl Sandberg said on the conference\'s opening day. She explained why her company had spent $1 billion to retrofit its iPad tablets, making them more affordable. And she stressed the need for apps to be ""accessible"" without having to pay multiple people on a business end.\nThe Valley\'s sometimes fake interactive Apple parties seemed to work well, she said. But she added that the platform wasn\'t without some glitches. She didn\'t elaborate.\n""There are several Apple events within the year for iPad and iPhone events,"" she said. ""You\'ll hear more about these events over the next few months. But to date, a great deal has been made about the way Apple is managing various problems and enhancing the community. We\'re at an inflection point where we are working as a team and with our customers to engage and learn from them.""\nThough Gurman offered a suggestion to figure out if people were giving up on the iPad, or if they were running out of room for an idea to pop up with a better platform, anyone who has purchased Apple products is likely to be surprised.\nOne of the biggest selling points of the iPad has been its ease of use and safety. Apple released the iPad Air the week before Apple opened its new iCloud service to developers, and Apple chief executive Tim Cook responded by talking about how much more safe and up-to-date the company\'s main product is now.\nThough the iPad Pro is considerably better at making photography better, the Pro doesn\'t hold its own against what Apple is likely to gain by giving the iPad a stylus that can actually mimic a photo — but if the iPad Pro can help the position, it could make it a little more palatable to families.\nLet\'s say users don\'t live in California and live near Apple, which has new iPads in every market in the world in 2019. They\'ll be able to take an Apple TV and watch videos, chat with Apple speakers and use their iPads or tablets as plug-ins for TVs and more.\nAccording to McKinsey & Company, the lower-cost iPad Pro offers buyers a cut in the initial costs of cloud services. That, or it could cost anywhere from $200 to $400 less to $499.\nCopyright 2019 by CNN NewSource. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.\n']"
461,Finding God online: People turn to live-streaming religious services during coronavirus pandemic,"['You’re on vacation? The last thing you should plan to do is search for a doctor to tell you about your case, or turn to Facebook to find prayers and concerts before you die? And that is what makes people turn to live-streaming religious services around the globe for answers.\nThe trouble is, this is the 10-year-old Web-based Internet, and the majority of Americans are consumers of entertainment media, not religious services. (That’s a problem, because I used to play video games and watch movies online every day, but I hardly make a dent in online storage.)\nDetermining where to look for accurate information is a difficult process, and people increasingly are relying on live-streaming services that typically start in foreign locations and last from a distant family or religion. The examples here include the viral Games With Games, which has streamed live-streaming Christian prayer services at the world’s most-popular festivals (such as Saint Peter’s in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem and The Ghetto Visitor in Buenos Aires) and The Walker QQ Service, which also streams online.\nAnd according to The Washington Post, Global Internet Watch estimates that 34 countries have services dedicated to Palestinian religious organizations, as it reports. The figures are based on tracking visits to the services by 23,000 people worldwide, the online giant’s data shows.\nIt’s not surprising that such services are popular in some countries: Seven of the nine countries are leading Asia and Europe in membership in the World Internet Day for Electronic Religious Media (WTOP) worldwide, and 73 countries have applied, according to the report.\nThe poll of 62 countries came to Pew’s conclusion that 68 percent of those who are Internet users are religious believers (that is, they follow the faiths of others on the Internet).\nMore than half of those who are Internet users still participate on a regular basis – with 60 percent of younger U.S. Internet users — and the median age of those who are internet users is under 20, with 32 percent of ages 18 to 29 among them. But when asking people what religion they belong to, 25 percent of those older than 20 said “Christian.” There’s a strong sense of religious pluralism in conversations, and that two-thirds of those online use a religious site.\nThe data shows that the sites increasingly have come under increasing scrutiny – and has stirred new concerns about the digital sexting habits of companies engaged in sexual conduct in order to get or maintain youth demographic attention.\n“This is a huge, and obvious, concern,” said Mark White, a research fellow at the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research. “We now have to see this through, and try to make the debate for an informed one about how this is affecting all of us.”\nFor how long may this wait? The Pew report found that the U.S. Social Security Administration might see an uptick in the number of religiously-affiliated bodies affected by the RSVP pandemic.\nThat would make it one of the few surveillance strategies with upside. Still, it’s a big deal for two reasons: It will reduce the amount of time individuals spend looking for religious services in their own locale and reduce the potential vulnerability of religious sites.\nFor churches and synagogues, the political concerns arising from the pandemic leave them baffled. Even more troubling than giving a loved one a phone call is having him or her profile on another religious site.\n“I am busy here without any religion whatsoever to ask for anymore answers,” read a statement by the Solebury CT-Tower Senior Pastor Jane Scahill, who worked for the RCH Group for 21 years.\n“I feel like I’m doing it myself,” she told CNN. “What if someone from a high-profile Muslim cleric contacts me about an incontrovertible problem? Who am I, over my phone?”\nBy Amy Lafleur and Michael Grunwald, CNN\n']"

He told CNN that the Pentagon would examine the contract.\n“We are encouraged by the feedback that’s been received,” Kocher said.\nThe question of whether the Pentagon has appropriated money to the military has come up frequently at meetings of Congress.\n“I was quite struck,” Arizona Democratic Rep. Dina Titus told CNN. “If we’re talking about a budget decision between the U.S. government and the private sector, I think we should treat all military spending as public spending.”\n']"

A small cohort of young entrepreneurs, mentored by Silicon Valley co-founder Larry Page, arrived at my cubicle in the morning to start a nine-person crew. The first question I got is: why are you there? A modest, similar outcome than we had imagined three years ago, when I grew up in Winterset, Ga. In 2008, my daughter, Madison, was born, and we started as a small group of travelers - from the U.S. and Singapore to the London, Tokyo and Beijing - who wanted to explore the world at all.\nI watched as students started using (or as the media put it - borrowed) Einstein software to track their successes.\nIn fact, I was a part of a group that was started because it seemed like a huge, world-renowned company, capitalizing on the luxury and economic opportunities that were available. The group launched into an aggressive cadence: One of its main accomplishments was partnering with tech banks. Many of the professors from Stanford University and Stanford-based firms were also participants in a roundtable discussion, and I spoke with them about why we worked in tandem.\nI put in almost everything I could.\nI put in my time, wardrobe, hair and clothing. I went from yacht cruising cruising at sunset to launching the rocket industry on an ice tanker on a Gigafactory-sized ship with a bandaged arm. I worked out a letter schedule and raced with the radio to make the best leap possible to sustain the momentum built in the Silicon Valley days. I talked with my crew at four to five newscasts. I was part of a Twitter-industry contingent. I met customers. I met engineers. I built whatever I had on paper.\nThat\'s what I did. Because I knew that to understand the real challenges ahead and to continue doing as much as I could, I had to learn to work. On the runway, listening to those who had made a name for themselves and had sent thousands of emails that would get our replies sorted.\nAnd then there were the motivational speeches on the steps of the U.S. Capitol as training instructors, in a time where Silicon Valley interns had never even spoken to each other in person.\nWhile I was at work, hundreds of others began enrolling in massive open online courses, or MOOCs, from David Kilcullen, Google Ventures and early investor Jeff Skoll, all of whom I had been around for so long that I knew they had to be ready and prepared for anything. The larger, deeper business organizations, the STEM community and tech businesses in general were rushing to get their hearts and minds spinning.\nSilicon Valley veteran Daniel Heyman, speaking at Tech@Work, struck me as almost visionary: ""This new generation is absolutely prepared to take full advantage of the opportunities there,"" he told attendees.\n']"

The camera then records the distance between the view and the viewer in order to capture the scene.\nTo be held in your hand while watching a game, a compatible controller is included. This makes filming as a virtual reality experience experience feel even more immersive.\nOther clients include GoPro, Ring, Airbnb, Space.com, a tech company “reinventing the idea” of indoor space, a VR company “to play with social networks like Facebook, which provide a sense of what the virtual space can bring,” Cornish said.\nAs well, the new phones support a mobile app for monitoring, storing and receiving captured images and videos.\nAs with the way the real world works in- and out, bringing smartphones to the living room could be in line with how the makers are designed.\n“You have to be able to act quickly to take them,” Cornish said.\nRob Enderle, president of the Enderle Group, said the need for headsets to work together to form a “real-time experience” is nothing new.\n“There’s a lot of competitive focus here. They’re starting to build on some of the advances in the ability to work more efficiently on technology and VR,” Enderle said.\nBut the key to getting their software to work as well as on the move is more than just looking at experiences in the office — it’s building them as applications and services.\n“You want to be able to provide them with a unique experience,” Enderle said.\n']"

But what about when we’re looking at the future of the ride-hailing app and self-driving SUV?\nThe 2016 Consumer Electronics Show was full of talk about self-driving cars, but the biggest was the Internet.\nThe boom in ride-hailing services and driverless cars ended up siding with traditional car-less societies, where select members of a defined group of workers could fill the roles of driver and helper, with their own vehicles.\nNot only did self-driving cars end up being entirely feasible, but they all came with a price. For starters, self-driving cars must be able to change the vehicle’s primary positioning if the driver tries to exit, and more importantly, when it’s no longer possible for a driver to stop. That means automakers need to make their cars more efficient and maneuverable, even without seeing how well they handle serious traffic accidents.\nRide-hailing “experts” say that never-ending waits for emergencies and high crashes, even repeated slowdowns and stomach-churning lost flight times can lead to unsafe drivers. These advocates argue that providing safety for the public with an open road can be reined in by highly trained drivers.\nSo what’s going to happen if the highways and cities across the country slow down as self-driving vehicles roll in?\nThe popularity of self-driving cars has tapped into a larger long-standing shortage of decision-makers in the U.S. for the skilled position of executives at autonomous vehicle companies. First, these people have to show the public that autonomous vehicles are safe and often the only people who will risk their lives to drive them are people like myself, who I could be saved in seconds.\nThen, drivers have to convince their employers and workers that they know they’re saving human lives—in fact, self-driving cars cost less money than driving wheelchairs or wheelchairs with a steering wheel—and there is reason to think people on boards and boards are going to be interested in this kind of artificial intelligence.\nFor self-driving companies, Uber and Lyft are simply embracing the digital presence and autonomous driving trend they have built for themselves. While autonomous ride-hailing may make consumers wary, its partnerships with transit companies and self-driving schools are making autonomous vehicles economically viable and offer a bigger picture of the potential economic benefits.\nAnd through the improvement of public and city streets, it’s less likely we’ll be faced with the kind of safety issues we’ve often been saddled with at once, just as it was the precursor to the automotive boom.\nSimply put, the future of the ride-hailing market is simpler and more predictable. But, as electric cars fade, so do the idea of driving electric cars. My point is that these are the future, and it’s working.\n']"

It wasn\'t as stunning a one-year-old design as the metallic hood that collected property from out of town, but it was innovative.\nBy 2016, his burgundy appearance was already beginning to make a splash. Dozens of impressions were made to the ground in one day.\nTesla Motors Inc. CEO Elon Musk — a video gamer, supermodel, and godfather of the craze — did just that and stopped dabbling in style. He changed his profile picture to a plastic green plastic bag bearing a face painted with a smiling S sharewallah, a Bowie name for the first planet represented in the catalogue of world exoplanets.\nModel D limped along the desert highways in what seemed like a cityscape of cityscapes. Its look was unmistakable: smooth granite, undulating mountains, sunsets, and exotic-sounding tropical vegetation — across the surrounding valleys.\n""It was the perfect site for Elon Musk to go to, to submit a design,"" says Marc Tedeschi, senior market analyst at the Viral Marketing Lab at the MIT Media Lab. ""He saw potential in cars made from surviving wood. It is like the perfect building block for his new company.\n""It went to sleep an hour after it was found, and he admits it was a very depressing experience. He immediately went to hardware store and saw the crazy thing.""\nUnsurprisingly, Musk has been making business moves for quite some time. He sold a very impressive looking aluminum roofless tester car in his garage, he signed up for a $30 million credit line with Bank of America and kept driving the mantis-alien-head-with-beer can to do all the dirty work. That same year, he sought to build the first concrete slabs to be built atop the Tour de France mountain-top.\nBy now, Musk would finish designing a family of tengo-short-faced replica Mach-3 stun jets — tiny pegs that cost about $7,000 each — on his own, and then go ""outside the box,"" by incorporating oil-stained, metal-clad strips into his bottomless rocket.\nThe industrial development of the Tesla Model 3 went through several iterations, and Musk continues to scramble for aerospace funding, but his aspirations to hit the road were always grounded.\n""It was a horrible car. We were constantly checking out whether it was possible to have it at all,"" Mr. Tedeschi says. ""It wasn\'t what it seemed to be and how far you could push it.""\n']"
475,Welcome to Walmart. The doctor will see you now,"['Have you ever been to a Walmart, remember that unique place where you get what you pay for? Now, you’ll be able to order lunch or dinner out of there, and you’ll come back for a different experience.\nWill the retailer have the same, more convenient shopping experience for its customers that you get from a human being? And if so, if so, will you expect to find that you find it at Walmart more or less everywhere?\nThose questions have all been plaguing Walmart for years now. This February, the company officially went forward with a pilot program that requires applicants to pick a gift or deliver it (while not ordering food, it was ordered in the parking lot). Passengers will be able to order groceries at Walmart without having to speak to a human or navigate a kiosk.\nProblems have arisen all around since the pilot started, but let’s assume that Walmart has only managed to arrest some of them. The retail giant is currently undertaking tests to test whether use of the technology will cut down on customer frustration.\nThe safety of this type of service is one of the most important questions for the company, and for the employees involved. Walmart had to apologize to customers because of the pilot program, but it’s only created concern that they will be overly-drastic with their operations.\nWalmart is doing this to appease many people and in order to increase revenue, the company needs to boost sales even more. Stores are going to be smaller because they have to constantly emphasize their customers. And I expect this experiment to grow even more with millennials, and millennials seem to be happy with that choice.\nPerhaps most importantly, Walmart is still learning its lessons from its many failed trials with human side-pods. After all, the store stores always look slightly different and real life slightly different, and Walmart is still trying to hone those aspects as efficiently as possible. We haven’t seen them master that yet, but eventually it will come.\nMeanwhile, the new operation by Walmart and the technologists that will eventually onboard the pilot program are people who are going to carry the groceries, and may not be expecting to be able to get through the next few days without the computer being in your face.\nThe pilot is fairly stressful, and the testing has already begun, but what’s to stop the company from having to cut back on more than one service?\nThe people behind this experiment are doctors who get a lot of help from Walmart workers. They’re majoring in computer science, because they’ve never been a part of anything but their compassion and love for people.\n']"
476,New packaging and plant-based fish: How Bumble Bee tuna is trying to make a comeback,"['How Bumble Bee tuna is trying to make a comeback The tiny lightweight pink fish packed with fish protein, deep-fried, fried, stowed, get woken up and boiled\nThis gorgeous redfish is actually nothing like the ocean-level delights found in late-season baited tuna — but pretty little by Bumble Bee tuna. In a sneak peek of the campaign, the real-world Monterey Bay native shared the recipe on Instagram, not the real — the Internet, as she is wont to do — and will only be available in the pilot season of the Bumble Bee 710 menu, introduced last August. (Thanks, Grudge!)\nAfter a press break, Bumble Bee team members Charlie McCue, Andrew Dunlap, and Josh Samuelson ventured to the big-fish trail in Newbury Park, California, and recommended they bring the yellowfin tuna back to view for good. A customer picked a fresh meal that quickly spiked: The yellowfin is only about 1/2 cup or less. It was purchased as a general protein supplement and it is preloaded with protein rations, a vitamin and, of course, a fish protein. Go to www.bblbeeeti.com and you’ll see its beak first.\n“I was actually away from the web when we came here,” McCue joked. “It is paradise!”\nThe creative team behind Bumble Bee reads on the Instagram post that: “We’ve been to exotic new places like Mexico and Hong Kong and they’re all fabulous places,” that “When you visit one of these places you’re away from everything you love,” that “When you visit one of these places you’re away from everything you love” and that “Restaurants can be so hard to find, but Bumble Bee will be the freshest and healthy combination.”\n“And of course, it is actually, as you’ll see, cut”\nBumble Bee tuna is a prized component of a seafood stew. As part of the Washington Island Fisheries Center’s marketing plan, the food industry celebrated “Bumble’s latest invention and marketing strategy to further highlight its global appeal by promoting a new packaging and cooking experience designed to delight customers.”\nBelow, watch the video of Bumble Bee tuna here.\nAlthough chefs are quick to point out its larval and egg dish in articles about this weekend’s release, the packaging is littered with lines like, “They’re all lovely; wait, we’re all curvy fish, on this tuna they are actually fried; the wasabi comes through, crawfish makes a better tuna.” I’ve added Bumble Bee tuna fish protein supplements.\nAfter 6 hours, the Fish Food History is available for a fee. You can “Buy” a package online at www.bblbeeeti.com or call 215-978-8288.\n']"
477,BMW redesigns its iconic logo,"['BMW officially changed its logo from original 1962 in all those years of being a member of the supercar world, first as a member of the Baupost Group and then as a member of the parent company of the F1 team.\nThe past appears to have rested on a change in the work of VW to build out one icon while traveling the globe, forcing many other companies to make changes.\nThe model has been modified for a tastier hue to emphasize movement and reflections over calligraphy, and it adds a more contemporary look to its signature paint design.\nLike the Baupost Group.\nNewstix\nThere are a lot of changes in BMW, so the redesign may help ease some of the undercurrents created by the Baupost Group as it enters its first tranche of big-league design projects.\nBack in 2006, 10 years after signing a U.S. agreement with Audi, BMW named it the “Primary Line,” meaning “Voyager.”\nInitially, that phrase meant “The mission and the purpose of BMW is to, by and with the people and agents that drive vehicles, lead the society to a better future,” according to the company’s website.\nNow, the badge icon is not a flag, but rather a form of self-expression: a place for on-the-road experiences where customers would get to see and hear the vision and experience of their lives if they drove a BMW.\nAs such, BMW plans to alter the look of its cars after an initial update as soon as it is possible to get behind the wheel.\n“The main change to the BMW products in 2017 was to take on more, more and more of the car’s realisation, thus increasing the level of relevance of the product and its ownership,” BMW said in a statement.\n“Also in the past, this company had a series of brand changes that caused them to change further its identity and in recent years we have been shown in the most recent development cycle to change its overall identity so that it can be more recognized in the eyes of customers.”\nThe departure of Roger Hargrove was an essential shift, and a statement from BMW reiterated the company’s other decisions to focus on more technological aspects of the production car.\nAnother adjustment, with the introduction of an adaptive wing mirror in 2016, involved merging BMW’s signature features with the offerings of its digital signage.\nAmong the upgrades, the lightness of the headlights, for example, and a number of other changes, include standard body and wing tail lights, as well as a wider “full-up moonroof” featuring fog lamps, a more upright backview and a narrow rear wheel-drive.\n']"

That means that there\'s going to be a deficit this year if Congress fails to pass major tax legislation. That\'s exactly what happened with the Obama-era Tax Credit. Taxpayers saved a lot of money and ended up subsidizing those students with a tax credit from which to buy their education.\nAs the European Union will forever remember, political leaders are committed to passing ambitious policies on issues such as tax reform, immigration reform and the minimum wage. But the majority of these policies on the table have been designed with maximum rigor so that every meeting of the European Union executive is an opportunity to push those policies to fruition -- a requisite in an almost universal space out there for all nations to work toward a better world.\nIn short, you have to show your true character to protect you money.\n']"

At times they do, right when the time or transportation to and from the office has passed. Some things were always behind the scenes and not so much anyway.\nThat’s why bars have a different learning curve when it comes to drink fundamentals. During the late ’70s and early ’80s, bartenders in the nation’s capital and New York cities would shake hands and even out drinks, dance and chattered to “Dirty Dancing.”\nTricks like jogging or snacking helped drivers a bit and were a lot more fun to walk around wearing aprons. They even used the martini as a pedometer for that Southwestern flair.\nIt wasn’t just bartenders these days who were learning how to mix cocktails while bar regulars appeared to be holding competitions. It was a surefire way to go wrong with a drinks dish, too.\nWith Jack Lime and 3-Year-Old Snack Barries, bartenders learned the craft of mixing cocktails while they were revamping it. They became the heads of the business once again and made their own more than 200 cocktails a year.\nIt’s nothing new that bartenders learned what moves people that drink — sipping and dark chocolate with cream.\nToday, bartenders have to balance a drink with a name — it’s not exactly a term you can teach kids, but it’s the latter way to teach something new.\nSo is the void of drinks legacy drinks built for future generations? An analysis of more than 400 bars in the nation last year suggests it’s likely so. Every state has a unique cocktail code and bar culture has its own specific consumer quirks, but bar owners all made it their own, and it’s almost certain that if you were to move the bar to a new location, you would have seen these unique combinations and tried to make them or met them by the bar.\nIn fact, the top five recommends and recommends to bartenders for here is the appropriately named Soak Up Your Cocktail:\nMinimize focus on the barrel of a good cocktail and top the craft with a simple code, such as the Blender.\nTake a traditional cocktail, and build your own. This room is a mixologist’s dream. They’re not doing groundbreaking changes or changing anything.\n']"
486,Luxury floating hotel opens in Sweden,"['SELINSGROVE, Sweden – Visit the latest tourism hotspots around the world but venture into Sweden: the Baltic Sea (uptown).\nWe enter town at 23 by extension the Baltic Sea and National Park, hugging a meandering beach path at the intersection of the island of Salk, one of the Baltic Sea’s most valuable locales.\nThe city itself is simply breathtaking. Beautifully detailed streets weave along a full lined urban landscape, while the Stikonski Highway becomes a nighttime detour, a difference from the less sophisticated highway routes. A mere fifteen minutes away, you\'ll find the Riksfort shopping center, birthplace of Baanis, and museum Mile Nilsen, a site of historic art that dates back to 1000.\nHard to spot all those sights but there\'s no word on whether any of the city\'s stunning mountain scenery will form a fall casualty on ""Jupiter: Views of the Solar System"" (an elegant exhibition on the inner-city theme of possibly thousands of souls but no proven records).\nJupiter is an enormous mythological structure, a giant asteroid that is carrying a huge boulder through space. Once in space, Jupiter loses its way and passes through a cloud of dust and gas sandwiched between the two. We\'re not sure why.\nJupiter\'s orbit raises a canyon that chases the massive rock, initially lofting itself along the wall leading to a stone pathway so we ride it slow to avoid obstacles. But the boulders \'denigrating\' speed up the hill and support the rock, sending Jupiter crashing into Earth in what could be a tsunami.\nCome back, we\'re in deep space, cruising along a stream that\'s causing you ache in its center: a trail that covers three of the largest ponds in the world. One of them\'s is a gigantic mushroom-shaped patch of blue corn, a sign of a more aggressive Jupiter.\nBut when Jupiter breaks out at an elevated highway junction in ten seconds, a cloud of dust continues to cover its center, breaking the path and depleting the garden along which Jupiter stretches.\nWe head down the road, heading for the brewery. The Dutch owner shows up to his daughter, taking her grandmother to the bar that opens after he finishes his work. For some reason, she\'s the one who sends me her very own containers of ""Jupiter"": green sour cherries, a blend of ice cream and bourbon, topped with fresh-cut cranberries and salt.\nWhere your holiday well is set for Jupiter is itself just icing on the cake: the wonderful lagoon, home to a 14-story glass pyramid clad in dark ochre and palm trees, the immense river right on the banks of the lagoon and walking north to the sprawling Schließenmeisterhof building (which that springs to mind, but neither have been glimpsed).\nThe complex gardens have a myriad of cool sites, home to festivals, antique stores, botanical gardens, jamborees and theater marquees.\nLast weekend, everyone sold on getting back to the city for tickets to G3 (umu: Universal Spectacular).\nFor next week, however, we may need to share the nights out with all those rapturously alert friends who will soon become the Brits (exclusively asking ""Did you go to Stratford in the U.K.? Did you want to go there for food? What else does an evening do with food? Oh yeah, do it for the night?

You\'ll discover a woman named Betsy Young - the founder of a nonprofit that used the moniker ""Lock It Up With Paul"" for his alleged participation in an alleged mob crime - in a thread that continues to be the basis of the CNN series ""Stevie and Mike.""\nWhile Young\'s spectacular exploits are nothing new, there is something special about this incident that has touched everyone who works in crime. This is a Boston crime; a violent crime in a city meant to send more money and a message to society that it\'s ok to live and work and to not do your worst deeds.\nBetsy Young was behind ""Whitey Bulger\'s"" most recent efforts to tarnish a fellow known as ""America\'s Most Wanted"" - a CBS interview segment that followed his February arrest in Boston on charges of looting a luxury hotel restaurant. It seemed as if Young was throwing a wrench in the work of the now-defunct Sopranos gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger, who served 22 years in prison before being returned to the US in 2011. Young and her brother Mario saved the lives of most of Bulger\'s alleged fellow gangsters (their crimes were capped at six). But as The New York Times notes, ""the Massachusetts prosecutor\'s office and FBI raided Young\'s home in March after offering a 20 percent return of criminal proceeds.

489,9 things that will make flying on an airplane better,"['There are some basic problems flying in the airplane — cabin smell, probably. In 2014, an FAA representative sent us our first flight plans since the 777X.\nWe were on a long, busy flight that included an active passenger on board for approximately 30 minutes and the rest was just before the nose-rubber popped the cabin door.\nOf course, that got us talking — and some important recommendations, too.\nNow, why should you be concerned about your seatbelt? How about the seat, right?\nWhenever one of these contraptions performs great things, you’ll have a myriad of reasons to be concerned. A car’s driver — who takes in less than a third of the amount of traffic in a plane — can’t keep up. Even though it’s all in the cockpit, there are some inherently dangerous controls that hurt your soul and probably don’t help it at all.\n1. Your legs.\nShoving around arms that can bend them hurts your heart a little, but the chance of it making you turn into a 360 mask is slim to none. If you’re testing your legs out, you shouldn’t put them on your legs as much as you’re giving them to help you pull around your plane. If you can find something in your chest that makes you feel good, go for it.\n2. Your head.\nBystanders need to be reasonable and specific in their suggestions, and you need to take those safe measures. At a recent briefing in the Scottsdale airport, our Transportation Security Administration officer came up with an ingenious way to bring over a security line in advance of a flight. He pointed to a chair position behind your head. I grabbed my phone to make sure there were no guards at the right height — not two at least — so that we could see in advance that there was an officer behind us.\n3. The added weight of your cargo.\nWith a body load of tons and loads of bags, and probably hundreds of people flying in the same period, some people just can’t fit on the plane. Thus, a thick transfer material like the trunk lining helps lighten weight on the armrest, removing the weight off the flying inks and re-stripping it away.\n4. You’re all riding in a new seat.\nThe lack of bodies required to perform in an airplane is a problem, but the added weight makes it hard to seat more than half of all passengers, every one of them, on their seats.\n5. You’re allergic to oxygen.\nToo many people in a flying system allergic to oxygen. If a plane is forced to stop working before landing, that infrequency of food in the seats is a number that will be significantly reduced.\n6. Your behavior.\nSometimes there are passengers that meet the same kind of special needs. For example, an international student who enjoys walking to and from school. Or a person who’s good at yoga, but might want to know how to get out of a plane to learn how to express themselves, or a person who has inherited a form of cancer.\n7. You don’t know when you should stop.\nBasically, people who do well on their sick days get in trouble — but they don’t realize they’re going to be trapped for as long as they can. They never realize they’re made to fly by the government.\n8. You have a fear of safety.\nIf you are experiencing a moment of extreme trauma — a sudden knock on the door, for example — or when your job has become too important to you, if you’re driving for 24 hours, you are going to want to get out of there. Without a step, they’re not going to have what they need.\n9. You have to wear seat belts.\nIf you’re starting to stumble over yourself, part of the solution is to wear a seat belt, but the more people you have on the plane, the better. Getting them off the plane sometimes requires watching some TV — but the money is good too.\n']"
490,The best travel photos of 2020 so far,"['photo: auxpeolar.jpg\nLONDON (CNN) — These images were sent in the wake of the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States.\nThat includes an interview with French sociologist Jean-Louis Churin and a batch of French-Argentinian photos he sent to Trump Jr. Some believe that he somehow convinced Trump to support WikiLeaks for a secret ""surveillance"" operation, according to French journalists who have taken part in the selection process.\nNevertheless, those images should be of concern to anyone following the debate about the CIA\'s involvement in the 2016 campaign. That\'s the biggest challenge facing intelligence analysts, whose job is to catch journalists who might try to steal information or otherwise undermine those organisations.\nA trial-and-error process is where some have sought advice from France\'s existing intelligence archives, and it takes time to work around lengthy records. That can get complicated.\nCNN had twice asked for photos of three different presidential elections during this decades\' transition. No pictures were taken in France.\nThe resulting series of portraits calls to mind what may be French interests now.\nBy that, I mean how the elections might have played out as the time goes on. But there also seems to be confusion about the now.\nTrump Jr. apparently seemed anxious to show off his new comradery as long as it would ensure his future — and not a single amount of money. Whether Trump has a large inheritance on his side, he\'s very excited about the possibility.\nBy contrast, the most important photo on the right is of the corrupt mayor and his current heir apparent, Gianni Versace.\nOne of the president\'s ambassadors, Seif El-Erian, is busy consolidating his influence, which is seen as an antidote to the personage of Gianni Versace, brother of Versace.\nWho He Is\nPros, he may be a stern and fiery character of his own time, but Gianni Versace is a ne’er-do-well of an architect, whose biography is unimpressive, if not off-putting, as it seemed to a lot of Americans following the election of Trump.\nHis massive wealth is not seen as a revelation, it is seen as something of a mistranslation.\nImpressed With Gianni Versace\nSati Lucia\nIn full:\nHis Carnegie marten, on paper: surrounded by historians and lawyers:\nIn contrast to his Coronation Wife, which he described to the editor as “psychological” and was described as “corrupt and boring,” Gianni has an impeccable proclivity for losing.\nWhy did he propose to the Palais Royale with his mother? The cover page — commissioned from a magazine for magazines in which the owner worked, Gianni — was allegedly written by a Catholic nun, who wore a long dress for his weekly pubic hairband.\nOnly the “professionals” are mentioned, but Gianni already moved across territory with his idea of an investment banker who would become the future president of France and then of Russia.\nHow did Trump Jr. develop his worldview? By dangling the money to either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump Jr.\nHow did he aim for his communications manager to be questioned about his business dealings? By asking, “If you can make the CIA take a more credible stance on this, how can you convince the CIA not to prosecute you?”\nFavourite Hopperreits brothers\nThe 6ft 23in daughters were in an affluent London suburb when they were stolen in a burglary. A friend of the sisters told the Financial Times that the thieves read them the double-book subscription in the fine collection and decided on using it to buy a car and raise the alarm.\nThis is something that friends on the Isle of Wight will be keen to know, but with Gianni being is he inclined to think hard about that because if it does happen he is a political figure.\nRobinson and Tranter\nThe pair are a favoured combination. Robinson and Tranter used to help secure the transfer of Somalian pirate leaders from the country to the U.S. so that they could export their naval victory to Libya and also fought pirates in the Caribbean.\nBut the brothers are not happy with the U.S. presence, and they do not want the U.S. to stop from supplying the people of some countries and undermining their struggle.\nThe No. 1 goal, they argue, is to bring back the local coastguard, and to prevent the navy from taking hold in these increasingly tense seas.\nI mention that because it is not limited to marine species.\n']"
491,Private jets are taking off because of coronavirus,"['\nMost Americans now have trouble catching at least one or two coronavirus incidents because they can’t catch the correct one, and for some reason they’re righting that wrong, experts say.\nIn fact, another third of Americans, only about 2.5 percent, might have a breathing problem from breathing on a private jet, according to research conducted by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.\nRead more about this story from National Air Traffic Controllers Association\n“Conventional coronavirus testing conducted in 1990 is suspect and unusual,” said Robert Bianchi, president of the association. “The air carrier safety team is not performing ‘safer’ tests in its areas.”\nThe association believes it may have made an error, but not likely. The aircraft manufacturer has an Air Carrier Safety and Accident Assessment and Detection strategy.\nThe Air Carrier Safety and Accident Assessment and Detection system monitors aircraft based on air traffic patterns and the type of aircraft used to perform the tests. This leads to that first indicator: How fast is a jet coming? That’s followed by the speed at which the aircraft has approached that speed and other signs of breaking airworthiness and safety standards, Bobby Wolf, a spokesman for Boeing Aircraft’s Scientific and Technical Consulting Group, told CNN.\nSince 2013,, the number of incidents of an airborne coronavirus has quadrupled, from 3,961 in 2012 to more than 21,000 in 2017, according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. The average wait time for an air carrier to evaluate a flight is 30 minutes, according to the association.\nThe Air Carrier Safety and Accident Assessment and Detection plan is reviewed by the Aviation Safety Board and Air Traffic Control and Network Enforcement units and overseen by a school bus escort, Wolf said.\nBianchi said coronavirus cases appear to be occurring in mid-air but in “random” waves. He said coronavirus exposure may occur as the plane comes in contact with a traveling companion’s stomach.\n“Typically pilots look in first, second and third floor, which could be an individual taking hold of the seat,” Bianchi said. “There could be a body strain.”\nBianchi said this happens routinely in other planes used to operate commercial aircraft, including helicopters. The maximum safety level for aircraft is 500, according to Air Methods, an air force air-safety practice organization, which certifies and evaluates its pilots and pilots through questions about air quality and safety.\nAmong the planes involved in the largest coronavirus cases, both live and depart aircraft, are Boeing’s Q400X, which contains more than 50,000 pounds of melon, according to the association.\nThe flying party knows that picking up passengers who are near or within the “middle” of a flight, on a commercial business trip, has good aviation safety, but few of them know the fire that causes symptoms of coronavirus before they notice it.\nBianchi told CNN the airline industry is an effort to preserve “the risk that a passenger is going to die.”\nAccording to the association, more than 20 separate coronavirus cases have happened in 2016 alone.\nLast year, McDonnell Douglas, maker of the A319 jetliner, reported a 99.5 percent chance of an airborne coronavirus.\nA diagnosis was given to an aircraft operator who was 65-plus years old and was “extremely unwell.”\n“He went to a lab that gave him an aneurysm and detected a coronavirus,” Bianchi said. “This patient was evaluated and found with good standard care.”\n']"
492,A bipartisan Buttigieg effect? The people of this gorgeous island country say yes,"['Iowa, the land of beer and brisk northern Californian backdrops, must be one of the toughest places in the country to live. It’s also among the most famous, arguably the world’s toughest, with a plentiful number of people crowded around in search of a place to settle, work or vacation in the middle of the desert. But the truth is that “tribes” of writers and musicians who populate The Willows’ solarium have found a way to pass as well, its feel more accurately defined by geography.\nThe Willows is supposed to be a picolutination of the Ohio coastline, but many people do not know about it.\nChris Kotlikoff, better known for tackling real life issues in that late July sketch Trump’s life might unravel, about 47 minutes in, stood in the freezing rain as he reflected on the news about what “to do” if Congress won’t cave in to Republican demands, $4 trillion in tax cuts and a massive infrastructure bill. It wasn’t just a “who says, we shouldn’t do it” moment for Kotlikoff — he made one, too.\nHe played the president of the United States, insisting that Trump “deserve to be put back to work and make a difference in society.” In his video, Kotlikoff welcomes reporters to the space. He takes us to town, past a group of veterans living off houses. He has drinks — as the one there demonstrates with plenty of wisdom — and can hear them chatting in the gallery. They all are English, or likely to be, and stand a bit, like the bad boys, about to unwind, two of the sisters in the baby fuchsia outfit. Kotlikoff tells the crowd, “You don’t need to have a photo op with a special agent, or a shot of gold barks in the air — you need not need a photographer; you need pictures. So just — once you’re here, when you get to the other side of town, take pictures of it all around you — so if there’s anybody, you can point your rifle to it and if he does not, you need to ask.”\n“You don’t need a picture op to reengage in politics,” Kotlikoff adds, with his somewhat quippy tone, taking shots at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who reminded the crowd that, as The Willows’ host, Kotlikoff is the full stopover from politics.\nAgain, he’s a Canadian, meaning one of the world’s richest and most sought-after hosts. He’s a politician, and he’s got as much going on as he does at his offices. He doesn’t speak new slang, but he knows a thing or two about places that serve as a metaphor, a place that at some points reminds you, too, of a place you can return to someday. In general, he does at least as well with press shots as he does with video.\nAs Kotlikoff sits in on CNN, telling us how he felt about the weather, you might be forgiven for missing it. The sky with plenty of greening is an interesting measurement for the position of the sun in the sky (both, of course, if you ever take a land cruiser in this state), but what really matters is the place you visit. And the potential of being in that place might become compelling enough.\nA couple months ago, Washington’s Capital was heading in a new direction. Washington, oh, so awash in money and progressives, but it should be a place of optimism that the political zeitgeist could be swung back into action. A long list of new ideas is about to take shape, and big questions are being made about what’s needed to wake the country up to the political system being feckless. What’s needed is a half-rotten, people-powered approach to government. Not even all-star politics would be able to give it that realism. The price of freedom is going to come down.\n']"
493,Why Uruguay could be the world's next great wine destination,"['Jose Luis Luis Lavocel is the fuddy-duddy, experienced man from South America and creator of the 2010 bestselling Uruguayan wine ""La Carte de la Casa."" He is the author of several books, including ""Gretaÿ: A Rose-To-Go Makeover - A Beautiful Futures in Two Natural Areas in the Land of Eden.""\nBeing in South America, he explains the wine was born after his travels in Argentina for a while, while his father was on a yearlong trip in Argentina, and as a child grown up he had the opportunity to learn all that goes into making this particular wine.\n""As a young guy who traveled the world for an adventure, I spent a lot of time in Argentina and Chile while my father went to Chile, making the wine,"" he says. ""When my parents came back, we started making the wine in Argentina. It was a fantasy to see the wine as something that was very natural.""\nLavocel grew up a big fan of wine grapes, especially grapes growing in Peru, which he first visited at the beginning of the year and saw the vineyards of Tavecchio and Don Echoc, who both started this was their last. ""My father proposed to me that I should come and be friends with the young people who started growing grapes,"" he recalls. ""We discussed the decision. And we realized that you start the step-by-step process of making the wine with less pressure.""\nBeginning with an annual tasting, which he started with Tavecchio, he was introduced to some of his favorite flavors of fruits and herbs, like the red cherries and tulips of Mexico and pinot noir, and then a lot of the grape varieties of his hometown that he grew in the years since. After that he began to train in wine making.\nMuch of the food he made in Paraguay, Puerto Rico and Uruguay took some time to make and his love for the wine world and labels he learned came from his upbringing and travels as a child.\n""I remember the little sour apples I got from Paraguay and the special old films with Robert De Niro and Líros Peron,"" Lavocel says. ""And then I also came across a beautiful wine from Spain and I thought, you know what, that\'s my name. And I wanted to share with my family from it, that the scent of fresh cherries and vinaigrette would carry my wine to give a change of direction. So I started and started making wine for a simple reason.""\nAfter a lengthy, tasting of the wines, Lavocel made the final two bottles for his cousin to add to the family. ""Then we started to have happy memories of it and of sharing it with everyone, and of how it tasted,"" he says. ""And also of the beginning of the process, my cousin came and picked up his grapes and tried them. And he happened to be one of the great wine makers in South America, that\'s what I am seeing right now.""\nWhile it takes two years of competing, blending, mastering and refining the grape varieties of his native land to make these wines, he ended up winning one of the biggest prizes in South America, the 2010 world record for keeping food sakes. This is because he cut a special sauvignon blanc to account for the growing pours of Uruguayan grapes that started for South America, and used them in the recipe for making the Wine of Life.\n""He has created a brilliant wine that lives in two natural places, and that is why I will just as soon use it in my wine, and when I talk about my new wine to my family, I\'m going to try it in Uruguay,"" he says.\n']"

495,Japanese chef carves food into incredible pieces of art,"['After heading to Tokyo last year to exchange experiences and memories with Chinese people from my friend’s home, this year I’ve arrived to land in Tokyo and taste up to 30 different flavours of Japanese food in all different ways. From spicy rice bowls to sweet-scented dumplings to full-bodied Japanese burritos. What sounds like a long-tailed chapter of the culinary history of the land decides to come true instead, and is a celebration of regional cuisine and eccentric tastes.\nIn every case, there’s a touch of one place, or a large number of places, that match the cuisine very well with others. The Japanese restaurant that customarily produced a daily menu of their signature dishes. Just pop up in the tunnel outside of Mutoto Café and you’ll find it stretches out for a very long time. Here, you just have to keep waiting for it to be done, but it’s been such a long journey that we’ve all patiently followed until our meals.\nTallpans\nYou can eat all sorts of soup, tempura or shiitake mushrooms, sunflower corn, and traditional chili. Take out this medium as a tempting broth, and you’ll enjoy a smoky mime. Boasting a metallic pepper which echoes almost immortal Japanese building materials, it’s instantly addictive. Watch out for glass soup, which is served high on sauces, trays and spreads. Along with the endless soup tressings, this is packed with tasty vegan staples like sage, sake, olive oil, ismarin, soy, kola nut, egg whites, walnut paste, mussels, and surprisingly rich dollops of chili.\nShrimp tin\nThis single attempt at a sushi dish, provided by Merahn Capital, makes out well, allowing guests to find the right flavor profile for the various course combinations on the menu. Katsuji and Neri arrive in the table with Japanese bamboo skewers and canola oil and freshly roasted lean beef stock. The combination then remains entirely plummy until the customer comes back with an oh-so full-on horseradish sauce. This serves as a great backdrop for a series of tasty fried wontons. Follow along with courses that are half cooked and accompanied by three different signature sushi sauces that either incorporate meat or poultry. Staying true to the feel of one of these, it delivers on both, using whole steamed rice balls to our plate and an array of sauces and exotic local scallions. The complex depth of sauce is somehow unique, making you feel like you are missing something.\nCoffee\nI love desserts and this is clearly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Choose one hot curry soda, freeze it and substitute for the other. Put it on a fire and keep it on a lightly oiled grill for 30 minutes or until burned. This particular curry powder, which also includes spicy chili, tofu, beans, and red pepper flakes, is all right with Japanese food, so purchase it at the local bakery and I will not need two different beans (it’s not “blossom butter”, I’m still eating fresh versions of that common piece). The temperature of this curry powder is literally off the chain, and just like coconut water in the chemistry department, it stays on the burner for 45 minutes before leaving, so that it can take some steam. Another delicious option that provides plenty of nutrients for the mind: milk—our “O”. Not to be outdone, we often spoon it into our ciabatta (can I just say, fat? ABSOLUTELY).\n']"

And that\'s what this new platform we\'re creating is designed to make about 110 elephants, as many as a hundred of them, available for virtually any tourist to stroll in a single destination destination on the lush Golden Triangle,"" said WCS President Kim Compton in a statement.\nJungle Bubbles will be one of 22 cities in Thailand hosting wildlife parks across the Golden Triangle, which officials say is the world\'s largest.\nMost of the cities will be within two hours of each other, but visitors are allowed to wander through the vast complex in the wild around midnight.\nIn addition to the ropes of trees, bamboo tusks and a white barrel adorned with exotic and rare animal names, elephants will also make it a place of worship for visitors.\nAnd the elephants have to have had a healthy diet to support their daily lives.\n""What these animals are being forced to eat is going to be difficult for them to find food and other undisturbed, nourished creatures that are so nutritious,"" Compton said.\nPeople will also have to endure some new challenges to make it out of the jungle, without a full-blown tourist experience from the park.\n""People will come and enjoy nature while it\'s not real,"" said Compton.\nPeople who attend the park will be seated in the ""Jungle Bubbles"" canopy as artificial creatures dancing in the trees. These animals get to greet the visitors with kisses on their leftovers and also learn about animals brought in by adults.\nThe project is funded in part by a $4.3 million grant from WCS, which will also direct hiring and development efforts to sustain the three million-plus animals in the park.\nOne and all, the new identity will be given to nearby areas to emphasize the holiday spirit.\n""Looking around, through the different trees and in different ways, from destination to destination, the tourist experience will take place and continue to feel like a local holiday,"" Compton said.\nThe new ""Jungle Bubbles"" tree will be open on October 1 in selected places around the Golden Triangle. Those are open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.\nThe new attraction, a ""terroir with no wall, no one,"" will be complete in December.\n']"
498,Luxury floating hotel opens in Sweden,"['Sweden is the latest city to attract luxury hotels and limousines in an ongoing trend known as The Holidays — the massive generation of young adults flocking to Stockholm and other urban centers to stay and experience a greater range of lifestyle, from beach house spas to luxury walk-in rooms in a hostel.\nIn June, Carl Topelinka, chairman of Ederhovenor, was officially launched as the newest clientele in this category.\nTopelinka, co-author of a report on Sweden’s increasing number of corporate and luxury hotels, said that the Swedish industry is a major source of revenue for European companies. He said, “It’s a lot for the Swedish government to provide. We have more people in the city here than in the whole of Europe. That means the local government is contributing more.”\nTopelinka said the number of hotels in Sweden has reached a record high.\nIt does not exist according to Hotel Index, the National Web site of the Swedish hotel industry, as the central government hasn’t yet allocated legislation to plan hotel projects there. Topelinka said the sector enjoys “the development that it deserves.”\nThe Holidays takes place six to eight times a year in Stockholm and operates four hotels — one of which is located in the city’s all but exclusive area known as Willingness, which is an exclusive cluster of islands well designed for travelers. The three-story building is high in the sky, with 98 windows facing the city, each showing a brand new 13-story building perched on its roof, filling the building with handmade, open-air furniture.\nArchitect Ralph Anui, who leads Stockholm’s head office at Pekka Mecke — the name refers to the “semi-efficient stage” — said it is huge and sets a market high.\n“Every hotel offers a different experience in every room. Where many hotel websites would say, ‘This hotel is an all-inclusive, with beautiful views, friendly, tax-free,’ people would simply say, ‘There are three different types of hotels in Stockholm.’”\nOne can board rooms to over 10 rooms with coffered balconies, private gardens, paths and views of the river. The hotel also has an indoor courtyard with natural stone walls and a rainforest that adds to the privacy.\nIn a spacious apartment, Hotel Sstadstadø, a contemporary development village built in response to Sweden’s high youth population, has an on-site spa with eight cooling waterfalls that cover 7,000 square meters.\nTopelinka said Stockholm’s leaders are worried that a growing number of young people want to become commercial and tourism travelers, but another trend they say is holding back luxury hotels is the availability of so-called single rooms.\nMany hotels have unique elements designed to show off Swedish personalities — notably here in the 1800s and early 1900s, where the city was known as “The Realm.”\n“The era is saturated and modern and traditional on the center, and now really foreign heads of industry come to the area. There are people who come to do business in Sweden every year and they have great idea,” Topelinka said.\nTopelinka said senior employees are understood to visit the high rise in downtown St. Helena and believe everyone they meet is from Sweden.\nThe resorts are shown to have plush interior areas. Hotel Rocha has a bathroom beneath the blue-clad diners on the ground floor, staffed by chefs trying to replicate the welcoming vibe of the city’s restaurant scene. The hotel itself has designed natural wood flooring, matched by lush gardens and colorful carpeting.\nTopelinka said at the Holidays, Stockholm has enough hotels and resorts to support the same type of lifestyle as Dublin. This reflects the city’s interest in creating a memorable visitor experience, in a unique and impressive way. “But we do offer different things from the hotel world. For example, Stockholm is usually two-days away and Stockholm has basically a day-and-a-half, two-hour walk from your hotel. There are no Swiss’s — it’s just a bit slower, not very competitive in the market.”\n']"

But I am not going to act to make them lie.”\n']"

It’s an attitude,” Putin said. “I’m glad we can now consolidate this relationship,” he said.\nBut Putin also defended US-Russia relations in general.\n“We are an alliance which is not just a bilateral relation, but one in which our two national interests are always central,” he said.\nPutin said the present push for change is a recognition that for the Trump administration, the 2016 election was a classic case of the Trump effect.\n“The manipulation of the electoral system has been accelerated by people who, to a great extent, saw not only the election outcome but also by Trump,” he said.\nNotably, the Kremlin says it has reached out to its partners and allies to try to support the proposal, which Putin says is being aimed at hitting the “threaten” of the Americans’ expulsion from the United States.\nPutin also gave praise to Trump’s counterterrorism adviser, Michael Flynn, whom he says was critical of the US government in Syria.\nBut Putin found some of his praise to be rather petty, accusing Flynn of lying about his conversations with Trump.\n“I say very forcefully that, in the very first in the process, Flynn lied about having these conversations,” Putin said.\nPutin also questioned whether Russia had to pay for those sessions.\n“I find it perfectly clear that there have been exceptions.”\nBut Putin and other world leaders also accused the Trump administration of fabricating evidence to justify its crackdown on journalists, including Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn.\n“My explanation is that these were decisions made by the American administration and — such as the informality [here] — they happen to fit the worldview of the president of the United States,” Putin said.\n“Trump has exhibited in many ways what he has said all along the last few days.”\nClinton had said Trump’s repeated calls for the withdrawal of US troops from Syria last month “deserve the same degree of scrutiny as what’s happened here.”\nBut it was Trump’s campaign adviser, Rudy Giuliani, who said in an interview with NBC that Trump’s campaign had been “pretty inconsistent.”\nHe also challenged Putin’s assertion that the situation at the summit has improved.\n“Maybe it is the administration, but President Trump and the meeting in Washington may be better than Obama,” Putin said.\n']"

Clearly, the impending winter got to them and the children had to do the hassle, bonding over holidays that were close to Christmas.\nAnd with that, they had to satisfy a nutritionally low standard for helping kids relax.\nWill-and-be and its cohorts, New Orleans-based LeAnn Vogelbaugh, 21, and her fiance Alexis Nobley, 22, each face a delicate balancing act of challenging the chills or clueless parents who might be willing to sacrifice everything to help out their kids remember.\nThey have had to weather colds and flu viruses. They have had to learn how to eat. They have also had to navigate the first days of May. That\'s how it starts. The sooner they stay on to the first day, the easier it can be.\nChildren and teenagers with flu-like symptoms are good to start, Vogelbaugh says. And for the children, the simple demands of stretching and repetition will leave them feeling exhausted.\nA fatal outbreak in October of 2013 lasted six days, after the flu shot had helped provide a boost to the family. The CDC recommended that the father of a teenager be tested for seasonal flu. An antiviral drug is required if a person is pregnant.\nThe hundreds of medicated people with flu didn\'t stop with the flu. They soon performed their doctor\'s office visits and helped with the family\'s allergy cases.\nThey had to care for all the other symptoms of the flu and so did countless other children. When it finally began, the family was too sick to go to bed. And they weren\'t allowed to leave. Vogelbaugh says their hospitalization, as well as the dangers posed by the flu, are highly discussed.\nThat\'s why she\'s so excited about bringing home the kids.\nAnd even though the chaos in the small-town America has gotten so unpredictable over the past year, she expects it will continue to grow in the next few weeks.\nAfter 7 of nine flu-like flu outbreaks all registered through March, the CDC expects that number to increase this year to an average of more than 13 cases, Vogelbaugh says.\nHer group of parents coming together this week for the first time in almost three years to try to slow the spread of a deadly flu strain is hoping for a healthy reaction and also hopeful they can teach their children the flu\'s warning.\nIt\'s a concept Vogelbaugh\'s mother, Cheryl, thinks could be even more helpful for children to learn about when it comes to remembering the symptoms of the virus.\n""We wouldn\'t think that after every children have fever, they can start remembering symptoms and keeping up with them and keeping them safe,"" she says.\nIf Vogelbaugh, Nobley and a group of third-graders can increase the rates of catching the symptoms, it could be the biggest pre-school need. And it just might save some of the remaining kids from having to go through the misery.\nIf that happens, Vogelbaugh and the child-and-family of Three Wise Girls have two more children in the school year. They will get married after school in September. And when the woman sees them, she\'ll choose them for their wedding, not getting married.\nCopyright 2019 by CNN NewSource. All rights reserved.

511,Are cell phone calls on airplane flights inevitable?,"['Part of me wonders if a plane is a reachable phone call, or a well-trained conductor who can operate the incoming plane, rendering the application useless.\nBut if you’re planning to cross the Strait of Juan de Fuca by the time it arrives, do you mind or not making the call?\nPassengers beware. Although we know how important the use of airplane engines are to the safety of passengers, none of us have all the answers. Frequent fliers are sophisticated travelers, designers of the very things we expect to find safe. We are first-class people.\nSo, before you print your replies for a swipe home, simply point out your experience and your options.\nBe sure to use your category of filters in your correspondence. Do you not allow a plane, taxi, z, teh, camp, riding flat-roof, semi-gearless, pickup truck, bus, and express terminal to chat on the go with with the other passengers?\nUse your app to load data with feed, indicate size of tunnel, check status, and other detail. Open your contact list and should look up the flights to get a quick peek at our trip that you happened to have fun.\nExplain how you’ve been lifted from your seat during your departure.

Provide the passengers with the noise of your aircraft, not the sound of the train approaching.\nWhen you are hovering over the ground, as seen from the video below, say your seat numbers and the name of the craft. Hover the passenger or crew members over them. Get a reference book that contains the passenger names.\nHave the passenger bodychecked with an expert body supervisor before being dropped off. Don’t use any type of “coaxial” body belt like the ones used by some bandaid or body contortions to block air movement.\nChoose a long-handled safety sander and wear the “M” indicator, but don’t add to the passenger’s “L” and “R” values. Just prolong the period of suspension by removing the sander.\nSleep with your feet on the ground to avoid inappropriate touching. Drink a cold beverage for your body during meals, drinks with friends or with a group, and listen to music or a lullaby.\nPlace your card in your pocket, or pull it out or tie it on the back of your car when you enter the airport.\nHold close to your shoulder while walking to and from the terminal, shaking your hand.\nNever leave your phone in your pocket with an angle mark, which takes time to correct.\nAccessibility concerns\nThere is no way to avoid being connected when calling into the Federal Aviation Administration or land-and-sea-based radio stations.

512,"'Hamlet' in the skies? The story behind Taiwan's newest airline, STARLUX","['All aboard the Rebel Jet, a commercial version of the Russian Starliner, which could be tested sometime in the near future.\nThe latest name-change is a slice of Taiwanese, our largest carrier, whose unveiling at the weekend is even more intriguing.\nThe company is known for their standard fare like K-rates, and for bringing along carrier carriers like China\'s Dalian Airlines for the long haul.\nAs Japanese papers here are known, China is admittedly a flight shy of international traffic. Unlike most of the international carriers in its sphere, Z-Jet has come to resemble a civilian passenger carrier, courtesy of the built-in cameras that shoot X-rays and 24-x7 intelligence and medical imagery.\nWhile China\'s 10-year-old StarJet has operated in just 25 cities — well fewer than a dozen of the Vietnamese counterparts — it has made that feat less surprising with Starline.\nThey\'ve been flying up to Taiwan for one year.\n""The Starliner will follow suit in 2020, and perhaps 2021 or 2022,"" lead corporate development manager Wang Chiong told Euro Pacific Dispatch.\n""It will be for independent passengers,"" he added.\nWith traditional business tourism cranking out an estimated 35 billion yuan ($6.29 billion) in turnover annually, STARLUX offers an idea of how many independent travelers Taiwan has to offer.\n""There is so much easy connectivity. The Starliner fleet will be very easy to maintain,"" Shen Peng, IDFA head of airline business at STARLUX, told the Asian website.\nIt\'s the first example of Taiwan\'s aviation industry practicing entrepreneurialism — something just ever since the country\'s communist tsar was deposed and established the country\'s first carrier, INN.\nBut the AT&T deal handed control of the state-run airline to a private company, Altair, which was privatized four years ago. Altair let Starline do the selling and provides free flights, something only within the country.\nThe hope is a similar business model is set up in the country\'s next generation of carriers — one that uses video-ready equipment like cameras and eye-tracking to provide security to passengers in the security stage.\nAccording to IDFA, the pilot tax would be 43.3 percent, for a private carrier that\'s allowed to carry up to two aircraft (LJ 120) in any given year.\nBottom line: an entrepreneur from a hit show to get into the direct flight business doesn\'t hold together just in terms of technical innovation.\nThere\'s going to be more customer competition because Starline seems like a shareholder, compared to other carriers.\nIn May, China-based LJ has agreed to sell its assets to National Starline Holding Ltd. and takes over Starliner Group FlightWorks.\nNew York-based STARLUX recently secured a three-year carrier agreement with China\'s largest airline, Taiex Airlines. The relationship, which marks the first time Starliner has held a pilot pilot license, makes an affiliate airline subsidiary in the country the parent company of Starliner Airlines.\nAmong other things, STARLUX operates in China alongside Chinese carriers Neng Power and Guwahati Aviation.\nA Qantas carrier, Qantas joins the STARLUX fleet sometime this year.\nStarline Airlines has 62 domestic flights, with 116 international flights at the moment.\nIts international flights are operated by Hong Kong airlines Virgin China and Vosiors International.\nBut this isn\'t the first time Starline has entered the international aviation market.\nIn 2011, Starline launched its premium X-ray escort service, Starflight China, with an eye toward lucrative international airlines. It has since deployed a fleet of eight Boeing 737 and one Airbus A380 aircraft in passenger flight.\n']"
513,Copenhagen's new Metro is a thing of beauty,"['Officially opened on Wednesday morning, the Swedish city of Copenhagen is still in the throes of change, with its first metro system, so named for the sunrise fog that clouds shed after dark.\nThe first Metro will be Germany\'s most extensive metro network, which will be introduced between September and November 2022. A metro system has already been built for London\'s Heathrow Terminal 5, where the transit network will become the common link between the global capital\'s 5,400 international roads.\nDescribed as ""revolutionary"", the public transit network will be powered by Swedish-developed trucking technology, which will initially be installed on 60 meters in the central district of St. Alphege near the Darmstadt freight hub.\nThe Tube network, which has been rolled out across Europe and North America in recent years, will kick off in September 2022 on the Nürburgring station near Cologne. This project will see a transit system electrified across North America by 2050.\nNürburgring first opened in 1932 with the subway to Hamburg, but dropped fast, hosting between 5,000 and 8,000 train passengers each day, according to the station\'s website.\nSeconds after it launched, Copenhagen saw a significant drop in train numbers due to illegal train-striking and pass road traffic from ships.\nThe city\'s core neighborhood, Corklin, suffered the brunt of that mobility being transmitted via train lanes, with the stations routinely late as late as 1,000 meters.\nCopenhagen has long advocated for a regional architecture, through an international architecture panel, which successfully approved the Tallinn, Estonia-Germany-Russian railway line.\nThe mixed-use project will provide another long-awaited chapter in the city\'s roughly 50-year history. This was supposed to begin as recently as 2013, but is often delayed or overturned by bureaucracy, as the early design phase was engineered in anticipation of the state\'s launching of last year\'s Polar Ice Age submarine research vessel.\nThe digital art museum presents digitally curated works of art inspired by modern art, including the works by the late Andy Warhol, Frank Gehry and Prado. The museum\'s presence in the modern world is completely new; many of the pieces go through years-long reviews and are simply selected from a huge selection of past artists.\n']"
514,Mystery Hotel Budapest: The hotel designed for likes,"['This hotel is so clever and refined. It was built from the ground up for your right arm, and you might even be surprised by the interior. As I say in Berlin: Random, almost novel sounds are cool.\nThe hotel is in an old mine (the site of that infamous Pitzer-Tatovo massacre) in Budapest, Russia. The grounds at the base of the property are lined with bird-hole-proof walls constructed by American architect Richard Newhouse in 1967. Inside, however, you might see the interior: partly inside the windows, partly out.\nAmazingly, the bar area is controlled by a small, spacious front-rear sculpture named the Opera Walls — the window is round and entirely open to the sky, so it’s front of mind to be able to overlook the gaze of tourists.\nI found myself in and out the door in an Austrian Airport and took this beautiful train tour around Europe, veranda eating (in the center) in a lot of the most ornate European buildings you can imagine. On one, a glowing piece of, of course, glass and embossed with lines painted by Bartok.\nThe group came for a tour of the nineteenth century ruins. The starting point is barely visible to everyone with the smile on their face. The tour is a first for the Budapest Historical Tours company, a nonprofit organization founded by former tour leaders and poets and artists. Each tour is independently planned and takes approximately 20 people, making it an intimate experience for attendees who want to learn about the buildings in the center of Budapest.\n“We believe in letting people learn about buildings and their history,” said Joe Cohen, a tour operator with a nine-month project called The Axis of Rome on this project, who has led four tours. “It’s just a beautiful piece of architecture.”\nI hit the streets, sampling an afternoon tea made from ¼ cup of, well, alcohol. Not much is known about this hotel until it’s named, and more important, after my first attempt at moving to Budapest, in 1968. As I waited to take the train and for a cappuccino to be served, I noticed most of the building’s original columns were missing, and left a surreal and extremely brief sign reading: “The Budapest Historical Tours company, Founding Public Art Company of Germany.”\nI tried to get out of the way and stop briefly, but the train wheel kicked against the pavement. I had only that fraction of an opportunity to see the apartment-covered brick facade, and only myself. I wandered on to the balcony, a little bit out of reach for someone else, and then, while I was waiting to see if my pocket included a short, takeout plate before it ran out of water, I realized it had been brought about by a broken window.\nThe hotel, which I found in a dimly lit office and shared with more than one group, is carved out of wood and then old concrete. Even the top floors are surrounded by a glass partitioned by cottonwood. The section of walls that split from the main courtyard are both painted wood, too.\nEverything here reminds me of these buildings, and the details of each building and its surroundings. The pitch, view and ambience feel cool enough that you know you’re in a museum, but with warmer-than-concrete apartment blocks cradling each other.\nIn the almost two decades I’ve lived in one Budapest location, or in this or other, you discover some of the finest touches we’ve known and loved: restaurants, restaurants, museums, and bars. You experience some of those things in your own city, and you discover the charm and richness that more is than can capture.\nWhile Moscow is crowded, Brussels is busy, and the hotel is all set for a refurbishment.\n']"

Considered the birthplace of the civil rights movement, Budapest is ideally located near\nMarchesi and Kapble Regresie, a monumental statue of the emperor of Spain. Here, the mayor has vowed to\nprovide an affordable art, entertainment and dining experience to all, by creating Budapest’s signature cafes and restaurants.\nBuilt on the island of Baltic\ninstead of being annexed by member states Greece and Portugal, Budapest was\nalso occupied by Hungarian troops during the civil wars\nof the 1930s—in the country’s heyday the Allies occupied what remains of the Old World.\nThis is where the “Metro\nBates” embodies a classical Budapest allusion to the land’s heritage.\nAs the name suggests, the Metro segment of the place bills itself\nas\n“Budapest’s largest shopping precinct and one of the\nbiggest music hubs in Europe.”\nSwiss-style wine bar\nHungarian brookling\nRealize this—which will be the center of\nBudapest’s nightlife,\nPrime Minister\nMariano\nGorbachev was a Hungarian —often with his colonial (EU)\nera bloodlines and entrepreneurial spirit —. “Hungarian\nresidents would favor eating high and low in Bagti, a busy beach where roosters\npaddle naked at the roadside, at the city’s famous Conforaci restaurant.\n“Hungarian\nresidents would fondly\nmeet a modern-day Brahmin and grab a few beers at the cozy tavern. ”\nThe Metro serves as\nintended inspiration to street food such as kavkava\nand bok choy, diners can opt to watch konstantin Gebhardt’s hard-scrabble music\nduring a meal out.\n“There is a great European flair to\nBudapest and a picture-perfect atmosphere.”\nThe list of culinary highlights in Budapest follows the following day: a Budapest wine bar, now considered a culinary Mecca in the\nGreat Lakes and Central Asia; an arts-and-crafts shop, quickly recognized as the world’s first\nfusion of Hungarian handicrafts, courtesy of the U.S.-based Hebrew International Union; an on-going theater, of Vienna (9\np.m.), collaborating with the\nToulouse-based Center for Hungarian Studies; a\nnew & exclusive restaurant, in partnership with the prolific composer\nDomingo Lappi; and a selection of classical and local music; along with a\nconcept theater, a restaurant and museum.\nThe Metro is said to be in line for a\npremier status this fall with a\nnationwide television program from Mel Gibson called “Speed Racer\nLive + Quick! For Only,” which brings back a fall makeover of\nBudapest’s signature bar. Additional\ncultural touches include an open kitchen\nwhere\nLaleh Alicomondeh, the former star of the now-legendary\nGreek family comedy “Cyprus,” is being installed as a prominent\nspecial events space; a lounge, children’s theater and on-site nursery;\nand a refreshing dining area with spacious wood deck.

518,Azerbaijan's secret to long life? Mountain air,"['After several long bouts of leukemia, brain cancer and pneumonia, Jesus Diaz had a new medical diagnosis. A cavernous but noxious, 10-year-old boy’s lungs were leaking blood. His disease had widened beyond the outer walls of the wall and had been the foundation of his life.\nThe b-map from the Sixth Doctor’s Manual on Lung Transplantation identifies the secrets to the long life of black lung from research in the 1930s, which showed only lung clones in central regions of Italy.\nZ. Sebastian Welcel told TravelKeeper how he spotted drugs from a near alien world in the 1960s and in the 1970s with the help of University of California, San Diego aerospace engineer Charles Early. Welcel’s illness gradually died out in favor of an adolescence that allowed him to mix the pursuit of culture with medications to decrease side effects.\nIn the end, Welcel and fellow lander Chris Helene discovered that melanoma and lung cancer are not of the same sex. But that doesn’t mean they can be just biopsies.\n“That’s the predicament, in your life,” he told TravelKeeper.\nAlthough rumors about the secret help of cocaine suggest that cocaine power in sixties may have been widely misapplied during the 20th century to treat other diseases, Welcel says there was no credible cause for the buildup in front of some of his body.\n“I can say that indeed, it was not anything or any one drug,” he told TravelKeeper.\nIn the 1980s, a software engineer by training at Princeton University and Black Knight, who passed away in 1999, discovered that crack cocaine could kill tumors by coating muscle tissue with a different kind of silicon coating, which simultaneously was an alkali substance. The drug might have killed cancer cells in the cloned cells, but it lacked the same effect on other organs. It wasn’t available for use in cancer surgery, Welcel says.\n“So in some way these drugs do not fit the mold, that’s my main problem.”\nStill, he says, “Rigorous treatment from time to time is much better than a hospital stay at a dying patient, and often effective treatment,” Welcel said.\nReferences to genetic pollution don’t mean that a vaccine’s effects, too, have reached mainstream; do we really need it? Of course not.\n“You know, there are certain control techniques that give you the ability to give your own immune system protection over time. You’re relying on genes that support that innate immunity that feeds off all sorts of other organisms, whether it’s bacteria that test their sense of health in their bodies or worms that fight pests, so if you want to control your own immune system, you need to have good genetics as well.”\nWelcel and his friends Bruce Thomson, David Goulding and Neil O’Neill found the underlying secret behind cell death in the 1950s and 1960s. Their research allowed them to induce about 200 conventional tests in people with two illnesses each. Without such protection from smearing, Theologics found that non-experts could be mistakenly “born with the germicide of Salmonella and/or mescaline,” as colleagues called it. That much germicide was largely reduced.\nNot all cancers are caused by certain chemicals from other sources. But most tumours grow their tumours in cells outside of one of those chemists’ control centers, and some cancers that seem to fizzle out with a wash of a stem cell becomes a thousandfold tumor. For example, only two classes of cancer cells in the family that only grow outside of one person’s control center are usually found in person.\n']"

Those who fly in the Southeast and/or West Coast will see higher prices, with inflation reflecting higher fares.\nDowntown Northeast flight passengers - for example, an average ticket charge of $12.87 includes a free round-trip round-trip ticket and a free year pass to New York\'s Charles Schwab Center.

Jansen said Canadian officials will send letters to players informing them of the change, while an American technical director is expected to be in place for every Soccer match.\nPlayers in English, the most popular sport in the US, have to be checked at home for signs of foul play or bodily harm, while American officials will run anti-doping tests as well, which Rapinoe described as ""a whole game changer.""\nAfter U.S. Soccer\'s last international match in Toronto on November 23, 2015, Rapinoe tweeted: ""I wake up every day like, \'No, I\'m really sick.

526,Ohio governor explains why he closed all schools,"['Ohio Governor John Kasich on Monday decided to “work all year with the students” to close the schools until possible legislation to prevent “scheduling conflicts” at other schools is implemented.\nKasich clarified the move when he addressed the Ohio Chamber of Commerce.\nKasich recalled that he opened three different schools in the state prior to the 2008-09 school year. These were convocations, presidential retreats, and lectures for “unfettered access” by non-native speakers.\n“Our governor has decided to leverage all of these lessons, as he articulated to us in 2016, for the school closings … in 2014,” Kasich said Monday during an event at the Ohio School Debate Center in Parma.\n“If if you close any more, this one you will do,” he told the audience before switching gears and asking them if they supported closing any school or programs.\nFor nearly two decades, Kasich has pursued opening all of the schools. The only president who allowed those closures was George W. Bush.\nKasich didn’t directly address whether he still holds that view, but did say he continues to believe a closing of the school would never happen.\n“That’s all going to happen and even if it ever happens … in the states of Ohio that you talk about, we’re going to re-think things and we are going to re-evaluate the opportunities that are open to us,” he said.\n“And that’s what’s really driving us to have these choice decisions, the choices that we want them to be open … we want them available to everyone,” Kasich said.\nAt the April 2013 commencement ceremony for Michigan’s University of Wisconsin’s Paul T. Ashe School of Law, Kasich made clear that Michigan’s lawsuit against the state is a “very serious issue” and the case is set to become a hot item in the 2016 presidential campaign.\n“And if we need one more way, if we need another way, we are going to come forward to come forward and we are going to fight with all our will,” Kasich said.\nKasich said Ohio has roughly 30,000 law schools. Of those, he believes 67 to 79 will be hit with the statewide or statewide closings, while the remainder will be shuttered.\nHe explained the closed schools would mostly be closing school day operations, similar to schools with a larger campus, such as the Southeastern Ohio University School of Law in Saginaw, and many more smaller.\nAnd he cited the four-year project he had with Wachovia to purchase the principal’s and custodian’s properties and to take them out of office areas.\nThe state has increased capital investment for the school districts, and for the businesses that will be closed, Kasich said.\n“I also think our revenue was very much sustainable,” he said.\nKasich also addressed two of the reasons he closed dozens of schools:\n“One, there is less mobility. You know how there is with school days and there was a, I think, an undue anxiety about time times that children don’t have a second break that feels like they’re coming into full-time employment,” he said.\nThe other reason he closed 50 schools is, “Some schools just won’t be closed anymore,” he said.\n“And therefore our schools are going to be closed,” he said.\n“Because of the tuition and fees and other things of that nature, there’s not so much – there’s not at the school level, either. And we’re talking about really, really important projects that will build a successful institution, and there’s going to be educational programs,” he said.\n']"

When she didn’t answer, she saw the man in front of her.\nThat’s when the boy grabbed her, put his hand on her shoulder and then jumped out of the kitchen. She fell.\nIt’s the time when most children use these experiences to try to connect with their family or even to correct their own behaviour. Like a train rushing down a street.\nYet when an injury happened to a toddler, the good news is that the worst comes when a child and her family figures out that they do not have to be the ones risking their own lives.\nThat’s when the issue starts, not the child but the family, and that causes many kids to suffer.\nI recently wrote an article about two young children who were locked in the kitchen and told how their mother locked them in the kitchen because they were afraid, unable to handle the stress of the situation.\nWhy is it that these children are afraid to confront their abusers? They think that if they get the legal duty to do so, their parents may be powerless because they are too young and afraid to talk to their abusers.\nIt is common for a child’s family to be violent toward parents and make threatening comments to them when they have difficulty handling their own stressful situations.\nThese abuse stories take the life of all kids.\nMy story was heart-wrenching.\nThis child was only 7 years old and cannot read. She is critically ill and his mother has lost her job.\nWhen she told her parents about her ordeal and how her life is in danger, they ignored it and she was severely injured and wheelchair bound for months. Then she visited the U.S. and received a diagnosis of brain damage and lumbar fusion and subsequent spinal cord injuries.\nThe doctors began taking at least two or three of her measurements to see how she would be in the future. After months, their thoughts were good and they did take at least one more test and an MRI.\nI told them about her disabilities and how she was so badly hurt that her nervous system was no longer working and she needed brain surgery to start fresh.\nWhen the operation was complete, she became 9 years old and soon lost the ability to talk. She has visions and dreams and therefore has difficulties talking.\nBecause of her severe neurodevelopmental issues and subsequent spinal cord injuries, she is unable to find or think anything. She will often hide her emotions behind tears, which is an incredibly painful process.\nIt’s so frustrating and cruel for families to deal with such a heartbreaking story. I am personally heartbroken.\nThe reports from this event should be terrifying to everyone. I suspect if parents and the media hadn’t pointed out this, so many could have ended up like this kid.\nSo let me pause here to say that no matter what type of situation this child’s parents, their families, and the families of all other children, would be able to put this childhood story at the heart of their lives.\nI will be examining this story by donating to a family that I could do something to help, and I hope they’ll find their right now.\n']"

It is likely to reject the revised language.\nThe deal paves the way for Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim to step down once the economy rebounded following three months of austerity.\nCommenting on the specifics of the deal, a NATO official described it as “unwavering confidence” in Turkey’s ability to keep its membership bar firmly in place.\n“Today, I’m confident that the EU’s bedrock partners, Greece and Turkey, have approved this latest development of negotiations to sign a full-fledged project to liberalize the European Union into a truly free trade zone under two million strong,” the EU official said in a statement, adding that the group would continue to seek an alternative.\nYildirim has been ill since the two-day EU-Turkey summit on Friday saw the usually vigorous opposition represented in the European Parliament and others who led the charge to push his candidacy for prime minister.\nEarlier Tuesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said: “In the summer’s international community there will be a free movement of people; in the summer’s international community there will be not even free movement of people.”\nIt remains unclear how Turkey would react to what it sees as a violent crackdown after Prime Minister Binali Yildirim finally rejected an EU offer to host the 1 million Turkish hryvnia (1.3 billion euros) aid package.\nAkseddin Demirtas, the executive director of the Turkish Media Institute, said despite Turkish concerns that the deal has not yet been fully implemented, it remains a point of hope.\n“For the Turkish people, this is a potential hostage for the deal that we are seeking as a whole,” Demirtas said.\nTo try to contain the EU, Ankara had adopted a common language with the European Union that highlights challenges. But this would not have allowed for Turkey to negotiate directly with the EU, dealing a blow to its EU-brokered aims.\nRelations between the EU and Turkey soured sharply after Turkey blamed its terrorist groups for the chaos in the south. Erdogan blamed ethnic Kurds for the strife, trying to undermine popular anger for next year’s presidential election.\nTurkey rejoined the European Union as part of the 2015 deal but President Donald Trump opposed the move, insisting it will free up EU foreign policy.\nSince then, Erdogan has used his crackdown on protest and repression to seek the EU’s blessing on a group of rebel factions running a rebel coalition in northern Syria, threatening to bring war to Turkey.\n']"
536,American Dynasties: The Kennedys,"['(CNN) — Which three of America’s most famous politicians are connected to the National Security Agency? That matter came to court Thursday as prosecutors sought to prove that they were not just some ordinary citizens of the United States but actually were individuals associated with the federal surveillance program, whether or not they were already in government office at the time.\nFrom intelligence agencies to Congress, they are believed to be paying attention to whenever one of these little guys has entered a government service. The Reuters/University of Chicago report on Thursday alleged that a large number of young Americans recruited to join the U.S. intelligence program in the 1990s were essentially given “tactical protection” during their years at the agency — not as spies.\nIn 2011, while they were preparing to go public with their identities, a former consultant contacted an FBI agent posing as a middleman in determining how to secure a conviction for the CIA-led “black site” operations. The agent expressed interest in working in a White House security detail for former president George W. Bush. He claimed he was “a very reliable case study,” though the agent refused to describe him as a “smooth” and “an honorable man”; the FBI said in 2011 he was “not much more than another piece of paper.”\nA Justice Department attorney, though, never attempted to address the relationship between the former consultants and the FBI agents used to investigate his ideas. “There was no agreement or understanding of any firm that they were going to work together,” the attorney reportedly told the Justice Department. “At that point, they were not going to question the man.”\nWhile the two men have since cooperated with the government, now-defunct companies are at war over whether the NSA is authorized to spy on their communications and whether their communications resulted in personal communications (which they were not privy to), or should be used as hostage-taking tactics.\nThe House Intelligence Committee in February last year unanimously voted to condemn the unprecedented Justice Department probe.\nAccording to documents obtained by Reuters, the CIA-led “black site” operations conducted under FBI command oversaw plots for the CIA to hack into and steal emails, passwords and other sensitive information.\nIn “White House,” a note included in the indictment notes that a former intelligence analyst from Nevada, Jack Dorsey, who had served as the president’s chief technology officer, was involved in the groups when he brought up the NSA program while investigating presidential communications.\nIn February, Dorsey’s lawyer, Scott Reed, called the FBI’s appearance in court a “complete fabrication” and accused them of trying to “silence the public” in the aftermath of Clinton’s resignation.\n“What the FBI has tried to do in this case is to silence the public’s questions,” Reed said during a court-appointed recess. “It’s a felony. It’s a perverse irony.”\n']"

Pope Francis received the award on Monday, the most successful pontiff ever inducted into the hall of fame.\nDolan, who was an administrator and a bishop from 1974-74, before retiring, has worked as the pope\'s spokesman for the Vatican and government for the last five years.\nHe has a strong record of serving on top policy and other high-profile positions and has considered changing the Vatican to allow universal marriage among the group, a demand that would open up a new front in their fight against AIDS.\n""If you listen to the pope\'s comment, it is quite an accomplishment,"" said former clergyman and congressman Pat Toomey. ""He knows what everyone wants out of life. But he is telling people that that is a challenge. He thinks this is not the end of the world.""\nToomey was one of the staffers who focused on the push toward universal marriage.\nThe American Family Association, which represents about 250 evangelical Christian leaders, also lauded the pope for his efforts toward this goal, noting his role as a friend.\n""Many of his words have come from the heart -- the humility with which he addresses his age, his understanding of the scriptures, and his awareness of the power of the Gospel to help human beings to live God\'s commandments,"" said President Reagan\'s spokesman, Tom Albanese.\nPresident Clinton\'s Secretary of the Treasury, Mary Baker Eddy, also received the Kennedy Center Honors for her work in the struggle against AIDS.\n']"
538,Louboutin wins fight to trademark red soles,"['(CNN) — Danish metal grinder and electronic super fan Stefan Louboutin beat out the other three competitors for the coveted red soles at the 2018 Winter Olympics.\nThe 25-year-old Austrian held off the doubles team of Manchester native Shawn Sloss and German teaming stalwart Toby Kuhn to become the first professional male to triumph at a Winter Olympics.\nThe gold medal was Louboutin’s second of the night after he won the bronze-medal victory over Lithuania’s Yulia Yaggin in the semis. He also won the bronze in men’s Alpine skiing last year.\nLouboutin had his bronze medal in the men’s single-pine skiing moguls crash on a snowy piste at St. Moritz just a month before the Olympic closing ceremony in Pyeongchang.\nThe gold and silver medal in the men’s figure skating will play a big role for this year’s Winter Olympics when the three medalists are announced in early October.\nLouboutin received an update on his progress on Thursday, tweeting out “most important time” after he’d raced his first road race of the season on Friday.\n“I think my first practice victory was probably around 3:40 p.m. in the morning,” Louboutin told the Munich-based newspaper Darmstadt Zeitung. “And by the third quarter I had broken my neck.”\nOn Wednesday, the 30-year-old tweeted out a “thank you” to world championships medalist Jonas Hojn at the Rosa Khutor Alpine Center in February.\n“Thank you to the Russian team, Joe Olina [Sebastian] and [TOM] Kronshild,” Louboutin wrote in a tweet. “Your healthy spirit made for an awesome moment. Thanks for allowing me to have such an amazing run.”\nThe Austrian faces a tough task in this week’s big meet, hosting a short track event at San Jose in California at the weekend.\nSloss, whose pursuit of a maiden Olympic gold medal in the women’s skeleton won gold in the 2014 Vancouver Games, had a nasty fall during Sunday’s medal push, plunging to her knees and gasping for breath before being stung by Louboutin’s heels before returning to the track.\n“This, my second start at the Olympics, was a spectacular one,” said Sloss, who also raced his father Ryan Sloss to the 1924 Salt Lake City Olympics. “The success I’ve been enjoying this week and all the hard work I’ve put in throughout the season has helped me continue my development.”\nMeanwhile, Louboutin told Darmstadt Zeitung that he is still frustrated at missing a chance to compete at this year’s Olympics.\n“It was really amazing,” he said. “I was surprised that I was at these Olympics because you see so many upsets.”\nLouboutin will take an advanced package from his father in his attempt to compete at Pyeongchang, where his dad won the last four events.\nThe Austrian, who finished fourth at this year’s Baku Winter Games, is best known for his electronic style in tight pants and sporty caps, and has won gold medals at two of the events he competed at at the Sochi Olympics.\nLouboutin’s strong standing in the world of electronic music certainly wouldn’t hurt Louboutin, who just last week entered a record book with twenty new songs.\nLouboutin’s songs have been included on Billboard’s Hot 100 countdown. He also recently landed on the concert soundtrack for the Disney Channel TV series “Flowers in the Attic,” about a singer-songwriter who gets hitched to his dreams.\nHe tweeted about celebrating his feat on Thursday.\n“Just finished recording my first #Electronic music album,” he tweeted. “However after a week of delay, it is finally coming out this week. Thank you to everyone for their support and staying the course!”\n']"
539,Netflix is worth more than Disney,"['Every year, data from entertainment websites like Research In Motion’s Research In Motion Ltd. and Starz shows a correlation between the number of monthly Netflix subscribers and the number of Hulu subscriptions. Is Netflix like this? Yep.\nThe activity is quite random, though, and, really, what they show is over and over again. Netflix’s $40.1 billion in revenue at the end of last year was on par with Disney’s $47.3 billion in revenue. Unlike most on-demand entertainment providers, Netflix doesn’t stop streaming content all the time. Netflix also tracks subscriber engagement and demand; with Netflix’s first year’s number of U.S. subscribers I’d consider an early indicator of engagement.\nNetflix is already grappling with declining monthly user base, with subscriber costs increasing while streaming revenue is falling: about 25% growth from 2012 to 2017, to $1.2 billion. Two of Netflix’s key sponsors, iTunes and Disney, recently announced a joint venture with Apple. iTunes is a digital music store offering content from artists like Miley Cyrus, Ray Charles, and many other artists. iTunes said that streaming video on Netflix and iTunes is over 95% penetrated.\nAll of this illustrates the one thing Netflix could do differently. No matter how open we are to sharing our internet, simple information or snooping on our friends, the way we use our voice and screen is going to disappear. The tech companies that want to fight at-large control and censor content, do so in ways that benefit consumers. Microsoft, Google, Amazon and the like are currently unable to do so, as a result of their stake in satellite TV distributor DirecTV. They can’t fully build any “computers” when those control groups aren’t removed by the DMCA. The far more worrisome tactic they’re using might be to get their overly profitable cash cow out of the way. Dish wants to kill that business model and grab 10% of the space in the whole pay-TV business.\nNetflix is so effective at doling out such free TV content that some analysts believe the company could be on its way to being the dominant video content provider around the world, if not a satellite TV provider. There’s a price to that: Significantly less than Apple and Google could require such a truce. Fortunately, the studios in attendance at this week’s CINEMA conference are accustomed to this concession: Netflix has also signaled that its content will also be marked down if it gains significant market share.\nNetflix is more than just a streaming service that consists of massive data streams. It also manages the astonishing size of its subscriber base. Since 2014, Netflix has grown almost 13% from 58.6 million to 73.7 million. And, if this trend continues, as expected, the company’s subscriber base should exceed 400 million by 2018. It’s where we’re going to see serious inflation over the next five years.\nNetflix’s move to crack the $30-per-month for streaming is a stroke of genius. Consider that at the end of last year, 40% of its current subscribers streamed more than one service, so the company is shooting for 200 million monthly Netflix subscribers in 2020. To put that number out there, you can’t say the same for just Netflix. It’s not a singles or doubles market.\n']"
540,Transcripts,"['Off-camera today he seems like a decent guy, he has a nice manner. He’s a strong guy, he’s had one hell of a few rough years. He seems like he’s always been fairly intelligent, a little bit invested in the community. He brings an intensity and passion to leadership in four separate ways.\nHe’s got this curious impulsiveness that gives me the idea of manipulation. It is easy for a co-worker to get caught up in “amateur micromanagement” as our CEO was, and he doesn’t seem to be wasting any time, organizing himself for the new or busy life.\nHe’s also tremendous in the operating team at his company, and with that comes the unfortunate realization that his company and I were fired the minute I ended my stay at Kayak for eight months. His business is now untrammeled due to the industry’s feeble tenures, and he apparently thinks that this is the path he can steer in the future. Once we get our hardware fixed he really gets on board, and he’s a huge portion of his later life, if we can’t run around and carve our own little stall stall. Right away I’m certain that my next-door neighbor would be keen to have a conversation with him when he gets the chance.\nHe brings an energy, a thoughtfulness that can rival Mick Jagger when we first met, and that moves us all in the direction of different dreams. He’s a confident leader that when pressed creatively, speaks with the confidence of a man who’s most loyal to himself (something you can only do if you’re part of a powerful company like Kayak) which is rare among businessmen. With such a straight look, it’s hard not to see a guy who’s pure entertainment in an otherwise tough world.\nHe’s great, he knows he’s doing his best work, and he’s definitely not taking this new-found success for granted. He’s proven us that no matter what our priorities and even where we are, we can carry all that and do everything we’re told, it takes a long time to fully embrace “Act Right.”\nThe fact that he was himself in Kayak for eight months could be directly related to his desire to leave. He was most recently in office when the company made an announcement that the InterContinental Hotel in Washington, D.C. was going to close down. His resignation letter was filled with reason, and it certainly delivered on that. With a new manager and a new strategy, it certainly made Kayak a better place to work, and should resonate with our existing employees, which has been quite a challenge.\nWith his instincts and that flexibility, it’s definitely making him more productive, and stronger than any of the returning competitors. His decision to go on an expiring deal with Kayak does show us just how effective the company is now, but for the first time this new iteration of management is moving on to a new reality.\nI’m glad we didn’t have to wait for Kayak to announce the end of the partnership. I’m pretty sure that Chris White wouldn’t have otherwise worked with him, and he’d have given me a much-needed chance to see his rough-and-tumble skills.\nOnce you’ve been in Kayak, I suspect that you’ll be much more likely to come around and become a participant in successful businesses. From being looked at as our friend to integrating investment to improving people’s long-term performance, the next phase of Kayak is going to be one of co-founder time. For Tim, it will be changing his horizon and his showmanship, and it will likely be a time when Kayak gets its investment.\n']"

Check out excerpts below.\nGiorgio Moroder\nOn what happened in February of last year:\n“This president, reelected in 2013, he claims that we got a ‘noticeable extension of a Chinese investment law.’ But most of the previous administration as well as the previous U.S. administration had made very prescient predictions about what may come up in this week’s event. They talked about the fact that we had effectively violated Title IX and were paying the rapacious students that were dismissed, estimated that the students we had dismissed were not only students, but also educational minorities with no future, but we have filed not only a Complaint, but also a request to file a report on the record. And so one of the issues that we are facing is that without that date, not only were these comments blatantly made in blatant violation of Title IX and the law, were never made public. You just heard from my political superiors.”\nOn the legacy that has been proposed in B.C. to build a North American International Auto Show:\n“Yes, with North American International Auto Show coming up later this year on Tuesday, I’m hopeful that we can talk about how on the history side what the history of the B.C. history is. It is proof that we still have a great corporation that’s going to be in Canada, we have great international corporations and that is a good thing. We need to do a great number of things. One of the things that we need to do is unify what people have said around this fair is that many of our nations have had great dealings with China for centuries. We have reached many agreements in Canada. We’ve had agreements in the United States. Those relationships with China have never been better than they are now.”\nOn the current administration’s policies to have an office staffed by Chinese people:\n“We have a lot of Chinese, including that is on the ticket. We’re going to have a planning office with very limited people, and many of our campaigns, through phones, through emails, through call centers, have been targeted by various opposition forces that try to target Chinese people and their representatives. That’s a very dangerous trend. We would hate to see that. It’s not working either, but we think we can find a solution. They basically killed that vote by election, and they killed that vote by election.”\nOn what questions for his group to ask in the coming weeks:\n“The issue is has recently been raised when Mr. Trump is coming in. My first question is, if you’re out there projecting that millions and millions of Americans can’t come to Washington, D.C., for free, to actually buy into this vision and vision that we have of a world that has opened up, shouldn’t the reality that a lot of our nations, many of our economies, are now worth as much as we are today, as human beings, an economic system that has allowed people to get what they want, particularly in this country? I think that we’re not going to just be exempt. We can help people say they want better times for the people in this country so that they can come and purchase a better life for themselves and others.”\nOn another issue where the question regarding the perpetrators has been raised:\n“Let me say, so many people have gotten asked questions.

But I think that these reflections and observations are very real: not only for myself and of my generation, but for those who have been incarcerated and involved with prison.\nAnd, of course, for the coments of liberty, too, our shared companions and survivors of incarceration.\nSo, this diaries are important.

They have posted their stories and stories as a new form of public memory, a new beginning. They have opened the door of people whose life had been altered and who had contributed to the understanding of their lives, their relationship with others and with their community.\nThey can make a much fuller, important contribution to life than those entrusted with compromising their shared personal and social values or to clandestinely electing or censoring certain members of their community. They can influence and influence and influence millions of Americans.\nMost importantly, they are dealing with the enduring themes of spiritual awakening and existential crises, in our own hearts and minds. They are the reflections of our profound sense of the divine and our need to enter and self-immolate at another's leisure, to exercise refuge and reflection in the present moment, to have anew-water the soul of life, to transform and unlearn the darkness of our past as a new, new beginning. They are the reflections of our hope, its possibility, its way of living - that we may learn to be bolder in our own lives, to rediscover ourselves, our own sense of the infinite, of the infinity and infinity of our world.\nThis anthology is important because it demonstrates that our pilgrimage to free from the temptations of the prison can be reversed, and instead we may be able to recharge into more solid and life-giving long-term communal and relational life experiences as witnesses to the ways and actions of others.\nWe may explore, guided by the Bible, the veracity of our convictions, the mysterious and the infinite, our courageous road to spiritual awakening, a timeless vision of living as life.\nBut we can also try to open our search for the depth and pride that might help us get to know ourselves - and bring forth our deepest selves to be seekers of the humanity.\nI am speaking here of a man who as a man of conscience repudiated the corrupt and selfish ways of others and chose in part to live alone and be no less than his best friend and lover. But I hope you can get out of that prison life and go back to your place of refuge with your natural capacity for charity, good will, courage, generosity, cooperation, of thinking and word of mouth.\nIn such times, we stand to learn what we know - what we have learned - and become role models for others. We are born to journey again and, especially, grow wiser and better. We are ahead of the competition of the pack. And that's what Jesus has taught us.\nThere are 8,000 words here in the diaries.

544,Transcripts,"[""Twelve years after 9/11, the real hero of our country died on 30th February 2010: John F. Kennedy.\nKennedy was the country's greatest and most beloved soldier, leader and hero whose courage and compassion for other’s in war gave all our servicemen and women precious and invaluable service.\nWhen I went to work this morning for the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DoPA) as a translator, I met JFK’s son-in-law, Arizona Coriello, along with the rest of Arizona’s congressional delegation. My feelings on the death of the nation’s finest military veteran, also known as John F. Kennedy, began to grow more clear by the day as he, never shy about showing the way into our nation’s heart, seemed to effortlessly switch into a quiet dignity and life’s simplicity as the subject of war dramatized by his father’s contribution to our national security.\nFrom the inside, we knew that John F. Kennedy’s life, and what America represents, would forever be defined and even later hardened by the understanding that there were no profits made in the execution of his life in public. He lived by a code of honor, a code he still maintained and a code the documents he made available to his fellow soldiers, including his video diary of their combat hours in Iraq. His diary would reverberate over and through us, affecting our reactions and focusing us on the continuous stream of broken promises and betrayals which lingered for us in our daily routines, as well as the tragic loss of countless American lives in the war to name just one example.\nMany of us now have found solace by following his lead on a far greater scale. We took his fight on back to the lower levels of our government, giving him a second chance, serving him with distinction for decades, making the decision to extend his life in active service during a time of promise and promise fulfilment, and ending his time in prison, away from their blood and hearts, in London. Many of us followed his lead along the way as our lives were written up in the same anthology while another, unconnected portion of his life was simply celebrated in front of the world as the complete and enduring valor of the martyred.\nFor the past year I have been busy traveling the country for what has become an annual memorial memorial service for John F. Kennedy, with additional traveling trips (in connection with the Global War on Terror) to other countries to honor him. As he sat in his plane in Philadelphia on 31st February 2010 I started to see how much America really appreciated and appreciated his act of service and his courage. This year I thought I would revisit what was happening in the earlier years of John F. Kennedy’s life.\nThere’s no being let go from that work which would belong to the poeple. Only being born on 7th July 1783 to an American father, John F. Kennedy headed the Army of the Republic in the Caribbean before dying at the age of 31 in Las Vegas on 30th February 2010. After serving two years in that plane home in the United States, John F. Kennedy died in a Texas hospital while in an Oklahoma prison on 31st January 2010 at 38. I wonder what was said to tell my brothers and sisters in law and others that just starting to chart the trajectory of the distance from the tragedy to the future: “Oh, my gosh! I love my freedom! Let’s fly, have a life, take it to a new place.” It was perhaps the language of the rebels who wanted to the rebels feel of their way through the globe’s turbulence, and John F. Kennedy was a man of courage and faith in himself. No stoning or imprisonment he would have ever lasted.”\nJohn F. Kennedy will be sorely missed by many of his colleagues, sons, daughters, grandmothers, siblings, colleagues, parents, friends, and countless members of the military and the family. His image will never be duplicated and forgotten, but his importance still has not diminished.\n""]"

But a late-break outbreak had seen more than 7,200 cases across 13 countries in the past week and more than 400 fatalities.\nKartibooni, a small monkey that had been shown to pick up food that had been contaminated, has been identified as the most severe and potentially responsible of the outbreak.\nThe white monkey, called Sulu, has been isolated at the sex workers’ house in Maungdaw, 100 km north of Bangkok, and is now “walking in a closed area,” Asia’s top health official said.\nKharkod Chieh, WHO director-general, said infections “can last days or weeks and can lead to serious, debilitating damage to humans”.\n']"

The so-called “Foreign Gene – the goyim” run by emerging market expertise is consistently one of the largest and most reliable genetic watchdogs in the world, a not-always-often-overlooked or overlooked group of international experts who work their hearts out and speak with a high level of competence, making efforts from the moment the tip of the spear is connected to the killer virus.\nRecently, we tracked down two crucial emerging market specialists behind the development of locally relevant Diagnostics-Risk Checking, the efforts of Emergency Based Diagnostics (EBM) in an effort to improve diagnoses and likelihood of detection. Although not far from the zero we’d even looked for, the second emerging market specialist, Miss Glafening, is in the business of doing it right.\nThe industry is looking for a fix, and Miss Glafening is doing something that fits its niche: go on line to continue the implementation of EBM by adoption.\nWhile EBM is helping the diagnostic world with the latest lead screening—tests that detect unexpected diseases like diabetes and prostate cancer—Miss Glafening is helping a fast growing field of cold-sensing, molecular diagnostic testing in the fast-moving, booming consumer healthcare market. It is one which promises to be a game changer for the increasingly mobile health population.\nFor a decade since its founding, EBM has based its background on detecting and predicting cold-sensing diseases that are still common worldwide. In that time, it has connected infectious diseases like measles, diphtheria, Ebola, MERS, influenza and many other diseases. By sourcing expert firms and their on-the-ground expertise, it develops a set of test kits which help fill gaps in its database and educate others about cold-sensing techniques.\nEBM’s efficacy as a detection method for cold-sensing diseases has come directly from the recruitment of a committed team of global experts who are passionate about bringing together the finest specialists on-the-ground and coming up with what we believe will be a hit.\n']"

553,Former CDC director: It's time to restrict visits to nursing homes,"['(CNN) — More than 160 doctors and other health professionals belong to the American Academy of Pediatrics. The group was founded in 1905 as a movement to discourage exposure to dangerous chemicals and public health risks.\nThough the organization never formally recognized itself as an advocacy group, as it has gotten more global, it’s its power at the local level now feels more generalized.\n“Not only does it say its goal is to create and promote great patient care, but it does it to help elect members of Congress to build better medical communities within the country — one that is better equipped to hear medical concerns, how to disseminate information, and how to run multiple clinical and related networks,” said David Faxon, co-chair of AAP’s board of directors.\nThe most recent executive order from the Trump administration drew immediate objections from the most prominent medical groups.\nOn Thursday, the American Medical Association called the directive — this time to require screening and phasing in the now-standard daily required intake to consult with a doctor and pay a fee to attend a medical conference — “deeply troubling.”\nBeth Kochner, president of the Institute for Family Medicine, warned that “restricting these important government organs to private health providers is morally bankrupt.”\nJames Gottlieb, a professor at Texas A&M and director of University of Missouri’s APM-Poster School of Medicine, told the panel: “I have heard this a number of times in recent meetings. This is really a time to allow emergency rooms to determine whether they can pay their bill.”\nThe new directive requires doctors and other health professionals to leave the country with at least four minutes to sit down and talk to a patient in their own room. And that takes care of most of the questions that patients have to ask — such as, “How is this handled?” and “If your child is old enough to sit in the room, could you provide some data for you?”\nHealth professionals sometimes said they feared this step would allow them to do both things: reducing their potentially harmful exposure to chemicals and upending the strict health-safety regulations that health officials still have to adhere to.\nRelated:\nPrevious Obama-era order in wake of CDC exposure blurs history\nCDC orders to control problematic chemical labels\n']"

If your loved one is over 60, read this","['Say what you want about the public, but it is really hard to escape feeling the occasional ticklish sensation in your lungs.\nA new study found that kids with a string of loose abscesses, a high fever and “frozen respiratory infections” were two to nine times more likely to die in nearly one year than kids who were not sick in the first place. And in overall, mortality rates dropped by 50%.\nThe research comes as a news report last month hinted that coronavirus is turning to children to seek medical attention after tests confirmed 11 cases of the infection around the country last year.\nHowever, it’s not clear how the disease developed, either. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that two cases of coronavirus were confirmed last year and one a month.\nAn annual review that followed, confirming the importance of education, understanding the virus and warning of its symptoms showed an overall benefit at the low end, with mortality rates hitting 18% nationally.\nThere are “evidence-based” ways to catch these infections, but not all are easy — especially when you’re one of the children living with them — and parents are already trying — something where some don’t feel like about it at all.\nSome parents are using catch-all devices called DOR or thallium from friends to save their children’s lives. But they can be unsafe, so do your best to be extra cautious.\nFor the parents of kids with the disease who are given antacids, a first-aid kit is likely to save them.\n“First and foremost, go absolutely immediate,” says Paul Rubine, president of advocacy group California at the American Heart Association.\nTo bathe them and test their eyes against a moist airway is “a very simple solution,” he says. And after washing them thoroughly, they should be checked for infections.\n“You do need to, as a parent, see if you have any of these (codavirus-linked) symptoms,” he says. “That’s where the problem lies in getting immunized. There are many questions you have to ask yourself as you try to know what’s in your kid’s system.”\nYes, it’s a rare disease that could just be a rash and a virus that spreads via infected fluid. But only a few cases have been reported. It was caused by a viral strain of SARS, a highly contagious virus that swelled to four strains after it emerged on the World Health Organization’s list of the 50 most dangerous viruses worldwide.\nThat can cause any of the symptoms, like dizziness and disorientation.\nWhat’s happening in your family is your responsibility, as you handle this situation. If there’s nothing else you can do,\n“It’s not that we should just say, ‘Oh, we didn’t see anything,’” Rubine says. “We’re responsible for helping patients understand their own body needs.”\nYou and your pediatrician don’t have to be that comfortable with everyone talking about the illness at the same time.\n“Just feel good — out of the blue,” says Infertility Specialist Lisa Morris, who specializes in babies at UMH Medical Center in Fargo, North Dakota.\n“You really believe that your heart’s beating, and your bodies are responding well to that,” she says. “But it can be very hard when you’re dealing with kids and sick lungs, you’re juggling a lot of things. It’s a very challenging time to manage the immune system.”\nInstead, get\nyour health coach. She’s in charge of a team that works with a series of 100-plus kids at the Fargo school where the children are enrolled in I & E health assessments, trying to respond as rapidly as possible to the infection.\n“We would be working with family members of sick adults,” Morris says. “We’re worried about them breathing heavily, not washing, without oxygen. We say, ‘Should we tell your doctor?’ because the expertise is so strong.”\nBut after a few months of talking to parents and seeing how important it is to parent it like they should — Morris knows how difficult a decision it can be to help sick children, especially a young age.\nAnd she’s helping them by using fecal immunoassay to confirm exactly how many people']"

But now it’s unraveling like a snowflake in a sugar dump. A new coronavirus has spread from its breeding center in Argentina to a nearby south-western Peru, bringing diarrhea to hundreds of thousands of students and teacher-proficient students in the region.\nThe vaccine, H3N2, has already been used in a recent outbreak of León virus in Guanajuato state. It has no vaccine for infectious diarrhea, nor has it been approved by the federal government for use on children.\nSo it’s no wonder schools are struggling to prepare for what will surely be a catastrophic pandemic. What did the schoolchildren learn?\n“We have taken the children out of the classroom,” said the school psychologist. “That’s really sad. This one’s a learning experience, but there’s a life lesson that needs to be learnt.”\nRecent shows\nWorldwide, the number of children hospitalized for major virus infections in the first 24 hours of the illness has more than doubled since 2009, said Phil Boroch, a former microbiologist at NASA, who served on the undersecretary for health. “These kids tend to hit it hard, which is why we are talking about the three stages in Viruses 1 and 2: full-blown diarrhea, partially (filament) and partially refirals,” he said. “But their major symptoms are aberrations and seizures, which is the hallmark of these viruses.”\nAnd the strains that control the virus have receded, he said.\n“Within the first 24 hours, kids have an infection (which according to the latest projections can last five months). They do vomit, they cough, and they don’t respond to anything else,” Boroch said.\nThat’s especially true because the viruses cause diarrhea, not reining in their massive appetite for food. “Doping was part of their diet, but they don’t fight. They just take a few pills,” he said. “It’s probably not infectious since the brain tells it there are measles and rubella (infections). That’s why kids have to learn about these plagues.”\nBut there are other things that are cause for concern, such as the vaccination process, Boroch said. The US government and HHS are set to release final reports on the steps taken by the Department of Health and Human Services in response to the latest virus outbreak on Friday.\nSo how will children handle the inevitable death of their classmates? “We want to reassure you that we are making a difference in your lives and your future,” Boroch said. “That means that they, in turn, need to make sure that they are being trained to carry out the rigorous research, which is something that we will do.”\nThere will be a fight\nThe U.S. government is already making investments in help to support county-based volunteers. Officials say that this outbreak has been wiped out, with 154 or 88 percent of children infected with the current outbreak back in school.\n']"

This virus may not be affecting all health care workers. Some people may still be able to become infected and fight against this virus.\nAnd there is a way to prevent your child from becoming infected, especially if you are eligible to give birth to an actual baby, unless you have already delivered.\nWhen a child is born, having them vaccinated will prevent future exposure to the virus.\nYour child’s immune system doesn’t protect against the virus. There are two components that are known to make the virus immune to infants.\nFirst, the antibodies will show up in the lining of the body to reject the viruses.\nSecond, the immune system will react to the virus. That means, you can get the virus from things outside of your body.\nThis means, kids today can detect and kill the virus.

There’s no conclusive evidence that it’s the customarily-documented organism.\nIf a person was given chickenpox, the latter news is rather doubtful at best.\nIn addition, the main problem with genital herpes is that most people have symptoms associated with it, though not all people have genital herpes. According to the Mayo Clinic, genital herpes can cause severe or permanent damage, like flesh convulsions, lacerations and muscle stiffness, similar to a breast fracture.\nFurthermore, genital herpes is especially difficult to treat and prevent. Similar to skin lesions or people with genital herpes, genital herpes can be spread even by walkers or people who are exposed to females.\nWhat to look for in a genital killer\nMany people think genital herpes is a harmless annoyance and therefore not a disease. While yes it can be horrible, it does exist in general, but it is very common. This is why it is not commonly found among pregnant women, however it is often recognized by birth attendants as a potential marker of oral herpes. It’s not just anyone who needs to visit a doctor to find out what caused genital herpes.\nMany people cannot understand why this condition is not a regular thing, because it is not a routine and common occurrence. According to viral infections, newer viruses, like the listeria and salmonella, cause more viruses to appear. Thus, it is common for people to become curious and want to see how their bodies are responding.\nIt’s also important to remember that no matter how many times you feel a strong feeling in your mouth, it won’t be enough to produce a fever. Also, if you get the infection in the first place, be sure to consult a doctor before going to the hospital. Also, check your doctor for signs of herpes before getting sick.\nThere is no way to know how widespread genital herpes is because many people have to wait until they are infected to find out. However, if you fall ill as a result of a genital herpes infection, have blood tests done that will show the molecular makeup of the virus, but be sure to wait until your symptoms like infection appear or you are infected before seeing a doctor.\nDon’t assume you should get the vaccine\nMost people are not aware that herpes is the only part of the genital herpes community that a person can go to for genital herpes. There are strains of the bacteria that infect cells. However, some other things aren’t the problem. Infants or toddlers have to develop an infection before they can get pregnant, since it’s common. And even if you get genital herpes, it’s unlikely you would start having an intimate relationship with the X.\nHuman herpes virus strains are known to play a role in human infertility, but what are the symptoms and ways of dealing with them? For people who have received X because of herpes, the usual things are to let your doctor know. Listers and infected saliva and urine can be provided to you to help you deal with all the symptoms. Women should see a doctor if they have genital herpes.\n']"

And there are few guidelines for dieting.\n“Contrary to many estimates, consumers not only have the wrong food choices, but also are over-exercising and inactivity,” the authors write.\n“Interestingly, both dietary fiber and antioxidants can increase the use of supplements and pose risks.”\nBut the findings suggest that diets that combine dietary fiber and supplements can promote weight control and this can also aid heart rate and blood pressure, the authors note.\n']"
562,Your waist size may be more important than weight for multiple heart attack risk,"['Early pregnancy leads to a higher risk of early heart disease, according to a new study in the British Medical Journal.\nResearchers examined 14,000 women after giving birth, and three-quarters reported a risk of heart disease.\nThe 27-year-old women were randomly assigned to keep their waist size in check, and had a 0.6 percent chance of getting heart disease before giving birth. Women who had a poor testroplege (negative exercise habits) or a poor testroplege (negative weight) were assigned to see how much weight they shed during pregnancy. The second dozen women gave as much as 80 pounds.\nThe researchers found that the late delivery of a child increases the risk of a heart attack by one percent and by more than one percent, as compared to women who ate more calories in a pregnancy as early as 32 weeks, after the first trimester.\nSo what was behind the lowered risk? If women whose weight was very high compared to women who were obese were underweight, the decreased risk of early heart disease would continue to increase.\nWe\'re not talking about people\'s weight, we\'re talking about women\'s fitness.\n""People are not very skinny and they\'re too fat, so if you become overweight you\'re going to have cardiovascular problems, lower blood flow to the heart and that can lead to a really bad result,"" said Dr. Ewen Bennett, who worked on the study.\n""So in this case you were in a little bit of a \'Big Fat No-Breaker\' diet. Here we used a large population of women on a fat diet to go out to exercise and eat more often,"" Bennett told CNN.\n""Our findings are pretty convincing. In fact, there are plausible reasons not to be overweight. It\'s simple -- but you have a genetic predisposition or biological predisposition to develop cardiovascular disease,"" Bennett added.\n""One of the places I think we know is that your body is both a fat-burning machine, and it\'s complex, and it\'s very hard to appreciate as a person,"" he added.\nThe study suggests that the prenatal obesity raised other risk factors for the heart.\nFirst, participating in the risk-reduction diet did mean that in addition to being overweight, obese women also had major body mass index readings of .75, or about 24 pounds, and six people had an overweight body mass index of .10.\nBennett said those who ate more calories during pregnancy increased the risks of an early heart attack.\nSo while obesity may make us leaner and meaner, women of certain racial and ethnic backgrounds also have greater likelihood of an early heart attack.\nFrequency of pregnancy\nFirst, birth can make you more likely to receive an early heart attack, said Bennett. The study used data from a recent Multidisciplinary Heart Review Trial, but includes longer-term reports of cardiovascular events.\n""The lack of certainty that one may have the potential for heart attack and therefore a quick heart attack is very problematic. Too often we see those who want to be thin and people who want to be confident saying, \'I\'m not having these fits,\'"" Bennett added.\nDuring pregnancy, women with unhealthy weight were 25 percent more likely to get a heart attack.\n""This study strongly suggests that overweight women tend to have cardiovascular problems at even greater risk of cardiovascular problems,"" Bennett said.\n']"
563,"Avoid these five risk factors and live longer, study says","['By Katie Klein\nAssociated Press\nNEW YORK — Studies and the World Health Organization also suggest the risk of heart disease increases with longer life expectancy.\nResearchers at Harvard University in Boston and the Mayo Clinic say the findings are important to better educate Americans about how many different factors influence our risk of death.\nWhen the researchers asked people about their risk factors, they found a 64 percent higher proportion of people who carry a high risk of heart disease.\nBut even among people who carry the highest risk of heart disease, many of them still had the lowest amount of lifestyle diseases.\nThe risk of cancer was 36 percent higher with a higher chance of death from any cause than with nothing but a low risk of death.\nThere were 24,343 heart disease cases in England in 2014, but just 3,251 of them were from people who had a high risk of death.\nEach person carries a total of 111 heart attacks or strokes annually.\nIf you have a high risk of heart disease, cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, or obesity, don’t smoke or drink alcohol. It’s important to exercise regularly. Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and smoking cigarettes.\nStay active, not breathe pollution and pollution, smokefree. It’s “excellent advice” for those in doubt about whether they can get “real” health benefits from exercising, says Harvard researcher John Garnett, a physical activity doctor at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York.\nIf you notice a lump or bleeding on your body, tell a doctor, a doctor’s office worker or a doctor’s office mate to stop after the lump.\nIf you must have an operation or amputation for a heart problem, get in physical therapy and medical education sessions. If you look for health benefits from a loved one, make sure they listen to others.\nSupport your physician or doctor to help you reach those goals.\nSeniors need to get an annual health plan starting in Medicare, the federal health program for the elderly. If you get health insurance through work, you can get an increase.\nIf you have heart disease, follow up with a doctor.\nInfants are different. Even elderly children are at increased risk of developing heart disease. In older children, geriatric genetics can play a role in how their body responds to the effects of sudden death.\nAble-bodied kids fare better, but if you are on prescription drugs, don’t seek treatment unless it’s safe to do so.\nIf you have a high risk of menopause, you should have your doctor consult a health expert.\nYou can also contact a doctor who specializes in your treatment.\nThese factors are tracked individually and are not part of the disease risk analysis or registry of deaths, but like heart disease, are much more common.\nThe remaining factors include diabetes, smoking, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, pain and how much nicotine you use.\nFor more details, visit the Harvard Health Foundation website.\n']"

565,"Exercise advice on food labels could help reduce obesity, researchers say","['NEW YORK (CNN) — Fitness, detox and meditation can help ward off risk factors for obesity, but how much exercise really helps with weight control, aren’t seen as helpful in reducing the health risk, a new study suggests.\nTreatments, exercising and meditation may be helpful to reducing weight, especially for people living with diabetes and non-diabetic conditions, and for people who are feeling extremely weight-conscious, researchers led by researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found.\nBut the results couldn’t separate the two approaches directly. The investigators examined the role of exercise, inflammation and inflammation-related conditions in obesity, and found changes in specific measures of inflammation. Specifically, the team showed that a heavier person who exercised had a smaller and weaker than average daily body mass index, meaning they consume fewer calories.\nIn contrast, overweight and obese individuals whose exercise was targeted only to specific diseases were actually at more active risk for obesity.\n“These findings bolster the ongoing evidence linking exercise and inflammation, and highlight the need for further research to study the impact of exercise on obesity,” study researcher Dr. Jozef Faderam of the T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Cambridge University in Massachusetts said in a statement.\nResearchers studied data from two epidemiologic databases: a data set representing the amount of exercise time a person exercised, and an Excel spreadsheet with a daily rate of daily calories burned.\nTo come up with the effect of exercise on obesity, the researchers scanned the data for serum oxygen content, pH, pH4, and ozone. They also analyzed the data for elevated skin pH, a measure of chronic acidity in the skin and the pH of the tank.\nThey also looked at the levels of both two types of inflammation, in comparison with the 0.75- and 0.65-degree ranges in calorie, insulin, and abdominal fat values, respectively. They took tissue samples and compared the cortisol levels and insulin levels for both groups in the sample.\nThey found the levels of inflammation and inflammation-related conditions in the cohorts were significantly higher in obese people with obesity and those with non-diabetic conditions than in those with controls.\nThe study was published in the journal Healthy People.\n']"
566,"What this sunny, religious town in California teaches us about living longer","['A few two years ago, I had a cup of coffee with my liberal coworker to talk about life ahead and what some of our community’s younger generations (one of them the kids of my parents) might be thinking about. What she and I had shared, in no small measure, was that our grandparents, who lived to be 50 and were predisposed to Alzheimer’s disease, had been walking long distances all along their retirement years before we were going to die. This was a wise decision.\nAfter more than 20 years of hoping for a normal life expectancy, we entered my niece’s home in Northern California. I was looking forward to lunch and weekends away from home, but while I was tired at work when I was sick, I found the plans for a quiet home and the mind-bendingly expansive views of the Pacific Ocean to be incredibly challenging to design and execute.\nUpon my arrival, I found a guy who was in his late 30s living around 50 to 60 years old with a predisposed to Alzheimer’s disease.\nWell, his five years and the time he was spent in his 90s didn’t end with him being a good husband. He came back home and missed his family, the first time I had had a conversation with him and I wanted to speak more freely about his situation.\nWe talked about whether or not he had an environment in which he knew his fate. For many of us, planning is a process of moving away from poverty or isolation, and often in much worse moments than we usually do. The choice to move out is critical in deciding if to live long enough to endure the agony of failure and hopefully slow down the process of becoming a normal person. And when we have families in place that are ready and willing to hold us, even as years or generations pass and there’s time for us to be comfortable knowing that we can stop the process and live life with minimal regret.\nFor many older adults, starting at age 50 is the place where we finally begin to pay into the nest. As seniors are nearing retirement and becoming, maybe, new, qualified providers, we’re starting to listen. We can’t be complacent, we can’t seem to believe we have enough time to be certain that we’re doing well.\nWith the passage of one vote in the last decade, we can now boldly head out for better, healthier life choices rather than pursue every option we’re afraid of.\nBefore I reached 62, I did a couple of things right; one was getting in touch with a pediatrician. She is widely regarded as the best prognosticator in the field of pediatric care and offers diverse advice and resources. The other was getting involved with a community project involving the children of parents with oncology-delinquent families.\nEvery month we prepare an end-of-life paper for our grandchildren and their caregivers. Each December, we write a thank-you letter. The paper was inked into our palms, leaving us with a touch of hope, hopes and love. “In each year since then, I have had the opportunity to say, ‘Thank you,’” writes Ruth Whittaker, our kids’ director of child development. “I am grateful for all the additional blessings I have had in the short years since I have been old.”\nI know that as life moves forward, we’ll have to change our negative behaviors; how we respond to strangers and see them as often associated with our ailments, talents, or abilities. There are many reasons why we’re not living to our full potential, so imagine being part of these systems of well-being that we’re not able to enjoy the privilege of just hanging out with friends.\nI know. You don’t. You don’t bring life, sunshine and ease to life when you look at it, saying how grateful you are that something like this came your way. You’re a person with a deep connection to God, a reason to not care anymore, a reason to find the inner peace, the reason for feeling good to begin with.\nIf anyone thinks our culture hasn’t changed since our pioneers and elders were old, try ordering yourself a birth certificate. Just don’t think this is a “pro-life,” “sisterhood,” or a lifestyle choice. These things, more than anything else, can all be changed — with or without a few conveniences and certain basic behaviors.\nAs we age, we must change our attitudes, our behaviours, our behaviors.']"

When they completed the survey, 42 percent of the respondents said they do not run in their local area. Nearly one-third said they do.\nWhat they found was that male and female children were 8.8 times more likely to run than their girls. If men ran in their country, they were almost six times more likely to run away.\nAccording to the study, though, the study appears to be a ""rigorous statistical analysis"" rather than a concerted attempt to infer otherwise.\nBased on the choice of parents, and their background as individuals, the study goes out of its way to suggest that gender differences are not about to be repeated - and maybe that\'s the question researchers can answer with the help of science.\n']"
568,"A later bedtime linked with obesity for children under 6, study says","['NEW YORK (CNN) — Researchers say to calm your brain with some morning workouts and daytime stays associated with an early decline in weight, they propose that eating breakfast before bed becomes a stress reliever.\nThe findings may help explain why younger kids actually get more active, according to a future paper that appeared in the Journal of Pediatrics.\nThe study found that rats fed very little breakfast took longer to lose weight.\nAnother goal of research on helping people with weight problems reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease has been to increase the chances they have the genes that drive an obesity epidemic, The study reported. It found that those with a significant amount of common metabolic diseases likely have the genes that cause obesity.\nThe study involved 413 children in Portland, Oregon who had the highest rates of diabetes, smoking and physical inactivity, according to a statement on the study’s website. It suggests that those with an adequate amount of breakfast and energy resources might be less likely to use the calories in.\nBut where do kids get those kinds of information?\nThe researchers want to know. The background was raised by the answer of “You do eat breakfast, do you exercise for 10 minutes,” in the “feeling inclined to do more,” in the “feeling it improves later” in the hour before bed, and in a “concocted goal balance disorder” in children.\nThe benefits of shorter sleep have been documented in animal studies, including multiple life-threatening reactions to fast food and processed foods.\nIn most cases the benefits are evident as they occur.\n“Our conclusion is that age-appropriate sleeping patterns can have an impact on influencing the types of problems our brains are prone to,” study author Sharon Freeman-Turner, a psychologist at University of California, San Francisco, and a pediatrician and first author on the new study, told CNN.\nBut Freeman-Turner noted that the findings were published in the journal peer-reviewed literature.\nAn alarm clock\nThe original study involved a group of 210 young patients in 2005, which included children. Twelve years later, the researchers looked at the results of a different trial at nearly 200 children.\nBy year 12, total weight loss and morbidity in overweight or obese youngsters had been assessed.\nThe first year, regular, and particularly dramatic physical activity was used in one part of the study in which participants ate just 90 calories per day.\nThe researchers asked two groups of kids to do individual 3-minute, difficult-to-follow long-term, 10-minute jogs before bed. Half who were provided by the group on diets showed no increase in weights or fewer waist-lengths over the three weeks.\nAt a later point, food schedules were random and not monitored. Subjects were asked to select an eight-minute train ride that lasted only one hour or less and a 90-minute walk within 30 minutes of waking up.\nThe group had a higher BMI, low mean family income, and higher chances of developing moderate to severe dementia. The same types of lifestyle were found in adults, but this time they also had lower risk.\n“Over time, this is a very good finding that suggests that an early relationship with breakfast may contribute to developing a later BMI,” added Ryan McPherson, a researcher at Tufts University School of Medicine and the study’s lead author.\nA later bedtime\nResearchers at the University of Wisconsin Health System and St. Francis Health System in Cincinnati in Ohio asked children to slow down for 60 minutes, and then again for a half-hour, to help them be mindful of the three key areas of a child’s brain.\nResearchers recruited the children to follow the lead of the program and sat with their parents and siblings, reducing their noise levels.\nSo the first time a child was stopped and “normalized” with a technology thing was the same as when they sat down.\nPeople did a lot of “restructuring,” which involved spending fewer time thinking about themselves as babies, said study author Gina Schiparelli, who was not involved in the research.\nShe wasn’t aware of this trend, but said the kids might have gradually become more empathetic to their circumstances.\nFrequently the sensory processing “wipes away at kids’ motivation and adult coping strategies” and they become less “teachable,” she added.\n']"

570,"Social media use may harm teens' mental health by disrupting positive activities, study says","['NEW YORK (CNN) — Of the millions of texts, tweets and Facebook posts posted daily to the social media sites, social media users in teens face more social anxiety, a new study found.\nThe researchers led by Joselyn Cadavilla, a psychologist at New York’s Amherst College in Amherst, New York, looked at positive response rates for all messages about mental health. They found that these tweets and posts caused anxiety for more than a year.\nThey also observed the elevated anxiety risk for teens.\nAnd of the critical words in these tweets, anxiety about stress likely increased, the study found.\n“Any kind of emotional tension or anxiety could’ve been impairing the functioning of social networks, but rather than allowing [riskers] to reach the level that they should reach in this post-health rush, the risks were lowered,” said Cadavilla, who led the study published in December in the journal PLoS ONE.\nPrevalence of negative response\nEmotional anxiety can lead to depression, anxiety disorders, epilepsy and other mental health issues, a public health crisis with high rates among black youth. During the study period, women were more likely to have negative responses to social media messages than men.\nCadavilla said it may be that the increased connection between the connection between social media and mental health symptoms, because comments are often re-traumatized when things get out of hand, doesn’t help them.\n“Their words and actions need to be reviewed,” she said. “I don’t think they [investigative experts] have looked at it before.”\nThis leads to a “continuous cycle of punishment” to restrict social activity that puts people in the “reproductive mode” and makes them feel “depressed,” the authors of the study said.\n“What is happening in our minds is that our thoughts are being released and they rush to the [alert] and crash. This is not a mental health crisis. We need to reduce the excess,” the authors added.\n“We all have people in our lives who have a goal or strive to reach that one goal,” Cadavilla said. “And our minds are constantly wired to be primed to deal with everything that has an effect.”\nLooking for help?\nCadavilla says it’s important for teens to develop skills for managing their own feelings about health, mental health and relationships.\nShe also stressed the importance of using social media when using negative messages.\n“In our experience, people don’t need to continually monitor the social media use of teenagers … but as social media users, we want to help them as individuals and process post-career messages or prevent any social anxiety or depression,” Cadavilla said.\n“We don’t want teens to go through this entire process of their media feeding frenzy,” she added. “They need to reflect on the messages as they form.”\nInformation received on mental health is also available online, in clinical trials, at www.pone-imple.org, a private health information service provided by San Francisco-based MMSD Health.\n']"
571,Vaping: What's a parent to do?,"['The Consumer Product Safety Commission has received 4,006 tips from parents about their children\'s use of their own e-cigarettes and phthalates. The CPSC believes about 80% of cigarettes containing some form of PVC are going through the correct safe procedures, and no other products are being properly consumed and consumed.\nHere\'s what your kids need to know about cigarettes.\nConsider afternoons when they\'re lounging in the sun\nWhat is the impact on your child if you\'re just outside the gym on the day before an exam.\nYour teen might be more excited when he or she enters a school restroom as they kick the book on the floor so they may be in shape to take more exams before heading out onto the street.\nWhat are the risks of smoke and plastic products?\nAccording to the CPSC, very many potential health risks associated with tobacco products in recent years have been documented by experts. The FDA has identified more than 12,000 exposure-based products with potentially fatal or non-fatal effects in the past decade. In addition, research has shown that a person with cigarette addiction can suffer from behavioral behavioral change—opulsive behaviors that can manifest in many different psychological and emotional responses.\nWhat are known about phthalates?\nIn 2016, the FDA said polyethylene that is manufactured in an injection mold and is similar to that in cigarettes or suntan lotion are used for ""microbial composition and adaptability,"" that could potentially be toxic.\nOn a recent news report, a local TV station reported a study using VX, a phthalate that is known for producing increased cholangiocyanate and other effects, on 12,000 adults in the U.S.\nWhat should kids do before vaping?\nIf you have kids in a secluded area of the house, it is safer to vape in the privacy of their bedroom, and the ambient surroundings, and in the bathroom in case of an emergency. Just because the smell of vaping can be a little high isn\'t really what you\'re seeing. However, if it seems too much, young people can sleep with big glossy bangs and folds of thread. Read more\nIf you don\'t have electricity or faucets, you\'re not going to be vaping\nAnd what happens when you open it?\nBefore vaping in the heat of a couple of hours, the child can tell his parents if he\'s feeling nervous and anxious, and/or fatigued.\nWhen is vaping not safe?\nVaping can be harmful to your child as its effects can put you at risk for respiratory distress. Symptoms can include low loyalties, lack of concentration and fatigue, fatigue from inhaling thick amounts of gas or pollutants, exposure to low and moderate concentrations of fatty acids, if exposed to the e-liquid, and effects of e-liquid-by-wire.\nHow much do these products get through the FDA?\nVape cartridges use a certain amount of glycerin and contain potassium chloride instead of magnesium chloride. Both illegal drugs have to be squeezed out of the cartridge and turned into a biodegradable and biostatistic additive.\nVape cartridges can also be very heavy and can turn your blood into a large natural vapour. You may want to consult a physician before you buy any more since the particles cause so much damage.\nWhat\'s the proper age to vape?\nEstablish your age before you buy any vaping products. Just remember to look at the label or packaging of the products you\'re buying with your own eyes. The labels label with the product name apply to the consumer in the convenience of being able to purchase the product; you must purchase the product on its own and not reliant on third parties.\nIf your child has physical ailments that can be treated with these substances, they are at a higher risk than those of chemicals, possibly as a result of the more toxic e-liquid.\n']"
572,Leukemia: Could germ-free childhoods could trigger illness?,"['The immune system works perfectly against mice infected with Leukemia. But a new study has found an intriguing correlation between germ-free childhoods and the risk of leukaemia, Type 2 diabetes and brain cancers.\nThe research appears in the April 11 issue of the journal Cancer.\nLeukemia and Type 2 diabetes are very common in children, and children who are diagnosed with the disease every year are at increased risk of developing these diseases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nIn these cases, children with Leukemia are at higher risk of developing diabetes and more likely to receive it, scientists said.\nThe virus that causes an autoimmune reaction causes lesions in the brain and is known to also cause birth defects.\nScientists have already shown that mice afflicted with leukemia, other types of autoimmune conditions, have high immune cells, which invade parts of the body and can trigger inflammation.\nThe new research showed that mice infected with double the number of immune cells in their blood do not produce white blood cells, while the mice that received the double number of cells in their blood did not produce the white blood cells.\nThe proteins called malinophores have a role in producing antibodies that work as defenses against T cells, which is one of the more dangerous types of T cell damage.\n“Our findings suggest that animal models of the immune system take different, less radical route of attack from an animal model of the same inherited genetic disease,” said lead author Dennis Bradbury, PhD, professor of disease sciences at the University of Washington.\nIn the experiment, researchers measured the immune response in two groups. In the first group, mice with extremely high levels of immune cells had a mean genetic mutation in the B antigen, and this response meant they need more tumor cells.\n“By randomizing this defect and targeting it in mice with high levels of immune cells, we saw that mice with both very high levels of immune cells were not at the same extreme risk of developing leukemia and other types of autoimmune diseases,” said Bradbury.\nThis prompted researchers to investigate whether the most common lifestyle, including high blood pressure, alcohol consumption and smoking, would predispose individuals to a specific type of immune system, the authors said.\n“It could be either immune-mediated by high levels of cells versus limited immunity by high levels of immune cells,” said Professor Roger Bischoff, PhD, professor of infectious diseases and professor of biology at the University of Minnesota.\nBradbury, whose lab is currently developing a vaccine for leukemia, said the finding shows that research currently being done at UW is focused on finding other strategies to improve individuals’ immune systems, especially the B antigen.\n“The effect of these combination therapy studies are quite intriguing,” he said.\nFurthermore, the new study found that mice with the most low levels of immune cells in their blood do not become leukaemia.\n“An under-trend is the increases in immunity in the cells where the relative absorption level of immune cells is lower than are seen with normal immune cells,” Bradbury said.\n“Since we would want to see that this signaling pathway of the immune system flares,” he said, “the ability to maintain a sufficiently high level of immunity is important.”\n']"
573,Partial e-cigarette 'flavor ban' goes into effect today. Here's what happens next,"['By Ervin Hai\nFORT MYERS, Fla. (CNN) — A partial partial ban on e-cigarettes has been finalized in Florida — and a portion of it is set to go into effect at 5 p.m. today.\nThe full roll-out of the measure is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. Monday.\nThe location of the tax-free service is set for nine counties and one night per license, depending on the location. A state legislative committee recommended the ban in February when it had its final bill in draft form sent to President Trump.\nThe law allows limited access to a passive smoking technique called e-cigarettes, commonly known as vaping and vaporizers. After about 18 months of turning a small piece of paper into liquid nicotine in a controlled environment, vaping students must be given a list of liquids, including suzettes, before classes begin.\nIf they have e-cigarettes inside a backpack, the students must also have a bus pass to carry them. That can take anywhere from three to six days, although students who don’t have multiple passes from the bus passes can still go to the vape shop through June 30, the website says.\nThe store could pick up a few students here in Fort Myers. Headed by Mark Barber Barber, the shop has high sales and a 30-seat kitchen with a 24-hour grill and smoker. In February, the store hosted two grand opening events, including a bake sale.\n']"
574,US life expectancy climbs for first time in four years,"['WASHINGTON — The U.S. population age rose 0.7 percentage points in 2018, falling from the year before, according to new figures released Thursday.\nThe average life expectancy for Americans aged 55 and older increased for the eighth year in a row, from 54.3 in 2014 to 55.2 in 2018. That’s the most since 2002, when the average life expectancy for Americans aged 55 and older was 54.6, the National Center for Health Statistics said.\nBased on older Americans, the gains in life expectancy underscore the importance of programs to improve health.\n“When our nation’s population age as soon as we can, it increases its chances for a healthy person to survive life and make a healthy future,” said Timothy J. DiMaio, the senior vice president of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a news release.\nSpending on family and healthy living also improved significantly in the past 12 months, and in 2017, the U.S. increased spending on health services, DiMaio said.\nMedicare reimbursement for medical care slipped 1.3 percentage points in 2018, to $155 billion from $160 billion in 2017, according to the CDC. Spending on the Medicare program, which covers health care for people 65 and older, increased 4.1% in 2018.\nThe government has developed new ways to provide health care for the elderly in ways that allow them to earn and afford whatever medical care they need, said CDC spokesman Andy Byars.\n“This latest growth should provide these families with a lifeline to help them get back on track,” he said.\n']"
575,The mystery of President Trump's unannounced hospital visit,"['(CNN) - It\'s a mystery to some.\n""Who is this president?"" CNN\'s Gene Ryan asked on ""Question No. 2.""\n""I\'m wondering if the president\'s in the hospital because they\'re getting sick. Are the people at the hospital with them scared that he\'s being sneezed or would they be afraid?""\nYou can see a muddled picture on his Twitter account, with a busy tweet address: @govleak american.\nHis office says he has ""health care planning and administration management advice."" The Twitter handle @realDonaldTrump really only has @peaksout. The office doesn\'t immediately respond to CNN for Monday morning\'s scheduled questions.\nLast Friday, @realDonaldTrump went public with his hospital visit, tweeting about medical procedures and a mystery he wanted to keep to himself. The President\'s frequent tweets took many by surprise.\nAt the time, he also mentioned that his name didn\'t happen and that he was visiting doctors.\nIn a tweet on Monday, he said he was having ""bad start"" but was back at work the following day.\nOn Thursday, he tweeted ""Very nice work today!""\nOn Friday, he called on the staff to ""stop putting off that last one or getting scared.""\nSunday, he again referred to them not sharing details and asked: ""Is that nasty ..let me put that in context.""\nA tweet on Monday is really about Michael Jackson.\nMr. President, are you approaching anywhere with a smidge of nervousness?\n""I\'m excited that I\'m coming home,"" it\'s now rained all of the time.\nAre you seeing a ghost?\n""Yeah,"" Mr. President replies.\nA second tweet on Monday featured his ""says it like it is.""\nOn Sunday, a rep for the President criticized Twitter for shutting down coverage of his visit.\n""Ironically, a lot of people view the president\'s visit at this point as a precaution, according to his official press advisor Sarah Huckabee Sanders,"" Sanders tweeted.\nDemocrats said Trump needed to stop taking his job to a Washington hospital.\n""I would have ordered him to get to St. Mark\'s,"" Rep. Michael Grimm told CNN Sunday night. ""That was an acceptable procedure.""\nA House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on his travel and drug use also concluded Sunday night, despite skepticism from the White House.\n""I think it is important that a lot of people aware of this, that they know it took place for us to try and discipline him,"" Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., told CNN on Sunday.\nAnother factor in Trump\'s public challenge for the White House, however, is the seriousness of the illness that has cropped up over the past two weeks.\nAs some critics have noted, Trump\'s health has been consistently low-cost, with top surgeon general Andrew Welles saying he would not hesitate to order a private hospital in the White House, if that were the case.\nThen last week, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was looking for private hospitals, and that the city will provide them. The city official told CNN\'s Jake Tapper that ""I think there are a lot of ways that they might have sought that facility ... I think they\'re willing to deal with it, and I think they certainly feel as it pertains to the people who are bedridden at this hospital.""\nThe New York Post first reported the story, with de Blasio\'s office saying that while Trump\'s visit was his first, ""it was for an event that wasn\'t authorized by the commander in chief.""\nSo, apart from Monday\'s surprise, rumors will continue to swirl about Trump\'s health, with varying issues raised and hoped over the next few days.\nCBS News confirmed Monday that the president wasn\'t at the hospital but said that they are investigating. The network could not confirm if Trump is anywhere visiting, given the unusuality of his appearances and the length of time he\'s been on the air.\nCNN contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2019 by CNN NewSource.

576,"Dr. Sanjay Gupta on medical marijuana: We are in an age of wisdom, but also an age of foolishness","['NEW YORK (CNN) — Comedian and activist Dr. Sanjay Gupta of HBO’s “black-ish” is a neuroscientist, champion of medical marijuana.\nBut just like many of us, he’s not a medical marijuana user, despite consulting with and teaching at various medical agencies and clinics on his legal practice. And, at 74, he thinks more of himself is his best resource, according to a new column in People magazine, for having advice on how to behave against societal thought.\n“To get my facts right, it is appropriate to assume I was smoking dope from July 1 to October 3,” Gupta writes. “That is not the only time someone is smoking weed.”\nAnd he says that drug users today have a different set of priorities than did decades ago.\n“We were in our time of hubris, we were in my time of ridiculousness, we were in our time of superstition, we were in our time of foolishness,” he says. “We were all in our time, but we still were in our time.”\nAs a gay man, Gupta hopes to bring a little bit of relief to the “noble” people who work with him in his particular field. But in truth, doing our jobs is just as good for our safety, Gupta says.\n“We are all putters, and they don’t respect you if you do,” he says. “We make decisions based on our public health, because we know the impact on the environment is huge and the impact on the health and wellbeing of our communities.”\nSo when Gupta travels, he wears a holster he maintains at his local corner store and keeps it under his locker. Not that it’s all unfamiliar territory, though.\n“I can’t even imagine what these guys go through and what their lives are like without their real-life experiences,” he writes. “This is all part of what I’m here to teach.”\nBinge-watching TV shows like “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Scandal” remind Gupta of his own life story. They’re as true as the ever-present $30 television show that airs his stories.\nBut the most fascinating aspect of this story — at least as far as Gupta’s own life goes — is that it’s much harder to project the self-anonymity he is insisting on when he is pleading guilty to marijuana possession charges.\n“I felt I was going to be more anonymous, which I’m not,” he writes, but also remind that the recent FBI sting was also framed in the culture of informants wanting to weed out TV series.\n“I’m convinced that people might be committing more crimes and should know better,” he says. “Who knows? If somebody can look at this young man’s background, they might know more.”\n']"
577,"Sit, stand, sit: The new science about how to best use your standing desk","['Before I begin — and you know the answer — I need to share that right before I talk to you:\n1. Everyone has clearly said that ""all workers should have the same opportunity to have a standing desk."" But given that that so many of us were taught to be physical when we worked for work long ago, and may well not still be in it, sit is the best decision to make. Without fully realizing the science at hand, the truth is that in 15 months of training at the National Standards Institute it is no wonder that 43 percent of the American workforce is currently sitting — three times as many as the next most common way to sit is on the desk at work. In fact, if the college educated are to continue to support working together, we must do it every day.\n2. As humans, standing desks are precious treasures in our lives. Granted, this is a body of work that might be the American work culture\'s most successful field, but it is also true of standing desks: However difficult it may be to get to them, they are replete with physics and heroines who rejoice the triumph of what you can say with your feet. You need to know when you need to use them, in order to feel good about your own feet. If you are lonely, or alone at work, thinking about who to partner with if you need a better bench when suddenly finding you isn\'t easy, sit now and get used to it.\n3. Standing desks are famously popularized by Joanna Herring in the 1970s and the post-modern surrealist Joseph Pulitzer and Anna Kournikova in the 1990s. And certainly no tech-based heroines are aping them to stand — in fact, there are a host of confused and tepid ones out there who have begun to wonder whether, for the first time in our lives, we can be the complete best form of physical exercise. We must fall back to doing what we love and letting go of any inhibitions of staying upright. If standing desk isn\'t what you\'ve been working out for, just pick the start line and give yourself a good, pre-work routine:\nRelated: An adventure in muscle memory\n4. Standing desks are definitely not a male priority. The fast start-up of L\'Oreal has a reputation as the unsung hero of muscle memory — everywhere you look and smell your way around, your legs sound far ahead, your arms like they are moving their way out of you. Yet even as in, you feel a little sluggish — and I\'m not joking — standing with a super stiff leg doesn\'t just help you beat the clock — it makes you feel good about yourself.\n']"
578,"Not all screen time causes kids to underperform in school, study says","['Rebecca Black is right. It may be time for kids to start looking at screens a bit differently.\nAccording to a new study that published Monday in Pediatrics, kids who sit a low or four points behind their peers at school are much more likely to become delinquent in their assigned class.\nThose with less screen time are more likely to become delinquent within four years of graduation, according to the study\'s findings. For the rest of that time, kids aren\'t much better.\nThere\'s a basic reason why: kids, particularly those who do not have a lot of screen time, spend as much time sitting in front of television and computers as they do playing computer games.\n""An overly active child is a little less likely to get into school if he\'s exposed to other activities,” said study co-author Madeline Ellens, an associate professor at University of California at Davis School of Public Health.\nChildren with less screen time tend to get less emotional rest and social mobility, and also get worse in the long run, the study authors write.\nMeanwhile, those kids are clearly more prone to setbacks.\n“But this finding shows that that can certainly have a significant effect on behavior toward responsibility and response,” Ellens told CNN.\nHer study focuses on primary school children, and is not the first to say that shorter-than-normal screen time results in lower social mobility, which seems to be especially important in low-income communities.\nBut it points out that the study\'s conclusions don\'t mean our cultural biases behind screen time will stop.\nRather, it\'s likely to become the primary means of checking the kids in class. Schools, schools and kids will need to be more scrutinized.\nThe kids will need to feel they are contributing more, Ellens said.\n""Even though they need to be likelier to be in school and be proactive in supporting an array of behaviors we see on a daily basis — playing for an hour for a Friday afternoon, or watching TV in a 15-minute period for a period of time — eventually we\'ll begin to see broader declines than even this small but significant number of students,” the report said.\nThat means kids coming from less advantaged households will experience a relatively larger drop-off in social mobility, and that may have a big effect on ""an adolescent\'s ability to participate in and experience studies and parenting,” the report authors wrote.\n']"

580,Mixing less than 6 hours of sleep with chronic disease is deadly combo,"['(CNN) — In a study that included more than 34,000 people who took more than 6 hours of sleep a night, researchers found that people who slept fewer than the recommended 7 hours a night also had a higher risk of developing chronic disease.\n“We believe that when people become severely ill that their body’s biological clock changes between 7:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m., it plays an important role in chronic disease,” said the study’s senior author, Anthony Luh, M.D., lead author of the study and a board-certified general-market dentist who lives in the District of Columbia.\nLuh said a variety of factors may contribute to the health problems of the participants. For example, people have higher blood sugar levels in adulthood. Pain and stress may also play a role in maintaining a healthy immune system.\nBlood sugar in adults is common in adulthood, and immune systems can be more prone to “stress weapons” — such as food or medicine — that trigger chronic disease, Luh said.\nIn the latest research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Luh and his colleagues found that insomnia was the most common cause of death in such patients.\nOther researchers have shown that chronic symptoms and chronic disease are related.\nThe study focused on a group of 200 people.\nThose who complained of low body temperatures and low-quality sleep quality were shown to be higher risk of having multiple different chronic conditions that produced similar benefits.\nResearchers divided 2,485 people into two groups, those who had experienced no chronic disease or chronic sleep fatigue, and those who experienced no chronic disease and chronically ill.\nThe researchers found that patients who were affected by chronic disease had 30% higher levels of insomnia than patients who had slept about 7 hours a night.\nThose whose insomnia led to accidents or suicides were even more likely to have a risk of developing chronic disease compared to those who didn’t suffer from insomnia.\nThe risk of dying in the study is higher if people used a long, longer sleep schedule over the course of the study than if they were alone, said the study’s co-author, senior author Zorgy M. Geragos, M.D., a major research economist with the CDC and a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.\nThey did note that the lower sleep duration did not lead to higher cardiovascular risk.\n“But we think that isn’t enough to persuade anyone not to sleep the night before a doctor prescribes sleep apnea,” Geragos said.\nThe study cautioned against extrapolating where insomnia was on the table — it was too early to tell if patients at higher risk had shorter sleep schedules and were likely to be harmed by insomnia.\nBut the study’s conclusion that people who slept about 7 hours a night had a higher risk of developing chronic disease was broader than the findings earlier based on other studies, Geragos said.\n“If you don’t sleep during the week — like 12 hours a night — you’re probably going to end up having a higher chance of developing some type of chronic disease,” he said.\nThe researchers identified 14 common symptoms in patients who had chronic sleep issues: insomnia, chronic headaches, headaches and frequent flushing.\nThe one risk they found for chronic sleep issues were chronically ill individuals who had not slept at night.\nBut it was the effects of the conditions that were most common among the older participants — stroke, stroke — that was not widely known.\n“The biggest limitation of this study is that the participant respondents were all healthy,” Geragos said.\nHe said the researchers recommend people having nightly sleep for most of their lives, and he had no worries about keeping them all awake.\n“If you’re really in the throes of a high risk event, the things that protect you are the drugs and other treatments — recovery from physical or psychological trauma, or power loss — and then the antipsychotics and such,” he said.\n“Perhaps there will be more research to determine what’s going on in the disease, whether they have predictive value, whether they show meaningful improvements from an assessment standpoint.”\n']"

The DIY DIY medical biz worked with Mona Park of Salt Lake City and Michael Gallan of New Jersey to find a miracle cure.\nAfter calling his dad repeatedly as they tried to perform a bone-marrow transplant in 1988, they named their son Stoner. Stoner survives cancer, sleep normally and has a few puffy lesions, according to a story in the Salt Lake Tribune.\n“As the story goes, ‘Oh, well, why didn’t she find another tree?’” said Gary Titlock of New Jersey. “He managed to get the tree down to the top, and made sure it was propped up.”\nWhat happened next is anyone’s guess.\nThe North Coast couple called police but the cops came back calling them and determined to locate the tree, according to a story in the Salt Lake Tribune.\nThe man, who was 19-1/2 months, was recovering from surgery when they finally discovered the tree.\n“It looked kind of glamorous, but it wasn’t,” Titlock said. “It was like a white-knuckle set-up.”\nThe couple that called to find the tree were afraid that needles wouldn’t fall off and said it might break in a few seconds. Instead they did what many families do in less than a decade: Work with local animal control.\nDietitian Brian Brian Mason, director of the Food Safety Section of the National Center for Disease Control, said the family was very careful. They didn’t skimp on their “rattlers.”\n“If they’re storing something that can fall off someone’s clothing, they’re not going to put their toothpick and skew it,” Mason said. “And they’re not taking in a cutting method that requires almost the same kind of welding and cutting.”\nIn the end, the trio took almost as long as they’d dug a hole in the tree and used biopsy strips to mark the wound.\n“What impressed me more than anything was the patient’s dignity,” Titlock said. “It said all you need to know about recovery and how far you’ve come.”\nThe story of the Pioneer Child became popular after the 2005 documentary “Cops and robbers: The Video Gang Wars,” which chronicled a weeklong occupation by a gang of criminals, including robbery and murder, by the very groups described in the film.\nBoth men attended their first medical school together. Among other things, the Pioneer Child group taught social workers and women how to recite a swear word.\n“Our lives were forever changed by the legacy of the Pioneer Child,” Titlock said. “And that’s just what this story is about.”\nIt’s a story that has further touched the lives of doctors and society.\nBut Stoner’s story isn’t unique.\nIn the United States, thousands of people each year get the procedure. Some opt for IV lines. Some don’t. A recent study found that those experiencing infertility don’t even have to worry about needles causing their true reproductive dysfunction.\nYet, experts caution that people who get the procedure have a higher chance of developing complications such as postpartum depression, fertility problems, anxiety or/or low body weight, as well as behavioral and emotional complications.\n“Overall, what’s most important to understand is that, in an era when the Internet is going to be the latest social media, myths have advanced,” Titlock said. “And it’s by no means easy to do.”\n']"

When his father died, he would say, “forgive me for not knowing better.” He would tell us, “I will spend years and years now helping make a memorial to my daddy.”\nBut then, those words became fake, because Adam was never given the proper context, or proper family support, because Adam was dying, and he never had such a ring of support.\nHe would tell us, “I want to make my daddy proud of who I am.” Instead, Adam would tell us, “I’m happy to be my daddy’s girlfriend.”\nNeither of Adam’s two sisters — who aren’t named (in this case Adam) nor their children — were acquainted with his father, and so Adam ended up in his father’s arms.

Does he have a sense of who we are, or how he might have reached a place as grand as here in this story?\nMy journey of revelation opens a path, one not without its woes. Perhaps Adam’s death shed new light on his love for the Jews and perhaps that link altered who he really was, to believe that someone of Adam’s father’s stature may have been searching for the spirit of the man he loved the most and that he had lost all that he had loved.\nHowever, for all those who think that all this unhappiness and divisiveness are preparation for surrender to the corporate noise about the possible sale of British beef to Israel or the dissolution of the so-called Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, at least I have tried to understand Adam’s chosen issue by explaining how he and his father work together.\nI could set up clear rules that only the idea of their fate should be established, and then divide their battle among them on various levels.\nWhy would anyone support such a deal? At the core of it are the two Jewish leaders whose ideals include justice for the Jewish victims of genocide and a safer future for humanity. How could those two be in conflict?\nConsider the following solution:\nThe reason we chose to remain apart is to realize that we just can’t live without each other.\nIt does not matter that no one other than Adam’s parents have met the Nazis or that his parents have met those born from the Norwegian birthplaces. Neither of them seems to have had any time for planning. Neither of them seemed at peace.\nIf there was ever a time to meet, to form an understanding of one another, Adam certainly was one of them.\nWe knew he was a uniquely Jewish boy who wanted to break out of his parent’s arms and turn into the spirit of him, while remaining, in his, Jew’s, father’s arms, the most fabulous in Judaism. One might ask why Adam chose to break away, even because he thought he wanted to become an heir to a different family’s sins?\nIn his plea for God, Adam touched on such dark subjects as that of the Holocaust, and reveals as much when he describes his love for the ancestors of the poor and that of the sick, I THINK the way Jesus was blessed, for that was ultimately for all of us.\nAs he described those who tortured Adam, his father’s tragedy and his mother’s death, he refused to accept his destiny alone.\nThat’s a fate other Jews just have to fall in love with.\nT\n']"
585,Raising an intersex child: 'This is your body. ... There's nothing to be ashamed of',"[""SANFORD, Fla. - Men growing intersex body parts are no longer acceptable as parents-child advocates grapple with their children’s likely reaction to the practice, and raising the topic brought to light by a Florida patient.\nAs a result, several Florida families have petitioned their state legislature to require such practices to be prohibited in at least four different states: in multiple states; in three states; and in many other states.\n“For parents who are already concerned about their children's reaction to those parts being inserted into them, screening and medical procedures done for gender reassignment [is important],” said Dr. Cyril Coleman, director of the Center for Gender, Sexuality and Relationships at Children’s Hospital at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nColeman was among the first to respond to the Florida petition and asked his pediatrician to conduct a urine test to see if there was any evidence of the gender expression on children in his clinic.\nBut his daughter, and she happens to be seven months old, doesn’t seem surprised by the fact that her parents would like her to look at adult gender expression. “I had kids growing up straight… I said ‘You know what? A double gender multiple sexes up,’” Coleman said.\nWhen asked whether he believes gender expression on children is affected in his clinic, Coleman said “absolutely.”\nBut his recent campaign has created an international outcry, according to CNN affiliate WJXT in Florida.\n“I have my daughter born intersex,” a supporter wrote. “She was born straight. Why is that? What is wrong with her? She is not born with no clear disability.”\nAnd, “This is your body. ... There’s nothing to be ashamed of.”\nFamilies that have filed the local effort had a higher level of passion and commitment as they approached what seems to be a pivotal turning point for their discussions with parents.\nFor one particular doctor who knew about the view of intersex children and the impact it has on their symptoms, the involvement of a treatment provider sparked a passionate response from parents.\nThe efficacy of the therapy, and its prevention, were among the arguments parents lodged with their legislature.\nDr. John O’Brien, a vascular surgeon, said he had a child with one of the two female personalities, which is primarily males.\n“I felt like, to this point, this is a critical moment in my career, so I went to see my doctor and we discussed ways to start,” he said.\nA health professional who worked at an endocrinology clinic noticed a difference in patients’ perception about the implications of intersex-related genitals and even a non-psychological gender expression.\n“And if you are attracted to a non-diverse variety, it could be a barrier to treatment because you would want to know that you were attracted to someone else,” O’Brien said.\n“And then if they have their problem with that, it might also be a barrier for treatment because they may not have resources or services to address it because of the gender expression.”\nO’Brien recommends that parents consider whether their child can name their gender — whether a partner could even be identified in the patient’s name — or share information with their doctor.\nThe idea of accessing medical imaging to identify genitals is long ago considered obsolete. Today, dentists routinely perform cardiopulmonary, breathing and soft tissue examinations to measure the size and shape of the penis.\nOne of the most popular techniques is to have genital diversions measured, which appears to be the subject of worry.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends for parents, reproductive physicians and emergency room employees the creation of a free consultation program designed to test the possibility of a female gender in their children.\nTesting the results of the identification will involve the results of an external clinical panel funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which will examine the information and techniques used.\nPanelist Dr. David Kehler, a behavioral biology expert at Sanford Health, says that screening and gender evaluation for intersex children have always been very effective methods.\n“Many of the docs that I talked to at OB say it is a big issue and we feel like it has to be done right away,” Kehler said.\n""]"
586,Surprising factors that may keep you thin,"['If you look at your body composition in the five things you study most — nutrition, diet, exercise, and exercise. But for those of us who don’t diet, exercising and managing our body weight (and sleep), sleep deprivation (or, for any of the other ones that we look at, picking up and resting) can be factors for what goes on inside our bodies. And each of those factors might be another reason why you’re vulnerable to near-term cardiovascular problems.\nTraditionally, we study our body biology, and the work done on our bodies in order to measure the metabolic rate — which we then observe to evaluate trends in our muscle mass and/or heart health. But, finally, we get the idea that — when looking at our genetics, we don’t always see very good or bad things about ourselves, or anyone. So, our fate in the world can rest entirely on our genes.\nResearch has also shown that there are some special genes that inhibit life and the development of the body, and that people’s metabolism in the body may be impacted more by their metabolism than other genes. But, other genes may have significantly different costs for the body (at least in terms of health). That’s why, one of the most important factors that can cause a change in how a person metabolizes your body’s food (intraubercept, IL_16), another important factor in how metabolism works, is exposure to HIV. This infection is especially dangerous as HIV/AIDS itself is still very uncommon. You may take a cocktail of anti-HIV drugs either HIV or their type (Dehydroosis and Overheating), and continue to consume small amounts of these medications.\nSo, one of the important factors we are under here in the world, a known genetic difference between us, is that of connection between genes. Depending on the time it takes us to set the circadian rhythms of the body in order to differentiate ourselves from other humans, mutations can sometimes explain this weakness. So, perhaps when we’re talking about blood clotting, oral therapy or some other potential solutions, we should think about the connection between blood clotting, blood volume and flight that we’re getting from our bodies.\nLet’s start with our limits, pronto. At first glance, this may sound like gibberish. But there are really just a few other common patterns that seem to creep us to our limits at most. For example, two tests of hemoglobin affect the heart, and one of the first to do this is BPR (the standard blood measuring tool). So, it’s very possible that we can literally recognize ourselves as hot and humid in order to compensate for this. So, one of the main considerations to consider when thinking about maintenance of blood sugar levels is that BPR is caused by a release of sodium from cells. Perhaps this isn’t completely accurate, so we’ll have to monitor our health closely.\nDepending on the time it takes us to set the circadian rhythms of the body in order to differentiate ourselves from other humans, mutations can sometimes explain this weakness. So, perhaps when we’re talking about blood clotting, oral therapy or some other potential solutions, we should think about the connection between blood clotting, blood volume and flight that we’re getting from our bodies. We’ll have to monitor our health closely.\nBeing exposed to adverse events like heart attacks, strokes, or skin tumors may also make some people more likely to switch to other therapies, such as surgery or restorative treatments, to avoid a recurring blood clot. Those screenings are a small fraction of what we’re facing, and you don’t want to be spending much time worrying about your supply of medications or weight fluctuations.\nUltimately, health and sleep — which often results in long stretches of sleep or at least some good sleep — can shape the body’s ability to function in a deep way. Yours truly has to look at that as well.\n']"

That certainly has not stopped Ruby Bushes from craning her neck and scrutinizing her appointments.\nSince July, Bushes has been out on the town town with the likes of actor Scott Bakula, who’s on Oprah’s talk show and was recently named one of the new faces on the hit CBS show “Face the Nation.” She also has a 7-year-old son, Cristy, from her first marriage to Simon Sweet, and a three-year-old daughter, Jennifer.\nOver the past two years, Bushes has also landed herself in the spotlight with the Vito Cervantes-created photo of herself snuggling with two guys.\nTitled “She Careers,” Bushes spoke with her old friend Franklin Chamberlain, designer for Portrait by Nicolette Cole and designer of James Couture, for this week’s issue of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where she discussed her work with the fashion house and how it feels to work with a different brand every day.\n“I think I talk with [co-owner] Catherine Welsh, who really is a designer very private and extremely open to expressing whatever I want to,” Bushes told DeGeneres. “I know she’s really cool with women doing it because it just so happens that this woman is so hot and knows that she’s going to break something sacred.”\nGetting the job done, Bushes told the NBC host, is the best way to serve her family.\n“Getting a job is a journey of someone from every town who lives in a different city because we don’t have time to spend together.

590,Live Longer: Could you improve your lifespan?,"['(CNN) — Perhaps you used to know how big an impact a new brain can make on your lifespan, or at least a big part of it. And then you did it (without sounding crazy), only after your 20s. But do you really expect to live to 60? It could be just a thing.\nA new study published in Science explains that extending an age can be programmed with benefits such as improved body image, increased cognition and cognitive fitness. This could mean benefits in terms of hours of work and leisure, like attending any sporting event, including concerts, meeting new people, and engaging in more leisure activities, possibly even fitness sports such as walking.\nBut are human relationships going to last forever? That’s a topic worth talking about.\nAnd thanks to pharmaceutical companies, we don’t seem to be hearing much about the way we support aging people. The same way many doctors would like to see the quality of life observed by a person aging to 90, researchers in Sweden suggest that body composition might be critical to physical fitness. This means that obesity and exercise may influence blood pressures in future, so losing weight might have a bigger impact on the longevity of those in the midst of it.\nExercise is perhaps the most important factor for a person reaching 90, according to the economists who led the study. So it’s possible the increased lifespan can happen during a very young age: A study from 2009 looked at over a million people, and claimed that lifting weights, not standing, led to increased lifespan.\nThe researchers used independent computer models. They compared people with an age of 90, where 85% of them had no known physical activity, and observed that 60% had no known significant changes in weight or cognition. This meant that 81% of people had no changes in their lives — but half would have had no noticeable changes in longevity if not for the impact of their surroundings on their life goals, researchers said.\nWhich is actually great news, because you never know what you’re going to get up to in the future.\n']"

596,"On Friday the 13th we wonder why, scientifically, we believe in superstitions","['By Matt Evans and Michael Carrier\nWho says superstitions don’t matter? It doesn’t.\nBack in the 1930s, the Society for Magical Substances announced its affiliation with Ringle Music, and the conversation immediately revived the superstition that, in 1948, the detective Jeanette van der Jarvanen told scientists that “scientists always suggest … that the reason … . . . for somebody to be alive and live is because they believe in those things . . . . . I like to believe in it,” she said.\nThat’s not super science. It’s superstition. And we disagree with it.\nAs it turns out, there’s at least a somewhat higher level of science that says these superstitions matter. And yet—as the most radical iteration of the superstition appears in The Metaphysical Reserve, a conspiracy story that comes from abroad—the rest of the world does as well.\nSo where did we come up with this one? Through donations from occult practitioners abroad. Published in the 1960s, the book puts together a worldwide consensus, noting that “every year in 12 states, people begin to demand for a certain form of supernatural medicine.”\nThe issue takes a bizarre twist, however, with the United Kingdom’s Man In Tea International claiming that the superstition is the result of treaty. “This whole doctor thing is crazy,” a spokesperson for Man In Tea International told The Daily Mail of the group, which collects belief from around the world. “If people believe in some supernatural master that will prove them wrong for doing witchcraft.”\nHaving a distrust of the demon state is not a new form of superstition. Similar comments in the past have talked about fearmongering and what it means to be a madman, especially since we’re in the same frame of mind when it comes to belief in ghosts.\n“Why would people not trust that somebody who puts more money and energy into the making of you will survive when you die?” added one skeptic after hearing suggestions that superstition is rooted in greed or indomitable need.\n“Oh no, no, no, because I can’t feel bad about trusting people with not knowing about their self-worth,” added another skeptic.\nBut maybe it’s more nefarious. It could be just that, scientists realize.\nIf you’re one of those people who believes in superstitions, or are less likely to report them to you—when both of those points have been taken to extremes by skeptic groups—refer to The Metaphysical Reserve to Eeterolden, you’re basically for disobeying the superstition.\nCome to that conclusion, examine the evidence out there for yourself.\n']"
597,"Sleep anxiety and daylight saving time can exacerbate insomnia, but stretching may help","['Among other things, sleep is much easier to fall asleep on on those days when you’re so grateful you can’t get up. That’s because your brain is constantly rewiring its wiring to get ready for a long night. That long night’s bliss — followed by another and you’re glad you got that last meal — is not bliss on your day off.\nPicture this: If you wake up in the middle of the night, you spend $400, only to feel like you’re missing 5.5 hours, only to be awake again the next day, reading your best article or sitting on your couch by the bridge of a bridge of its own. Well, that’s not bliss on your day off. It’s sleep anxiety.\nThere are ways to re-adjust your sleep pattern to make it easier to sleep on those days when you’re so grateful you can’t get up. Writing a love note is a good start, but in order to be able to actually wake up on those mornings when they happen, you’d have to be in good health and have a level of sleep deprivation.\nMost researchers believe if a person has a compromised sleep schedule, it’s likely due to sleep apnea. You may be asphyxiated (e.g., forced to sit/stand for an hour/five hours), but so what? A history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. Regular exercise. Hormones they’re not born with. It’s not as if your body falls apart from other binging movies on the sofa.\nAssuming the same pathway is now part of your mind, know it’s a concerted effort to right your sleep cycles. Go to your personal doctor, sometimes speaking to your heart, usually anytime after a physical challenge. Remember to bring on china (for removing a loose book from the carpet, to decrease re-zoning) if you should even be feeling sick.\nRepost a love note for me below from the life of a pregnant woman who diagnosed with\nandrogen\nbad breath disorder.\nWe should all be grateful that when you wake up tomorrow, at least two hours later than the afternoons when you might be cranky, you’ll already have five more hours.

598,"For many Americans, the coronavirus pandemic means a normal life is on hold","['Medications that cause the dreaded flu may offer a glimpse of the deadly and debilitating illness that is sickening the American and, lately, even more people than usual. While flu season can be a bumpy ride, the global flu outbreak is far from over.\n“Last year, there were a record number of people infected with flu during the mildest season in history — but the virus has declined over the past few months,” CDC Director Tom Frieden said in a statement Wednesday. “We are now seeing lower viral load and fewer cases per year, and it is also showing signs of weakening.”\nAccording to CDC figures, two or three people will die of flu-related cause by this time next year, while the other half will become sick with illnesses likely linked to flu. An estimated 450,000 people who were sick with flu in 2016 in the U.S. have died. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the number of sick people includes as many as 500,000 infected by 2017.\nThere is a nasty bird flu virus called H5N1 avian influenza. This strain of avian influenza has an 85% chance of causing complete disfigurement or die. Who’s to say that the people we’ve seen in the press this season won’t be able to re-enter the rapidly evolving environment that they’ve termed “normal.”\nSo far, there have been a few serious complications related to the flu virus in the United States, including a scare in which a lab worker died of flu-like symptoms due to the flu. But unlike all the other illnesses they’ve spread through the air, H5N1 flu hasn’t so far developed on surfaces even of the gravelly sneezing form it strains.\nIt’s possible that the slow development of H5N1 caused a break in the virus’ global relationship to birds as it is now. In other words, the trend for the flu has appeared to shrink as a result of viral pools in both the U.S. and Canada. But in the way people usually die, a few are awfully late to die — yet another case of the flu.\nAnd when influenza can get worse, the chances of becoming infected is significant. Vaccination rates of childhood up to 18 months are typically passed through by adults — the CDC has attributed the rise in viral stress that causes death to a new vaccine that has not yet been approved. So, while flu-infected people often do not have a credible experience with flu, parents can still get the virus from other sources, including friends, family and businesses.\nFor many Americans, the coronavirus pandemic means a normal life is on hold.\nBut what if they die from a flu-like illness after too little protection?\nAccording to a published study by the National Center for Health Statistics, there are over 21,000 deaths linked to influenza in the U.S. over the past decade. At that rate, the flu could wind up killing more than 350,000 people by 2050.\nConsidering the number of people estimated to die of flu in the U.S. as a result of the H5N1 epidemic, don’t count on folks dying.\nTake it as a sign you may not be able to get the flu vaccine until someone has died of complications, such as pneumonia, left acute respiratory failure or kidney failure.\nWhat if something can be prevented?\nPoptromlike pain in the head is one of the worst common symptoms for people with flu. It can also be severe, like an eyes or mouth ulcer.\nIf you or your loved one are feeling particularly ill, try to think about what should happen next, but you know that causing a flu-like illness could be deadly.\n• If you haven’t had a good antiviral treatment recently, you may be a little too late, says a new study published in the journal Fluinfo.\n• If you like how long you’re sitting idle and feel sore or sick, feel plenty of pain — perhaps at work.\n']"
599,"'Prolonged, unprotected contact' led to first person-to-person coronavirus transmission in the US, study says","['SAN FRANCISCO (CNN) - Investigators have discovered a person-to-person travel/travel-to-home (GTP) transmission of human coronavirus in the United States, according to a new study.\nThe coronavirus in human test cases suggests that prolonged time spent in or near people during or during an GTP transmission may result in a longer and more virulent life-threatening infection of the gastrointestinal tract, researchers said.\nCape-cending case of a human case of coronavirus showed that individual patients infected with the virus between 1976 and 1994, who died during or after the initial infection, were nearly ten times more likely to transmit the virus to a second person, the study was reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\nThe virus can easily be passed from person to person in coughing, sneezing or mouth rashes, the study noted.\n""This is the first case to describe a significant and distinct link between two types of transmission,"" said lead author Dr. Ruth Hansen of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.\nIn addition to a brief history of human infection that ended in septic shock or death of a person who has died, chronic infectious disease transmission generally occurs over time, she said.\nBecause a virus is acquired by a person, viruses from flu can infect people, which means that people who have never had a disease experience a period of prolonged, unprotected contact with their body, the study said.\nThe second case of coronavirus between 1994 and 1994 found in the US ""may be an extension of typical ""travel"" travel to the country and a ""clinical hazard to people,"" Hansen and colleagues note.\nThe similarities between coronavirus and non-travel travelers account for their cross-symptoms, the findings said.\n""Another key point is that inter-human people rarely come into contact with their own body cells, which could lead to an increased risk of infectious diseases when all interaction is deemed to be preventable,"" Hansen and colleagues said.\nWhen the flu pandemic struck the U.S. in 2009, fewer than 20% of population was infected with the virus.\nAs of March, almost 15 million people had visited hospitals or emergency rooms during the flu pandemic, the new study said. That number is projected to rise as new cases become common.\nThe new study isn\'t the first to show that people who have traveled to the U.S. are at higher risk for viruses to infect their bodies.\nBut the new findings were the first to compare those travelers to people who had experienced symptoms similar to those people had died before sharing their hospital room with the infected other travelers.\nIn that case, who are still in hospital and who have been sick for the duration of the outbreak, another known risk factors for infection in the United States is no longer there.\nSo, the new results reinforce all of the points that it appeared that people are less susceptible to a flu pandemic because they do travel more frequently, the study found.\nBut no one yet knows for sure whether travel days traveled to the U.S. were as important as people traveled to other countries, the new study said.\n""It is much too early to tell,"" said Jody Adam, a professor of human infectious diseases and infectious diseases medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\nThe three countries that received the strongest cases of pre-existing viruses of which there were currently still only 20 cases spread to the U.S. by the 2008 and 2009 outbreak: Mexico, Australia, Italy and New Zealand.\nThere were also one new human case from Italy (planting the virus in the intestines of a patient in the hospital), two from Greece (coughing and vomiting of an infected person) and one from Vietnam (blood poisoning of an infected person in the hospital).\nIt is the first known case of a H5N1 coronavirus infection of a human, the new study found.\n""In the New York City area, coronavirus cases appeared to correlate with distance from transit,"" Hansen said.\nCopyright 2019 by CNN NewSource.

600,"Is it allergies, the flu or the coronavirus? How to tell the difference","['The New Year’s Day flu season is in full swing, and official travel warnings have been issued for one in four U.S. residents due to a potentially severe disease.\nIt\'s not known if the flu — if it is a respiratory illness or flu-like — has become more widespread this year, but experts are saying that respiratory disease is the most likely to have a lead to it. It may be simple to treat and neglect any symptoms, but there are still places you can safely put your immune system to work.\nHere are some of the most common symptoms and symptoms of flu:\n• Flu\n• Metaphors\n• Miracle or good coughing\n• More than 30 asthma attacks\n• Aperol without regular, cold baths\n• Red wine with good, fresh-squeezed caffeine\n• Pig, egg and milk in three-ounce bowls\n• Something magical or terrifying\n• Popcorn\n• Microcinium mouthwash\n• Angel spray\n• Salveigolf red with no warning (my friends think this can be hot or cold)\n• Runny nose\n• Left shaking or after nine hours of sleep\n• Accidentally falling asleep\n• Uncomfortably high or urinating\n• Obsessive fun\n• Fluffy snouts and exaggerated eyelashes\n• Eyes missing\n• Potions hanging\n• Disinfection dry\n• Hormonal fluctuations\n• Depression and other moods\n• Delayed night sleep\n• Drugs\n• Chemicals which cause headaches and sleeplessness\n• Bacterial skin infection\n• Siluble stents, electrocortons and other plastic stents in an object\n• More than 15,000 Americans are hospitalized each year due to flu-like symptoms, but even the majority of those with severe symptoms are still better off overall — right in the hands of their doctors.\nDr. James Quackenbush, Medical Director of Xanex-Optimism Inc. in Elliptical Eye Hospital in Houston, says ""The general attitude is that you\'re sick if you don\'t feel well in the evening, especially not when you\'re not being cognizant of where your heart is and where your asthma is.""\nQuackenbush adds that it takes over one hour after symptoms begin to flare up — but it\'s also worth mentioning that not all individuals are clamoring for major hospitalization. However, it\'s worth remembering that influenza is quite rare in the United States, so people should feel well if they\'re found to be ill and sick in a timely manner.\n""There is no effective immunity, no unique immune system that controls your immune system,"" Dr. Bruce Smith, vice president of the Division of Infectious Diseases at TB Risk Assessment Center, a division of the National Institutes of Health that advises on contracting and treatment of infectious diseases says. ""People who do not have a hot shower, hot meals or fruit in their evening meals, their nose is constantly itching and feeling tired.""\nFor more on flu, visit CDC\'s Web site.\n(CNN) — Flu season is heating up in the United States, and not just the riskiest season yet.\nThe Centers for Disease Control says that by the end of December, there was some evidence the flu might have reached epidemic proportions — and any weather event tied to the season could pose a risk to anyone trying to get sick.\nThere\'s not a lot of time to panic, the CDC says — you can easily raise your alarm through coughing or sneezing, but quickly ventilate yourself, according to the guidelines.\nWho\'s at risk?\nThe information on the flu cases you\'ve seen in recent months might give you some idea about who might be at risk, but researchers have still found people under 40 often have a relatively large risk of becoming flu-like symptoms.\nMost of those who get sick after starting a flu-like illness are either “weeping, lethargic or incoherent — with tired or breathless voices and very faint and unable to breathe,” says Sheila Siegfried, M.D., M.P.H., the flu medicine researcher at West Virginia University in Morgantown.\nTo catch the flu, the CDC recommends waiting until symptoms appear to affect the other symptoms, and stopping any breathing they do not normally go through. If symptoms aren\'t over one day, the CDC recommends waiting two or three days before any symptoms appear.\n']"
601,Broadway theaters to suspend all performances because of coronavirus,"[""Have you noticed one z or two people whose noses pop out in the toilets?\nWell, now those sirens are coming to Broadway.\nAt least, that’s what one Broadway theater decided to put in place Wednesday.\nSubdividli, a British baudette from the age of 80 that was touring the plays at the National Theatre in London, decided to suspend its performances at their regular venues for the rest of the week amid the coronavirus outbreak in South Korea and also for its unseasonably warm weather.\nThe tragic situation prompted the cancellations. The troupe at City of Hope, a New York City-based dance club, decided to risk it for an epiphany when it realized that it is being hit with a spike in gastrointestinal problems.\nThe incident, which started around 1:30 a.m. Friday, occurred as the troupe’s owners were celebrating the company’s posthumous Tony-award winning production of P.C.\nAnnette Bening, who won the Tony in “My Fair Lady,” was one of the first to notice the situation.\n“Suddenly she saw the play,” Bening told CNN’s Eric Stonestreet. “She was screaming and crying and screaming and screaming. Then she said, ‘Who is this this moment?’ ”\nDisappointing as the company’s production had been until Wednesday, Bening had been sat in a small set with a security guard who was about to leave her.\n“She said, ‘I need to go’ but to her dismay, she started looking for someone else to sit on the floor,” Bening said. “She stood there, pointed to the floor, and she realized that it was the first time that’s happened in two months.”\nAs the incident unfolded, another security guard arrived on stage and discreetly asked, “Did they notify you?”\n“Who replied, I didn’t know, but that’s OK because it’s not unusual,” Bening told Stonestreet. “That’s life after the Olympics.”\n“It was the first time I’ve ever been on stage in the same theater,” she added. “I knew there was going to be a tragedy, but to see these people’s faces and their mouths, that’s what I remember.”\nThe scene unfolded.\n“I sat there, the security guard sat next to me, telling me, ‘Keep away, don’t get up there; if you get on the floor, it’s dead,’” Bening said. “And he said, ‘Oh, your face looks like a flower!’”\n“I looked at him and he stared at me. ‘I’m so sorry,'” Bening said. “And he said, ‘OK,'” she said. “And then I realized the shots were just being taken by security guards.”\nBening reached out to a hotel clerk who was among the others crying out to her about the troubles. She said the only time she heard him was when a security guard approached her and apologized.\n“So, my heart felt like a glacier because I knew it would be the most tragic incident,” Bening said. “I was told at a certain point, ‘The show is going to close because of this.'”\nShe decided not to do the show anymore, but rather said “I’m going to go to the theater that I love, then to the larger theater, where I’m more focused on art and music and relationships,” she said.\n""]"

603,"Babies smell 'sweet,' teens stink and blindfolded moms can tell the difference, study says","['Researchers are trying to disprove as clear as possible that the smell of infants in the dark is a hazard to their health and behavior.\nA newborn’s heartbeat, up close and in the face, and their cognitive behavioral qualities are measured using computer algorithms “can give us certain cues to detect if those cues are associated with a nursing injury,” lead researcher Tanya Lang, from the University of Ulster in Northern Ireland, told reporters.\nUsing automated programing, Lang and colleagues have discovered the two-parent, non-transparent infants behaved similarly to what their parents would normally do in a quality-of-life environment. The healthy infants did so in a wild-like manner. The hooked infants did so in a different, more lit, condition.\nBecause kids appear to be more sensitive to the sounds of a scent, the researchers used the same algorithm that was used in the experiment to measure how well their mothers were sleeping.\nSigns\nAs Lang and her colleagues pointed out in the team’s abstract published on Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics, babies in the dark may seem to smell stronger than infants in a very open environment.\nLang and her colleagues examined five different groups of newborns over the past year to simulate the full system, using computing and text inputs.\nOne of the first findings was that the soft-haired babies in the dark were more sensitive to noise and odors. All of the babies spent at least three days in a darkened nursery.\nThe second significant finding was that the bright mothers were more attentive to environments with sound, such as the bright, noisy nursery.\nThe third finding was that the girls’ performances had more color, taste, and brightness when provided by each other. The young mothers were 10 percent more likely to crave savory sweets than the parents.\nThe findings could be incorporated into babies’ babies’ and babies’ babies’ bodies.\nAll five babies who participated in the study had respiratory difficulties. All had multi-drug resistant infections.\n“These findings make it obvious that when babies and children are in the lab, we have to ask the complex questions that a lot of parents don’t ask. We must ask the complex questions in order to know whether someone is bothering an infant or not,” said Linette McGuire, co-director of infectious diseases and economics at the school of veterinary medicine at UUP.\nTo test for color\nLang took different photographs of the infants in the dark and diagnosed them with an infection on the babies’ back, neck and head.\nThe blood test was generated using a catheter used for diagnostic purposes. Using the catheter to control the infection led to detection of a type of thrombocytopenia, a serious lung disorder linked to susceptibility to infections such as thrombocytopenia.\nLang and her colleagues tested 10 infants with thrombocytopenia—a common form of infections—on the Eelbarase automated selection system. The older infants had matted hair and dry skin.\nResearchers determined which infants were most sensitive to temperature and humidity. The older babies and infants both had brown hair and slimmer noses. The researchers then analyzed their brain activity, consumption of a variety of sensors and medications, and their developmental trajectories.\nThose in the dark rated highly on a variety of complex programming measures, but preferred different comfort settings—the plush, comfortable environment, the loud toys. It is possible the researchers found the infants at home who did not see faces the way adults did.\n“It could have been that some of the children hadn’t smelled. The babies didn’t smell,” McGuire said.\nThe researchers theorize that when children are exposed to different stimuli they notice them out of the blue.\n“It could be they were napping, or it could be they were playing outside,” McGuire said.\n']"

606,"Children's coronavirus cases are not as severe, but that doesn't make them less serious","['After two decades and thousands of cases, the alarming numbers of children’s coronavirus (search for T.V.E.) cases are nothing short of astonishing.\nNot surprisingly, the seriousness of the numbers continues to mount. In April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 2,331 new cases of T.V.E. in the U.S. (2,808 children were referred for evaluation), up 34% from April 2016. So even if only one child is admitted (like 3 cases were reported last month for two large children), at least seven cases represent a large population. How? Simply put, it is a shocking growing rate.\nWhat is surprising is that the number of new cases is significant even though there were no statistical differences in the number of cases over the last two decades.\nThe CDC estimates that 2,334 children were tested for the virus during the first 10 years of development, meaning that, for every additional case of T.V.E. detected, there will be at least two more children diagnosed with the virus. This even after the CDC repeatedly and unambiguously stating that you can be sure the T.V.E. will become more prevalent.\nWho were the carriers?\nTo understand the perils of this new outbreak, consider two important facts. First, the children who were tested for the Zika virus had not yet been diagnosed with the virus. Third, because the CDC had warned that cases could increase following the release of the Zika virus in the U.S., the number of children whose potential destinations were changed by the mother’s transmission to her child increased following the release of the Zika virus in the U.S. In any case, it is alarming to see the extent of the potentially significant increase in victims’ cases.\nWhat exactly is the likely cause of the large increase in children’s cases in the past decade?\nA few things have been pointing the way:\nThe growth of the number of T.V.E. cases has been slowing, although the CDC has said that the increase in cases was “addressed to the increase in travel patterns” and “‘the potential shift in perceived health risks has not yet been addressed.’ This has led to an increase in the proportion of children who are tested for the virus who have received vaccines. In addition, the CDC estimates that only one child per 10,000 children was tested as a result of the Zika virus last year.\nThe CDC hasn’t yet drawn any conclusions about why the rise of the Zika virus over the last decade was such a massive increase. In fact, it is something else entirely.\nDr. Kathleen Sikkema, CDC’s chief scientist and director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Zika Virus Branch, hinted at the likelihood of a combination of factors in the outbreak, but added, “We do not believe that the increase in the number of people infected due to the Zika virus is a sign of an epidemic or a pandemic.” It may be true that the virus has grown exponentially from being passed around the world.\nBut anyone who thinks the Zika epidemic will extend to the U.S. is overstating it entirely. Less than 10 percent of Americans carry the virus, and babies born to mothers infected with the virus are three times more likely to develop an infection later in life.\nIf we don’t want to worry about the number of women who unknowingly carry the virus, we have to start carefully studying the risks at other parts of the globe. We also have to focus on women who have never had sex or who don’t know how to manage children with Zika.\nIf there were any damage caused by Zika, the CDC would not be alarmed. But the CDC is carefully evaluating the risk at another part of the globe that brings the virus to those states, including countries with similar restrictions. So there is no reason to view all the cases as one person spreading the virus.\nIt has already been more than a decade since T.V.E. was initially detected, and the CDC estimates that “all screenings were positive for Zika during the first decade of the outbreak, and only one mother had contracted the disease during the first six months of the epidemic.” The CDC does not believe that the increased vaccination rates are necessarily a result of pertussis.\nThe more important takeaway is that Zika does have a strong link to any form of childhood diseases. This could even be its downfall.\n']"
607,Lessons from Ebola: The secret of successful epidemic response,"['We all dread the dark days of Ebola yet mortality rates are high.\nThis year, Ebola has carried at least 141 dead and feared lives worth more than $3 billion. We aren’t even clear whether or not it was simply the fear of an overwhelming body count—vicious in its own right, as could be true of any outbreak. Either the risk of dying and presumed death are receding or inaction by the public health system is becoming commonplace as well.\nSome simple steps—using public knowledge more than seen in the “official” CDC newsletter—were one step toward preventing Ebola. Sadly, as the CDC studies in bigger and more nuanced language take our medical database to heart, we are missing the apparent path to preventable deaths and, more important, avoidable lives.\nThe interconnectedness of all health systems is leading to short-term tragedy, which can lead to longer-term consequences.\nIn the 2017 outbreak’s second outbreak, estimated at more than 157,000 cases of Ebola, that caught the private sector off guard, the response was followed by a multi-year mismanagement which resulted in an outbreak/decline of virus. To date, only 15 cases have been confirmed and an additional 1,610 deaths have been classified as probable. Even though most of those involved the health sector, which is implicated by large numbers of international partners and pressure on our borders, are strangers to many countries, the country response was never in a position to respond well enough.\nThis is why we need to raise our awareness about outbreaks and the need to prepare. Two and a half decades in the “advanced care and control system” infrastructure has led to no real response by health entities or providers. It is past time to change the culture and begin the paradigm shift.\nLike many major crises, Ebola is transmitting its treatment and containment protocol from farm to factory, without our knowledge or regard for who has contracted and did so. We know and often rely on messages that inform patients that crisis is imminent but don’t always manage to ensure their needs are met.\nThese messages are finally receiving their intended safety vectors: cholera, diarrhea, fever, shock, and abnormal tests. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is focused on prevention efforts, they are not within our grasp. We need to raise our awareness, engage with the health sector on steps we can take to ensure that the truth of the outbreak is known and recognized and streamlined for health care and well-being, and also we need to make the most effective options available to people, organizations, and government.\nWe need to talk about how we best prepare the public for such disasters, such as Ebola and like the Drought Storrs. In 2009, a Drought Storrs team estimated that it cost about $2.5 million to respond to the resulting outbreak. In the aftermath of 2008, when the Drought Storrs team was completely overwhelmed by the amount of response, CDC mobilized emergency medical responses to the entire country. A 2015 report from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention calls these efforts “one of the most effective ways in which we’ve mobilized our healthcare system to respond to an epidemic.”\nWe need to build in strong communications, risk avoidance mechanisms, and resources that help coordinate and coordinate, as well as activate networks that assist across healthcare systems, government, and institutions.\nWe need to translate our way of communicating with the medical community so that it is true to what is clear in a state of urgency, and something more tangible, so that the public knows. To step back and readjust the lessons learned in recovery is of immense importance. While post-eclampsia patients in the outbreak don’t die yet, they will shortly, and we will see when so many others will, the inevitable labor for discussion about our nation’s health status, its politics, our differences, and our ability to respond effectively.\nAs Ebola continues to grow, it will be difficult to avoid any contagion. We need to support and help coordinate what it takes to provide the best resources and help to develop strategies to combat this great epidemic.\nDr. Mehmet Oz, an infectious disease epidemiologist with UC Riverside, conducted initial reports on the outbreak in a talk and reaction to the press conference at the White House.\nThe post Lessons from Ebola: The secret of successful epidemic response appeared first on SoCal Times.\n']"
608,'They didn't protect us' say some first responders for coronavirus,"['A recent effort by the fire department of Kansas City, Missouri is increasing the reach of the deadly coronavirus, something many of us may not have known or fully understood before.\nJust this week, a black cloud of debris began to pile up from the rubble of a barn that had been razed to the ground by a wildfire in KC and other cities. Just days earlier, first responders from Burlington, Vermont, began their work of finding an incubator that can cure the same deadly and viral virus that claimed the lives of 108 people in London.\nThe devastation in that city comes at a time when the military and police departments have been slashing funding for the general public to help fight the deadly coronavirus and other viruses, including Zika, heartworm and the Zika virus.\nThe wildfires that started in New York City this week also contributed to the fire\'s impact, in an effort by authorities to curb Zika and other infectious diseases.\nThis dustup has repeatedly highlighted the damage being done by coronavirus during a crisis, and through misinformation and faulty marketing, particularly when it comes to hurricanes.\nLast week, Kansas City Police Department tweeted that a second fire within miles of the turbine barn was caused by an ""activity hazard"" that ignited in the shed\'s sheds.\n""Based on the existing safety measures, a second fire in several hundred yards from the turbine barn prompted a second fire within three hundred yards that ultimately caused smoke damage to the sheds and roof,"" the department said.\nAs part of its response to the fire, fire companies from Princeton, Missouri and Lawrence, Kansas, which fought fires under the umbrella of the North Country Fire Protection District, announced a new six-month campaign targeting ""aggressive practices"" -- including additional firefighters and police on the job.\n""Although each program has a different approach to tackle root causes of infection, our approach, as we have been doing during these fires, is focused on taking immediate action at these area communities and saving lives,"" company spokeswoman Jessica Kure told CNN.\nBut even after those safety measures were in place, fire departments have had a difficult time containing the cases in their own communities.\nThe infectious disease infects thousands of mosquitoes that are used as an infected mosquito and its spores thrive in stagnant water. When infected mosquitoes are flushed from the water, these water-borne viruses bond to their host.\nOfficials aren\'t letting the tide pass them by because of this aspect of the coronavirus, but instead, they are trying to figure out ways to isolate those living in the reconditioned barns so they can be integrated into those who might be affected by the virus, Kure said.\nWhen the first wave of deaths occurred in the two counties of Johnson and Lee, employees wrote that there were 14 patients out of nearly 1,300 people born alive, several who were exposed to or had been exposed to coronavirus. More than 5,000 people were infected with the virus.\nThe type of vaccines for the virus in the vaccines that are given out are still under review by the FDA, Kure said.\nThe culture team at the Kansas City fire district has been working with several laboratories in the City of Kansas City, Kansas, and affected local hospitals, she said.\nHowever, having sent out a cease-and-desist letter requesting that ""the public be notified by their doctor that they may not access any locally sourced vaccine, should they start receiving the very new vaccines.""\n""You\'re in the middle of a whole season of #Kownunsactiveness and the CDC is still waiting to hear back on your request,"" she said.\n""We haven\'t received any ""calls, we have not received an \'event,\'"" Kure added.\nIn Texas, emergency managers are dealing with the influx of hepatitis C virus infections and some cancellations. Texas Emergency Management Agency Vice Chairman Gov. Greg Abbott was criticized for at times avoiding addressing the issue and referred to as ""bad management.""\nWith the upcoming wildfires, a hot and humid Florida, Michigan and other hot climates, the job becomes harder, officials have said.\n""We see an increased need for change in our emergency management capabilities, in planning, and in coordination with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies,"" they said.\n']"
609,How to keep your workplace clean -- and yourself healthy -- during the novel coronavirus outbreak,"['(CNN) -- Four months after the swine flu pandemic began, many medical professionals say it\'s not too late to be alert for the next great outbreak.\nAfter state health officials continue to warn about swine flu-like illnesses, policy makers in Pennsylvania, Iowa, North Carolina, Kansas, Tennessee and South Carolina have floated the idea of stepping up their efforts to protect workers, their families and their employers from becoming victims of the outbreaks.\nHow do you keep yourself and your coworkers away from a swine flu outbreak? Here are three steps to help avoid the virus:\n1. Start following the playbook\nIt\'s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that the latest outbreak was random, that the virus\'s not going to hit everybody every time. However, experts say that\'s not the case. Humans, like non-human primates, don\'t transmit directly from person to person -- so it\'s best to start preparing for the worst with a list of everything you can do to reduce the likelihood of getting caught.\nThat\'s particularly true if you have children -- the risk of your employees catching a virus like swine flu does not spread from person to person easily -- and a family member of your family is missing out on many of the other things you can do to prevent similar illnesses.\nMost importantly, develop a ""common sense"" plan for the workplace that includes protocols and precautions to avoid any possible cases of the virus.\nThis includes:\nGetting out more of the information -- or whatever other precautions are in place and not in place.\nRemind yourself that the outbreak is real and many health workers and consumers are fearful of contracting the virus. Keep your fears in the past, and do not carry panic buttons to the door.\nReinstating checks at the office will help prevent the appearance of a health concern. That\'s especially true if you follow the provisions of manufacturer recalls or if work involves heavy-duty manufacturing equipment.\nBeing in a strong position to deal with an outbreak can make the difference between surviving or surviving out the next pandemic.\n2. Embrace energy loss\nWhile employees have a great deal of energy to store, regular doses of available energy can diminish the reach of the outbreak and contribute to the danger. Taking such energy away from workers may prevent a swine flu outbreak, for example.\nOne suggestion from authorities is to eliminate and recycle any food containers left unattended while workers are indoors. If you choose to keep any food for an extended period, report each time to the director of food services at your local Wal-Mart.\nPeople are well-versed in keeping cool and dry, but it pays to be mindful of your behaviors. Try to remember all the things you use, and remember that it\'s your body\'s job to keep yourself cool. Never, ever take anything while working in a storm -- especially when it\'s in the early afternoon.\n3. Take it slow\nWith the coming winter, many farms and workplaces across the country have millions of pounds of dry goods to produce. That\'s why it\'s best to know what products you can keep and what food you can store. Consider buying items like plastic wrap, jugs and black plastic bottoms from home-made retailers and wholesalers.\nTraveling with some fresh necessities when a campus caddy arrives after a long day at work is more pleasant than staying in the backseat or side dining room. What you may not consider is the inevitable death of your boss. Making the adjustment now is easier if you can get it right now.\nAnd if you find yourself keeping your cool, bring a turkey (or other small red meat animal for you) or any small food item and prepare it in advance.\nWhen prepared properly, it\'s better to ensure that you\'re finding small pieces of food that\'re less in need of removal or keeping them refrigerated and in place during the case of a swine flu outbreak.\nWhen you\'re growing your own food, you can almost always get fewer green juices because more food is needed, so that could help preserve the healthy balance.\nBe aware of what\'s in a food bag -- and be aware of plenty of other things like frozen fruits, vegetables and canned meats.\n']"
610,Why CNN is calling the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic,"['By Tanya Agrawal\n» More Columns\nLate last week, we warned people that we needed to see a few people stricken with a bluish or black patch of the virus in their home as soon as they come out of bed, and warned about it possible for them to get sick. That’s usually when there’s a pandemic that has sweeping populations and global scale to that point.\nBut there was a possibly contagious infection in one particular location. And that’s not just something that you can be very worried about at the moment. Most people in need of assistance get it only once or twice in their lives, to be perfectly accurate.\nIf that’s the case in my situation, I’d prefer to see someone else isolated and already delirious.\nThese days, more and more people are getting infected. I see it all the time from all directions.\nI know that sharing needles in my local mall, and why people have had to go to the doctor to find infectious agents, like this form of the flu, is common. But I don’t know the reasons why someone just ditches a needle and picks up the very next needle, or something like that.\nAs for how often people would get sick? It varies. As many as three to five times a year. But even if we don’t think this has happened to someone as great as me, I’d be surprised if it wasn’t more common in an apartment building or conference room, parking lots or parks. It’s one of those things you can’t usually rely on in an emergency. Even if you imagine that’s the case, you might not go to the doctor’s unless you consider that at least a couple of days after getting sick, that you are less likely to have symptoms.\nSo if you didn’t go to the doctor to be diagnosed or keep a medical student in touch with the family, why wouldn’t you try the first thing out?\nI was with my wife last week and her husband was coming home, and we have two young boys. Both boys couldn’t make it, so we decided to get together before school and catch up on information, and we needed to get some fresh air.\nAnd it came around. All about those symptoms. They had so many! And they had so much food and vegetables, although I think I was too young for those things when you become sick.\nI’m the most famous person in the world because everyone identifies with me. Nobody carries it all together just for fame, because people know exactly what’s on the other end of the phone, just under the neck of the phone, if I go missing and I know what’s happening.\nWe’re all in this together, but this has become the most important thing because this affects everybody’s life because we feel like we belong.\nWhat better way to start an international scare than to say, at a banquet, I may have something to say, and I might offer a concrete course of action? Well, that would be something we could all study together for further consideration. That’s the kind of thing one can take seriously in emergencies, and hopefully someone can offer as much detail about these types of diseases as possible.\nAnd if you actually were to have a medical student in hospital, just tell her, as we don’t know how we are living, what you need to know. I don’t know how to help you, but to tell her you’re staying and saying, “Look, I’m suffering from the flu. Am I going to have a cure?”\nAnd it will be there in the end because you’re hoping someone might hear about it, in your bid to stop this from happening to you, rather than another epidemic.\nI’m going to do something with my phone, I’m not going to miss the eight o’clock news tomorrow night. I’m going to share with my viewers how exactly this might be connected to our current pandemic.\nBut when I see someone about it, I have to say, “Wow, this is possibly going to be a new Santa Claus.”\n']"
611,Syrians are in a desperate race to outrun a brutal regime offensive,"['The Syrian government is battling an offensive meant to encircle its Sunni Muslim stronghold of Latakia province as President Bashar al-Assad loses control of his hometown.\nBut making such an offensive across the country is likely to fail: al-Assad must either win outright or the Syrian population will grow increasingly disillusioned and excluded from the process.\nAfter 11 years of civil war and under Arab and international pressure, this January marks the first time since the UN-Arab League\'s sanctions imposed on the regime that it has turned to its allies to defend the largest minority in Syria\'s 28-year civil war.\nOver the past three months, at least 18 civilians, military and security personnel, Shiite and Sunni, and most of the city\'s Sunni population have been killed in the offensive.\nThe regime\'s soldiers have also been using anti-aircraft missiles to target civilian target areas, artillery and tanks.\nWhen President Bashar al-Assad made the aerial assault last month, it seemed to be a direct attempt to prevent a more bloody day for the Syrian people.\nAlready, Assad\'s air force has air-dropped heavy weaponry to residents of Qaraqosh in northern Idlib province.\nEarlier this week, an air defense convoy also bombed some neighbourhoods in the city of Aleppo, killing at least 50 people.\nInside Aleppo, streets are ablaze with bodies strewn across them and looting shops. They are suffering from seasonal violence that has killed at least 108 people.\nJust a week after airstrikes killed at least 125 civilians, Ali Abdulla, the mayor of Madaya in northwestern Idlib province, was unharmed.\nSince February this year, the city has seen 22 ceasefires for a time, with the most recent involving the cease-fire on March 26. This has eluded the government.\nAll Assad\'s forces have claimed the use of artillery, tanks and mortars to defend himself, since ISIS in its eastern region of Syria gained control of Raqqa and then retook parts of the northern city of Deir el-Zour in October.\nBut each side has an advantage in airstrikes, and the most recent offensive offers civilians an opportunity to gather their memories of their days in a largely empty city, which is a poorer and potentially bloodier place.\nHere is what we know about a timeline of Syria\'s offensive:\nBattle: March 11, 2011\nWhen Al-Assad was on the verge of winning the popular vote to form a new government in March 2011, his Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) was being backed by the Arab League, the United States and Russia.\nJihadists were a threat to Damascus in the run-up to the April 2011 elections, prompting the leadership of the PFLP to issue a gazette notice that they were already in control of town of Sharm el-Sheikh, ""in anticipation of capturing by the Syrian army.""\nThe Islamist Hizbullah movement was the precursor to the Alawite militia, an offshoot of Shiite Islam, that officially supported Assad.\nThe forces of Hizbullah now controls many of Assad\'s strongholds in the province of Idlib.\nThe forces of Hizbullah routed the regime in August 2011 and formed a coalition with the military and foreign fighters of hardline Shiite jihadist group Hizbullah.\nThis war was televised in which more than 70,000 people died.\nAt the time, Hizbullah and Hizbullah are considered close allies in the Syrian civil war.\n']"

Last month, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, Iran’s military wing, and its intelligence chiefs compared the practice to the practice of every individual to be buried with ashes in the living grave.\nLast month, 11 bodies were found last week. “The government does not participate in grave excavations without Israeli participation,” said a woman identified as Bahram Qumari, the head of the Iranian Interior Ministry’s news site, Alarain.\nIranian al Qaeda assassinated Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on April 3, killing the leader of Iran’s Al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Qari Jafari.\nThe Iranian government has so far not decided who will be the next head of the organization, but the Ministry of Intelligence has said “They (the Islamic Republic) know who will succeed us.”\n']"

The new strain is likely to be difficult to spot because of rising temperatures.\nGovernment officials estimate that new strains of coronavirus typically emerge from labs and laboratories around the world. But the problem involves finding infectious agents and mumps, typhoid fever and vermin and human papillomavirus that are both common.\nThe problems that plague such groups are rare. There are only about 800 laboratories worldwide in medicine and research that are run by Iran\'s own government.\nIn Iran, nearly six out of every 10 researchers remain at the National Iranian Medical Board, which supervises the Hina Initiative.\nIran\'s government even works at the National Institute of Biomedical Sciences in the city of Isfahan.\nAs for the Hina Research Initiative, it\'s a variation of Iran\'s government-funded Health Promotion Organization, and is run by the health minister. Officials there deny that their diseases are taken by the official government, but say Hina is run of independent means by his government.\nFor now, the local death toll is likely to rise, NIFA spokesman Gholamhossein Shaherzadeh told CNN on Thursday.

615,UN nuclear watchdog finds Iran has nearly tripled its uranium stockpile,"['DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (CNN) — The United Nations nuclear watchdog has long recommended the International Atomic Energy Agency develop a longer-term, cross-border verification process to verify Iran’s compliance with its latest nuclear deal with world powers.\nBut its renewed concerns regarding Tehran are mainly because Iran was singled out by the IAEA for so long, allocating 2.2 metric tons of their highly enriched uranium to Iran this year — nearly nine times the previous year’s allocation.\nIn recent days, critics in the IAEA made pushbacks about the IAEA’s overall findings, including whether Iran had indeed diverted some of the uranium to its main supplier, or an additional amount.\nThe objections came amid arguments in Europe and North Korea over the wisdom of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s hard-line stance toward the West and the future of the nuclear agreement, despite a U.S. Supreme Court decision to uphold the deal that specifies Iran’s nuclear activity will be restricted to peaceful purposes and not military, part of a negotiated nuclear deal.\nIn its July report, the IAEA found Iran was sharing still more than 2 metric tons of its enriched uranium to Kazakhstan. “Resumption of this activity is expected in late 2020, as measures are under development. Such a pace of activity would result in the necessary necessary volume of Iranian uranium to be produced, but would need to be approved by the IAEA,” the agency said.\nCiting a U.S. intelligence assessment, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on Iran to suspend uranium enrichment in the second half of the year after some results weren’t obtained.\nIn a letter released Wednesday, Pompeo urged Iran to suspend non-nuclear activities for a total of five years. He said Iran had been requesting additional deliveries to come “around 2021,” including more targeting of targets in the so-called “dirty powers.”\nThe U.S. agreement provides that Iran will “explore” a “coherent cooperation program” to restart enrichment of uranium and conduct civil nuclear work, although the “secretory program” is an intended endgame.\nPompeo is also calling on Iran to “take advantage of existing technical and information gaps and cooperation arrangements, including the resumption of nuclear activities and agreed step-by-step verification to create a threshold for verification of Iranian compliance” within the next two years.\nIran’s top leaders did not attend the Monday Paris climate change talks. And Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif cautioned the country’s leaders against their outreach to the international community.\nIran denies any role in its nuclear program and denies it is seeking to build atomic weapons. But it says it wants only peaceful nuclear energy, including by developing uranium for fuel.\n']"
616,"Trump's Middle East plan could jeopardize Jordan-Israel peace treaty, Jordan PM says","['WASHINGTON (CNN) — President Donald Trump\'s Middle East peace plan to achieve a durable ceasefire with Israel by resolving long-standing disputes could potentially imperil peace hopes in Jordan and Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told CNN\'s Brianna Keilar on Sunday.\nThe Israeli PM, who enjoys growing support in Arab states due to his handling of the Middle East diplomacy during the Obama administration, said Trump could be mistaken if he doesn\'t consult his party leaders and community in announcing the new peace proposal.\nTrump\'s June 12 summit with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu under the auspices of the Quartet of the U.S., Russia, China, France and the United Nations had largely turned into a battlefield in which the leaders discussed the issues of border security, regional peace and Jerusalem, and more specifically whether to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\nTrump\'s meeting with Netanyahu is the first since the other U.S. government officials last month said the new plan would lead to an Israel-Jordan humanitarian co-operation, two major issues that had been at the heart of its negotiations.\nThough it signaled a willingness to walk away from early stage deals that have been in place for decades, Netanyahu said Trump\'s proposals are ""no longer an obstacle to peace"".\n""If you wait too long, it will find itself telling Israelis and Palestinians that \'Lionel, it\'s no longer the end of the road\'."" Netanyahu said.\nThe joint statement, released earlier on Sunday after a State Department media briefing, said Trump\'s proposal does not undermine or decrease the ""shifting international authority on Jerusalem,"" where Israel holds most of the land around the Jewish city.\nUnder the new proposal, a Palestinian state will be created in exchange for an agreement that can be made by a negotiated Palestinian-Israeli two-state peace process. It also would recognise Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital, bypassing regional and international agreements that had rejected it and offered to deal with ""the East Jerusalem issue"".\n""The states parties agree not to advance the onus of finding a middle ground and to make it clear that our method of settlement is the direction the Palestinian and Israeli governments are heading,"" the statement said.\nTrump, Trump, Trump: We\'re open to negotiation. We have ideas. Trump, Trump: If you want the Palestinians to get the money and leave Israel, we\'ll talk about it,"" Netanyahu\'s press secretary, Sean Spicer, said following Trump\'s policy announcement.\nMixed results\nA week ago, Trump denied the progress made in the negotiations, saying: ""We\'ve been on slow-game, all indications of failure for what would have been years, so you probably agree with me.""\nNetanyahu, meanwhile, says the conflict created by Israel\'s annexation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and any area it had lived in for decades will be resolved.\nIsrael and its allies claim a Palestinian state under Islamic law is a final claim. It is the first time since the 1960s that the two sides have reached an agreement. Netanyahu has said only that an agreement made by Trump and Netanyahu included regional cooperation between Israel and the Palestinians.\nThe Jerusalem Post on Friday said Israel and the Palestinians reached a preliminary agreement on April 1 in the presence of a group of 100 top figures from Abbas\' Fatah, a militant group believed to be planning its own interim peace proposal for an Israeli-Palestinian state.\nPalestinians want East Jerusalem, occupied since an army offensive in 1967, to be an independent and unified capital.\nIn a stark rebuke to Trump\'s move, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said Trump was trying to shift American policy and destroy the budding ties between the two sides.\nThe Trump administration had accused Jordan and Israel, claiming that Abbas was meddling in Middle East peace negotiations with his offer of sanctuary from Washington to “colonialist” states like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\nWATCH: JERUSALEM AUSTERIA - Key statements on the U.S. plan to withdraw U.S. forces from Middle East: https://t.co/ddGixnEHF pic.twitter.com/en54XdwzAB — CNN (@CNN) April 3, 2017\nTrump\'s proposal would also cut Egypt’s peace agreement with Israel.

He has not implicated the Palestinian Authority in his attacks.\nAt the same time, Islamic militants have entered the civil service in Israel and the high-profile political opening of the Parliament\'s new campaign office — a vacancy that could draw the expected sharp rebuke from prominent Israel supporters and the Jewish state\'s right-wing hardline former prime minister Likud party.\nWith the vote, Netanyahu is relying on convincing majorities of voters to stop a right-wing incumbent — whose country\'s coalition has been split since December — and establish a six-month process to build a centrist government. The polls were scheduled to close on March 19.\nSo far, they have won most of the 537 seats in the House of Representatives, most of them uncontested. Only 18 seats in the other 50 are in question.\nHowever, the margin is still wide, and Netanyahu\'s lead over rivals could be reduced. Not only would some vulnerable centrist voters lose their seats — the Election Commission has taken the example of the anti-militant Hamas, which is running a multi-year campaign operation for parliamentary seats on the same day as the election.\n\'Taking the Arabs to court\'\nIf Netanyahu wins, it would be the first election to nominate a Jewish or Muslim man as prime minister since 1946. Netanyahu has launched a scathing attack on other liberal and pro-Israeli parties in the wake of his tough parliament performance in 2011.\nThe polls predict more extremist candidates like Meir Kahane, a hard-line former leader who is being investigated for embezzlement. He is set to be challenged by a conservative party\'s former chairman.\n""It (the election) will be a very interesting day in many ways. There are many many young, educated people who will decide how to vote,"" Likud legislator Demetrios Billings told CNN.\nJewish centrist parties are also experimenting with the prospect of ""grand coalition"" — which will see each candidate opposing the other — that could seem a final test.\nConservative Oslo-based Eldar Khalaf, who heads the ruling Torah Party, is leading Jewish candidates.\n""Any third-party candidate with the past or future of the Likud would have an opportunity to build a coalition and take advantage of Netanyahu\'s vast experience and his example,"" Khalaf told CNN.\nCan his party win a clear majority?\n""You don\'t rule out from making a certain commitment to ensure that Knesset Member Lapid moves forward with reform, but if you simply maintain the status quo that could make it impossible for Lapid to create a majority,"" Amos Gilad, a political science professor at Hebrew University, told CNN.\nNetanyahu himself was in the prime minister\'s orbit after his party took over Jerusalem in 2001, and has held the post since assuming office. His movement has posted strong numbers in several other towns and cities, and polling is expected to increase further.\nLabor\'s Isaac Herzog, a former Israeli military commander who is a possible contender, will appear as a challenger to Netanyahu.\nThe government\'s staff must hand over to the electoral commission the results of an election to be declared by the following day.\nMeanwhile, Hamas keeps pushing for elections.

But Katz has a relatively narrow lead over his nearly opposite-side counterpart Netanyahu, according to Zeev Elkin, a political scientist at Tel Aviv University.\nThe 65-year-old Katz built a loyal following for decades, counting National Identity, the nationalist party that holds most voter registration in Israel, which requires members to hold a citizenship test to vote in order to qualify.\nCritics are criticizing him for playing favorites with the parties he narrowly won in last year’s national elections, which largely represented left-wing and religious voters. Katz favors closer integration of the Palestinian West Bank, similar to previous regional plans that bypassed that region’s peace process with Israel.\nConservatives also complain of Katz’s personal involvement in politics.\n“Many Israelis feel that Netanyahu and his party are getting a bad deal,” said Gerrie Fonseka, a research fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute and an observer of Israel’s electoral system.\nDespite government objections, the polls show the formation of a Palestinian state with permanent peace negotiations as the only viable solution.\nIsrael captured Jerusalem from the Palestinians in a 1967 war.

Paulo Bento, for his endorsement,” Guulhui said. “I think these questions are very serious.”\nBeleaguered President Michel Temer said Sunday that he had suspended Michel Temer and made diplomatic visits to Trump earlier this week.

623,Once the Amazon rainforest passes the point of no return it could be gone in decades,"['The Amazon is a tiny stretch of watery land where more than 1 million migrants in 13 million years ago hid out and fought over countless parcels of land, many being in remote locations in search of food, shelter, and financial protection. But the Amazon has changed since then.\nDr. Seema Shreedhar, a microbiologist, and a geochemist, has dug up 2.4 million years of water logged in regions where the Amazon is moving its energy, carbon, and biodiversity at a rate of two meters per day. This physical variety is why microorganisms in the Amazon often need less fertilizer than in other places on Earth. The team has found that since the 1990s, ""biodiversity and climate are rapidly moving inland and feeding on chemical synthesis.""\nShreedhar, a study co-author, revealed the conclusions at the Dr. Peter L. Ganesan Institute of Marine Sciences in Texas. According to the WebMD news site, Shreedhar says these changes in land composition create a ""space"" of about 3 trillion square miles or, ""huge rivers of energy where a lot of the water runs down to the bottom.""\nWe have seen many rivers rise above their natural course to form bodies of water known as basins. These include Assiniboine, Icicle, Ovenland, and Brahmanal rivers that form a gateway to the Amazon. Shreedhar calculates that these rivers provide about an 85 percent of the energy of the Amazon.\nAs far as a direct comparison to the paucity of energy that the Amazon must bring in to achieve clean energy, that\'s a conversation between two civilizations. And that\'s a conversation that really hasn\'t happened yet.\nShreedhar explained that both civilizations have used different seeds, metals, and chemicals to reforest forests in the region. But as the Amazon wars subsided and left some regions with waterfalls, increased concentration of plants and animals was brought to bear. The species changes made by those changes have an impact. Already the Amazon, with more than 12 million hectares (or 15 million acres) of forests are in fact changing landscape, density, and habitat.\n']"

632,Source: Trump is concerned about coming into contact with people infected with coronavirus,"['Somebody heard Donald Trump speak this week about placing special tariffs on all types of vaccines. At least, that is what some scientists theorized during a confirmation hearing, noting the president’s promise about using a different government’s resources to improve vaccines.\nIt is possible President Trump made his controversial message from a cave in his congressional campaign more serious than it was. But even putting that aside, what prompted the more serious worry for his administration, his Twitter followers, may be whether he intends to apply the same level of anti-vaxxer safety as he did when he threw out the PR bomb of a year ago.\nAnd that concern has finally become infinitesimal.\nThe White House press corps had already been reluctant to opine on the president’s call for tariffs, except to link it to the terrible record he’s produced, which already inspires incessant follow-up questions, just as he has led the Republican Party’s worst backlash to his presidency.\nThen the fact he suddenly declared he wants to impose a 15% tariff on all vaccines and he could make health-care advocates question this or any administration’s practice of putting a price on health care. That’s the miracle cure for those who shrieked “Whooooooooo!” at the moment.\nWhen he was asked for evidence that the vaccines were safely performing, he did not mention the department. After all, the vaccine industry’s mega-billion-dollar revenue stream has been ferried out by government snooping. As Stephen Chait notes at Slate, this only makes the pronouncement more believable.\nApparently the White House believes that if it can get new levels of vaccinations to work then the trade penalties of one out of three-disease reduction program could be worthwhile.\nTrump had reportedly given a talk last week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is a growing group of Russian and South American leaders eager to stake their claim on an issue with a willing nuclear foe.\nWhat makes these allies even more alarming, though, is that the White House campaign promise was not one that Trump himself explicitly announced, simply a plan to “increase the amount of vaccines we sell in each market.”\nJust as importantly, the question was about the threshold for yet another round of tariffs. After all, President Trump had once touted that, once he made his decision, there would be a “larger global health market.” He claimed the Trump administration was not a country trying to be a trade war with China, but instead would increase the global, trade-based market as the Russian government mulls, or reconsiders, its own portfolio.\nAt some point this rubber ducks, as Trump comes up with a plan to increase the rate of vaccine rebates, but it is true that the rhetoric on those front will never test the president’s political will.\nThough it could go on for years, the best justification for Trump making his controversial claim is that his announcement could help spark a greater global trend away from the horrors inflicted by the Cold War and more on issues with serious consequences.\nIt’s all too easy to pontificate “Come, us, whatever, we’re for all kinds of vaccines.” It’s just “our” vaccine industry. Yet, more interesting than the exemption-seeking rhetoric and, well, the hypocrisy of making such a denunciation, Trump’s “good friend” Prakash Jha recently quipped, “I don’t care about the public sector.”\nIf that was the case, why is it so hard to interpret Trump’s “good friend” comments as more about remaining after all those years of #MAGA and Trump’s bad in the world?\n']"

The first group has four characters created according to their origin, and each will be represented as a different color.\nThe second group features four characters, one from each country, and at each one’s chosen state, one protagonist will be depicted. At each of the four states, actors will be required to paint the characters from one country.\n“We have a projected reflection on the scene so that it meets perfectly,” said Lardard. “The themes of change and progress all take place in the colors.”\nThe longer one is illustrated, the longer it goes. “The color scheme is designed to emphasize that that culture is alive and evolving, and that there will always be periods of human suffering and intolerance or violence in history,” said Lardard.\nThe “Color” pipeline comes in deep under the St. Antares dance ground in the works, something that Lardard feels is important to the organization and the city as a whole.\n“This story touches on a wide range of issues, including the difference between development and industrialization; the unique nature of our most recent memories; as good as the traditions of these cultural identities, we have so much more to learn about the context of different communities and cultures, and how such similarities can be translated to our everyday life.”\n']"
638,Uganda restricts travel from 16 countries including UK and US because of coronavirus,"['KAMPALA, Uganda — Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni restricted travel from 16 countries in the country to bring the coronavirus now so prevalent that it poses a serious threat to the country, he said on Tuesday.\nAvax, the virus that has killed thousands of people worldwide, has proven deadly in Africa, and Uganda has sent a giant warning to members of the public about the disease, urging them to avoid travel to its affected parts.\n“If we cannot get rid of the infection and treat it effectively, it has spread to other parts of the world, including Ghana, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Chepkalo and in Uganda,” Museveni told a news conference after the announcement.\nHe urged people to report the transmission of the disease to the government and that efforts must be intensified to prevent it from spreading.\nAvax, which is previously known as a coronavirus, is the most common strain in the West African sub-region that can spread easily from person to person.\nOne day after it killed 10 people at a new coronavirus centre in Uganda, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the deadliest example of the virus in West Africa to date.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said just a month ago that Avax was only recently out of being suspected of being the trigger for that outbreak, the deadliest virus detected since the 1970s.\nYemen took the most recent example of the outbreak, killing 39 people, largely among its youths.\nAir travel to the region is sometimes limited due to the lack of health workers, so fighting the virus has weakened travel by stopping temporary clinics from transporting patients and falling costs for surgery.\nThe police force known as the Museveni police, the Gweru Police and the Uganda Public Health Administration were on Tuesday barred from carrying out immunization, though they were able to carry out services that benefit people from the West African region.\nThe restrictions apply mainly to foreigners who had not been hit by Avax, the European Union’s infectious diseases coordinator for Western Hemisphere said in a statement, noting that only Sudan and Eritrea have been restricted to travel.\n“Because of the shortage of personnel and supplies, people have been not able to travel to the West African Region and the rest of the world.”\n“Avax has been discovered in the UK and the United States, making travel to the region virtually impossible,” the statement said.\n']"
639,Rare white giraffes killed by poachers at Kenyan wildlife sanctuary,"['WITH KILLERS AT RISK, visitors must carry their dogs inside of their car, not touch them, and sign in with ID, to pass an ID check.\nLike car fever, the deadly animal abuse crisis has magnified the public\'s outrage over one of the worst poaching attacks in recent Kenyan history.\nThe Mozambican government\'s assault on savannah elephants has led to weeks of fighting between major poaching groups — together with unprecedented numbers of poachers and their millions of black rhinos — pushing international boundaries to protect the continent\'s endangered animals.\nThis has raised the stakes for a new round of negotiations, beginning with Beijing, which pledged to help protect Great Shaloo, which, the world\'s largest black rhino, is in danger of disappearing on the brink of extinction.\n""The stakes are not high,"" Dora Chinda, a Malawian official visiting the Kibinyi Wildlife Sanctuary, told CNN. ""Tens of thousands of elephants here will be lost.""\nAfrica\'s elephants are the world\'s second-largest rhino. While they have always been poorly conserved and are on a steady decline, this means that gushing resources such as elephants\' breeding facilities can be secured.\nYet experts warn that if the poachers and the government don\'t act together, “the reserves of these amazing elephants are already at danger.”\nIn a quick analysis of the fatal poaching attacks, Africa\'s Institute for Conservation and Derivatives indicates the two groups are technically two sides of the same coin.\nWhen poaching occurs, the poachers do:\n* A female elephant, which has already been killed by rhino attack, will have accumulated 1,400 square miles (1,000 square km) of habitat, about 90 percent of which is untouched by humans.\n* A male bull elephant attacked with iron rods (a kind of explosive metal that can explode in a struggle for space) will have accumulated 745 square miles (1,000 square km) of habitat, about one-third of which is untouched by humans.\n* A female elephant attacked by a beef deer attacked with bamboo poles will have accumulated more than 4,000 square miles (up to 2,000 square km) of habitat, about half the terrain of other African elephants.\nIf the giraffe and other male elephants are still roaming out to sea (winds of 110 mph or higher), that means the National Transitional Council or NTC should seek protection for all of them, said the regional expert Mohamed Anani.\n""The government of Tanzania had an idea but this was a phenomenon it didn\'t understand how it would actually protect elephants,"" he said.\nBeyond the potential danger posed by elephant poaching to Great Shaloo — the country\'s most-populous park and just 120 kilometers (75 miles) from Kibinyi airport — is what experts fear most — the chance to catch poachers and the horns they often spray onto giraffes.\n""They use huge amounts of steroids to kill giraffes,"" said Rufus Mynmthakisema, a wildlife and conservation adviser at Kenya\'s National Parks and Wildlife Department. ""That kind of taking advantage of an animal will have a psychological effect. The result will be that there will be physical damage to the animals.""\nPoachers are also often propelled by anger — raising the cost of fighting the brutal campaigns of poachers that continue to permeate Africa today.\nIn Rwanda\'s Paul Kagame government, an aggressive poacher tries to shoot up to 100 animals a day, according to government figures, killing hundreds of thousands of animals.\nThe government has in the past tried to equip the country\'s elephants with cameras to be used as a hedge against poaching, but is failing to do so, according to Ruhu Humanitarian Action Network.\n“This is a country without elephants and they suffer from unplanned violence because of lack of research and insurance,” said Ruhu national environmental coordinator Mohammed Wainaye.\n']"

African countries have already dealt with the outbreak, he said.\n""There may be a number of deaths from the Ebola outbreaks, based on different models, other data related to the epidemiology of disease transmission,"" Carreras said in a phone interview from the Ebola capital of West Africa.\nThe Ebola virus, which the World Health Organization said originated in Guinea in 2014, was born in West Africa after an Ebola epidemic that sickened at least 5,000 people, sickened hundreds more, then spread to neighboring countries.\nYet, Carreras cautioned that ""most of these countries are not experiencing outbreaks. If the outbreak are strong enough for it to continue, and it continues, people may live longer and perhaps die more often than the diagnosis indicated.""\nMore than 120 cases have been reported so far in all of West Africa, but there have been around 250 deaths, said Dr. Indira Vamil, a public health consultant and African expert at WHO, at a news conference.

In a South Africa case, patients are located on the recommendation of a single healthcare official at a public hospital after not knowing the symptoms for more than a week.\nExperts also point out that new cases of Ebola in the United States, where infection rates remain low, are unlikely to infect consumers, while the number of potential West African cases per 100,000 people -- higher than that of Ebola in Guinea -- indicate Ebola is spread over two-thirds of the world\'s territories.\n""The good news about the West African Ebola outbreak is that it should prevent all developing countries from ever getting sick from their Ebola outbreaks,"" said Kent Charu, of the Scottish British Medical Association.\nHe said that although Ebola isn\'t as contagious as is most viruses, ""Lapelphone, may not be enough to lessen the risk of transmission to individuals and communities that were previously considered immune.""\nIn 2014, Ebola was the World Health Organization\'s first viral outbreak of Ebola. More than 20,000 people have been infected with the virus since then. It is spread through bodily fluids and orally via contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or contaminated products.\nIf symptoms are mild, such as fever, chills, loss of appetite, seizures or unexplained vomiting, then they may be spread by contaminated food or other bodily fluids.

""And when she asked her children to leave them with her, they said it was too difficult. So they moved her out of the house.\n""She started using prescription drugs for arthritis problems. She developed anxiety problems and depression. She was changing her diet. But the pain would not get out of control and she couldn\'t do anything without medication. Eventually, she became incapable of doing a run for six months, with no mobility in her right arm.""\nShe will now have a couple of surgeries ahead. One is what Middleton describes as a bone marrow transplant. She will also have to create a new, carefree life. She is angry about the unfortunate option of starting a pregnancy from the comfort of her home.\n""She gets involved with school sports and some cookery classes and water polo events, but her relationship with medical care is really strained, because her needs go beyond getting her legs back,"" Middleton said.

Three people died of their injuries in Wuhan, provincial health director Martin Mwirunga said.\nSaturday marks the anniversary of the independence of the nation from South Africa and a year since independence for the whites in 1974.\nThere are fears of contagion from the unrest in Wuhan.\n“Why would authorities in Wuhan evacuate people and dispense evacuation instructions to that region?” Mpofu told CNN by phone.\n“They are saying that they’ve heard an earthquake and that they’ve heard people from that area telling them to evacuate, to keep quiet.”\nPeople were reportedly asking rescuers, including white officials, to move them in order to boost evacuation chances, causing “collateral damage,” “a humanitarian disaster,” looting and “malicious intent on the people,” state media reported.\n“I understand that some of the casualties are black, but it’s hard to live with a situation like this,” Mpofu told CNN.\n“We’ve thought that you might have people who are willing to die, you can’t just tell them to evacuate. But we can’t continue saying all the games are over. The worst thing is if you hear an earthquake and the village collapses. It’s dangerous. We have to try to stop it.”\nYesterday, one person had to be rescued by the police, who said the two bodies were taken to the Urban divisional hospital in the capital. They were released Wednesday evening, officials said.\nPolice said in a statement posted on social media that search and rescue teams have been sent to Wuhan.\nIn response to their calls, the white government was silent.\n“Clearly, there is no administrative or social responsibility on the part of the occupying forces for the government to step up on our behalf to offer assistance,” President Jacob Zuma told members of the nation’s political and business community in an address on Wednesday.\n“We ask the black audience and investors here to ensure that the family gets what it deserves.”\nOn Thursday, the president said that the political system had failed to restore confidence in the region after last week’s violent protests.\n“No one deserves more than who lives under the rule of law … who not receive the day’s justice, nor receive adequate security for their family and friends,” Zuma said, quoted by the South African Broadcasting Corporation.\nSisi to take the reins in Egypt\nSisi will take over at least two months in which five people have been killed in the unrest, according to Egypt’s state news agency.\nSisi said in a televised interview late last week that he would step aside after the white police are dealt with, removing him from the presidency.\nAt the moment, Sisi, who just took the reins in Syria as president, is at the centre of a dispute between the ousted president, Mohamed Morsi, and security forces for crackdowns against a Muslim Brotherhood movement that was banned and now takes control of several Arab states.\nSisi, a self-described moderate Muslim who used to be a member of the opposition, has said he wants to end attacks on Muslim Brotherhood leaders and remove extremists from power.\nOver his lifetime, he had visited the cenotaph in Cairo, along with Egypt’s military chief of staff, Ali Abdel-Fatah, according to Egyptian media.\nTop Western diplomat Nikki Haley was working on a cabinet reshuffle as the crisis there continues.\n— CNN Washington Bureau Chief Phillip J.

654,"Caught between roadblocks, they were sitting ducks for Boko Haram massacre","['By Carl Burgdorfer, Sara Iizuka for CNN\nA Christian group that specializes in ties to Boko Haram has said soldiers in Niger are recording videos showing Boko Haram fighters looting homes, roads and churches.\nThe official statement from the group, which calls itself the NCAID, shows them bringing livestock to long distance stops and mowing down people and returning with no compensation. They did not specify why they were fighting.\nIt was the U.S.-based NCAID that first reported the report of the episode, and was given a more detailed description by the Nigerian government’s spokesperson at the time. It only later accepted that the footage may well be authentic.\n“We didn’t investigate before,” said Biyi Wangel, the group’s acting director of state operations in Nigeria. “Instead, we began to request for a video tracing the movements of the four soldiers to investigate incidents of looting, violence, military exchange fire and calumny.”\nIn the video, soldiers are seen firing at farmers’ fields and seeking refuge from the violent encounter, like a lot of peace-loving residents across the country.\nThe military on Thursday said it found evidence of the raid in Niger’s other north-western region, Nigeria’s commercial hub, Kano, which the Nigerian army has clamped down on in recent days. The military removed a man from his farm there, the army said.\nThe 19-year-old soldier from the Kano region, who asked not to be identified, is shown showing up in the truck carrying livestock.\nHe and four other soldiers are seen mowing over homes and businesses and shoving trash into roads, the military said.\nNone of the soldiers in the video come to attention to the combat after Boko Haram splintered after four years of war.\nThe group engaged in the “showdown” Tuesday on the roads of Lake Chad, Nigeria’s worst crisis since 1991, with a nearly 11,000 death toll, the U.N.’s worst conflict in decades.\n“Our soldiers heard Boko Haram’s cries of God before they spotted them,” the NCAID statement says. “They then crossed into the surrounding countryside.”\nMore than 10,000 people have been killed since Boko Haram launched its recent offensive in 2014.\n“The (Boko Haram) militants of northern Nigeria were defending their homes, and women and children slaughtered in the name of their religion,” the statement said.\n“Their Muslim husband was killed and his children killed because Boko Haram leader (Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau) had dumped away goat carcasses in the bush and killed two children.”\nBoko Haram had been emboldened by the president’s Jan. 29 call for Western-educated militants to move to East Africa to join its ranks.\nHeikki Gunadasa, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, said earlier this week that $32 million had been given to finance new humanitarian and food aid programs in Chad and Niger since May.\nNICOSIA, Cameroon (Reuters) — At least 12 members of Boko Haram’s African wing have been killed in attacks in Nigeria and Cameroon, the coalition of Nigerien-based insurgent groups said Thursday.\nGroups of the 19-year-old soldier from Kano-class aircraft fighter pilot said in their statement that they had evidence of their involvement in the raids, which include a joint raid with Nigeria’s army. The NCAID said the planes “did not take part in actual or suspected combat.”\nIt was not clear if the group is affiliated with Al-Qaeda or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. A military official in northern Nigeria said the men have been leaving the country as it sought to quell protests about tougher anti-Boko Haram measures.\nBoko Haram, which has killed more than 8,000 people since 2009, has been fighting an insurgency that has swept from the capital of Baga into cities around the Niger border. The men, some fighters and private contractors, have converged on the western Nigerian city of Maiduguri in recent weeks.\n']"
655,This South African pilot is on a mission to change the face of aviation in Africa,"['LAMBOURNE, SEOUL, April 5 (CNN) — The insectoid wing out of an Airbus A320 crashes early on Tuesday, injuring 59 people, including the pilot, Canadian authorities said.\nNo new information has emerged from the crash, said a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration.\nThe Airbus A320 was leading a commercial service flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town when the plane veered and hit a tree, resulting in the ejection of the pilot, authorities said.\nThe South African Air Line Pilots Association has estimated that two people died in the crash.\nThe crash is the latest tragedy for South Africa’s civil aviation, which was slammed by a wave of travel problems and an overhauled network of airport hubs just a year ago.\nAs many as six pilots were injured in the crash and five others are still missing.\n“If anyone would have taken to it more carefully it would have happened in less than a minute and there could have been fatalities,” said Lucile Ohmyer, the CEO of the Civil Aviation Authority of South Africa, the authority in charge of overseeing aviation in South Africa.\n“Our main concern is to make sure that the crash does not continue to be a tragedy, and that passengers and safety are being protected and that we take the best care of them.”\nAirbus said it was investigating the accident.\nThe Airbus A320 aircraft has been one of the most popular jets in South Africa — an aviation rarity — for many years and carries more than 2,000 passengers per flight, according to industry figures.\nSouth Africa is home to thousands of aircraft built in the past 15 years. They include Boeing 737-800s, Airbus A350s, Boeing CSeries planes and Boeing Cessna 208s and others.\nEach of the A320’s eight cogs suffer from loss of altitude when turning down altitude. That can lead to a collision with an engine attached to the aircraft. The pilot of the plane or another passenger died as a result of that ejection.\nSouth Africa’s civil aviation agency is among the most stringent in the world with high-tech standards aimed at ensuring flight safety.\nThe A320 had been refuelling, when it was destroyed in an airplane crash in the western Libyan city of Sirte on Monday, officials said.\nThe planemaker noted that none of the A320 crew survived the collision. However, it will test out the plane for flight safety tests and have the aircraft equipped to react to the difference between altitude and high flight.\n']"
656,This designer is creating fashion prints from maths equations,"['Remember last week that, for example, at once flat-screen TVs and portable QTVs, the TV screens of many people and computers were subtly curved into whirlpools and arms.\nAdmittedly, the friction of the curved screen and arm has always been unintentional, because cleverly, some people thought.\nAnyway, something called choruses or tweezers had been invented by Shanghai mathematician Yuhui Ein, marking what the internet might call ""the discovery of mathematics steps.""\nSo maybe it\'s not quite art, but we\'ll finally get to hear someone explain this to us -- which is, of course, by sharing this story of how her maths really started -- and the history behind its invention.\nAs with so many new toys, the choruses are designed to fit differently. Though it\'s claimed in the past that you\'ll be able to make like-minded people into the picture -- ""like"", ""like"", ""like"", ""like"", ""like"" - using these inspired forms, there\'s a certain psychological limits to how you can accomplish them.\nA resistor, or a television, could require more components, but would cost less to manufacture and your production would be less likely to overload your computer. A calculator might need help with deciding whether to be good for your pocket, or for your hardware.\nThe choruses were created to be fun to play with and were designed to be useful in mathematics research. ""Good mathematics isn\'t a hobby,"" Yuhui tells the Guardian. ""It\'s a passion."" She\'s happy to share with us how we tested and accomplished that question.\nWe\'ve asked her for more details about the hardware for which she has made some useful choices. The first is for a folding model of the carmaker. She suggested extending the car\'s life for a long time to allow for its possibility to replace conventional wheels.\nAnother suggestion for a new model might be for fans of displays to make way for even newer displays such as vending machines or sporting equipment.\nInstead of sending your children to school thinking you have to set an alarm each morning or wake up four hours before they get in the house, the choruses would be able to make use of the internet to alert people that you\'re running late.\nSo of course, as soon as you hit the road you\'d be in the better mood to answer your call.\nAs with the calculator, all the choruses are distributed on different sizes and, depending on which retailer you go to, you\'d be able to create a whole variety of models based on the learning a new code involved.\nFor each random contact, a joker would make repeated moves, or you\'d want to cut a quick Google-code spreadsheet in 30 seconds.\nNot only that, but players could simply lift large toys into mass-produced sizes.\nFor those people who probably don\'t know how a calculator works, consider the tiny size of a plasma TV. The analog entry in TV sets in ""video games"" that you buy for example is spaced a few inches apart, whereas in smartphones they cross the same separation.\nAnd when we look at the diagram, it\'s just one piece of wonderful technology: small screens. I\'ve used TV models in my spare time, but not on our standard commute.\nI, quite frankly, have no idea how to illustrate maths steps or even understand them.\nAs I wrote in an article last week about Yuhui\'s innovation, ""A study has put the process of constructing a choruses on the internet behind pure mathematics steps.""\nGiven the interest in maths equations it\'s safe to say you don\'t have to face the maths problems of your dreams.\n']"

Electricity accounted for almost half of the total energy consumed in the country in 2017, up from 54 percent at the beginning of 2016.\nA mid-term report issued last week on Senegal’s plan to reduce dependence on foreign aid said its own two-thirds of its population is now dependent on domestic energy supplies.\nThe country has already said it wants to boost its energy exports to more than $10 billion a year.\nBoosting energy security comes in the form of a new $1.5 billion development fund, which aims to bolster efforts to develop coal-fired power stations and help industries diversify into biomass.\nThis is one of its most important initiatives.\nThe Fund will go to expanding jobs and bolster the economy, Diaguade added.\n“Energy is the most basic investment for our modern economy and for the world we live in,” he said.\n""The key to innovation lies in technology and not just energy technology,” he added.\n']"
658,Expert view: Seven leading African photographers from across the continent,"['By Ted Chiang\nWhen I first met Batang, the breathtaking, stranger-than-fiction author from South Africa, I had an almost extraordinary view of him from the perspective of an engraver.\nBatang was born in Rotterdam in 1954 and grew up in Colleen, South Africa. He later moved to a rural village of Keetmanshoop in the Basque Country and eventually spent his time in southern Africa in rural Cambodia. He continues to attend an annual photography conference at a university in the Southwest African region, often visiting me there as he works on his book Living in Africa.\nA lot happened in his short time there. The country of his birth was world-famous for its early move from the cotton mines to its southern Africa capital, Cape Town. We were there trying to document the beloved golden boy of Ghana, Hippocrates. And after all this, he was so captivated by the entrepreneurial spirit of his early West African contacts that he began traveling to exotic places all over the world, setting up his own side-project, “The Coghong” at the tender age of 30, out of Amsterdam’s Park Rd, Amsterdam.\nHe was moved to New York by the mix of comfort, wellness and writing, so the second time he brought up the subject of his book he went to Dakar, Senegal, and he returned there by a second time to expose the desert landscape he had visited. That book was titled “Camped Out in the City,” and an advertising campaign for the book was soon produced.\nWith the help of colleagues and his dealer, Arthus Gurkuyana of Beeji National Institute, I was able to film his travels here and there, especially the colonial-era village where he and his cousins sold cigarettes and tried to fight famine.\nBatang studied photography in the United States and chose to become an amateur photographer. But his curiosity over photography was what prompted him to launch “The Coghong,” and it was despite the fact that his alma mater at Cornell University provided him with a course in photography there that led him to establish his own studio here in New York.\nAfter this period of exploring Africa, Batang brought home his treasures, as well as his photographer husband, Willie, and their nine children and many pets.\nTed Chiang is a visiting photographer who is based in South Africa.

664,This luxury ice cream is made from insects,"['Imagine you\'re an ice cream fanatic, need a boost of flavor while you sip on an ice cream sandwich, and are ready to just take some pre-prepared down, teething hot, and flavor the cream. These are your necessities: you\'ll want to be able to experience both the sweets and meltdowns, as well as the ice cream that might be coming along with it. And while you\'re here, there\'s something at the bottom of the ice cream case -- known as the moon. It might look impressive, but you have no choice but to lug it to the freezer -- and to the fire house (think double-shades).\nIt\'s hard to find these mummies, but you can spot them in places where you can walk away feeling totally undisturbed. One claim we\'ve seen used (and positively spotted), is the Tower of Babel ice cream. The portable, cube-shaped ice cream sandwich is a kind of symbol of volcanoes in the sky, at least for many people.\nEnlarge Image Frank D\'Alema/CNET\nThe symbol was conceived by Joe ""Rud"" Savage, an ice cream lover (and the inventor of the sculpture ""The Rainbow""), at a Manhattan hotel in New York. Savage was given the idea while taking a cleaning class and decided to come up with something altogether different -- surprising with its familiar tech: the moon. Savage figured out how to make a moon of ice in time to reflect on the treasure trove of secrets remaining behind the layers of ice.\nThe idea got resurrected when a closed room from a different room was spotted on the sidewalk. It likely went unnoticed until a camera caught the random wandering eyes of this strange little orb that\'s turned everything from a bed to a fridge into a working moon.\nCNET\nNot only is the moon ""What to Order"" the word of the night, but the moon\'s features allow this all to be unique to the ""moon,"" after all.

Chambadensis is similar to (10 tablespoons of) pomegranate, or Madagascar cinnamon tea,"" the CFB South Africa Planting Facility official told CNN last year.\nThe official even called the plant ""the first produce plant in South Africa built around a cheap, underground trench where the two species live in harmony,"" according to CNN.\n""The seeds and fruit have been grown, and there are believed to be seven workers working the plant,"" Burra said.\nIt\'s a bit of a feat, given the state of South Africa\'s latest agriculture program, according to the South African Ministry of Agriculture.\n""South Africa is one of only two countries in Africa not to have a $2 billion agriculture program,"" Ag Minister Jacob Zuma told CNN last year.\nHow much a handful of banana plants can produce in one day might be harder to grasp.\n""We don\'t think a handful of bananas can produce that kind of quantity.

While it was initially stated that John Brockway and Bradley had signed a three-year extension, the federation then determined that they would not be able to renew the contract, so Bradley opted to leave the USA\'s national team through the winter.\nHe said in an announcement released to the media on Friday that the decision ""reflects regret about the potential actions taken in 2016, and concerns the future of the international team.""\nBradley wrote that he was ""deeply remorseful"" over the decision, and detailed his previously ""total disdain for our environment,"" as well as his ""deep disappointment"" over the nature of the U.S. team\'s activities that he considered unsuccessful, which he described as ""highly improper,"" and the fact that he received threats and beatings.\nIn an internal letter on behalf of the organization, Trump praised Bradley, who had been working alongside his wife Michelle and three children for nearly two years when Bradley resigned last January, as a person who ""firmly believes in the values we have brought to this national team, including having representatives of our membership receive ethical and religious instruction.""\nThe US Soccer Federation president also explained that they needed to understand Bradley\'s background, and that he lacked a PhD in international law, so that his replacement could correct a major problem.\nA memo with Bradley\'s legal adviser said he said he was ""proud to have brought thousands of hours of work to the U.S. national team during an inauspicious tenure. I thank all of my friends and family for their support over the past year, and I will miss the game of soccer with all that makes it work.""\nHe told the USSP: ""I remain confident that U.S. Soccer will and must continue to make great strides to ensure a positive representation of the United States international team.""\nThroughout his tenure, Bradley discussed the situation with select U.S. Olympic team officials, media and the Olympic Committee, multiple other NBA stars and U.S. officials.

He spoke in private, apologized publicly for all the things he did wrong, and added that the former Bruins star wanted to bring a ""new day"" to the organization.\nHe also said he felt ""vindicated that the U.S. national team holds up the standards that we, as fans, expect from our team.""\nBradley would not disclose the name of the coach he was looking for in a prospective interview with reporters.\nHe had previously said he would still coach the national team after his contract was expiring, but a source, adding that the man that the organization had to choose was not directly related to his athletic coaching position.\n']"

668,Homeless Californians join in a lawsuit to mandate Los Angeles provide shelter for thousands,"['SAN JOSE, Calif. — National League of Cities leaders have teamed up with one of California’s worst and most homeless shelters to launch an effort to force the state to address the complaints of residents who receive food and other assistance during cold weather.\nThe fight to become one of California’s “worst” in recent memory follows a similar lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County last month, which served as a backdrop for a series of meetings Tuesday in San Jose aimed at raising public awareness and urging the Legislature to close the aging Los Angeles homeless shelters.\nThe groups of San Jose’s homeless program are the National League of Cities, a nonpartisan advocacy group dedicated to combating homelessness and climate change.\n“This partnership is the perfect opportunity to help Californians become successful recipients of the most basic public services,” Jon Leitner, president of the League, said in a statement.\nThe Los Angeles shelter business “has been the conduit through which homelessness and global warming have been established through devastating mountaintop stormwater runoff loss,” he said, calling the programs that have delivered protection, meals and thrift stores “both critical public health issues in and around our cities.”\nThe shelters house roughly 16,000 Californians without permanent housing in the state, according to the California National Guard.\nBecause Los Angeles is the county with the largest population, they typically house only the most severely traumatized.\n“Southern California’s homeless population of more than 7 million accounts for one-third of the state’s population of residents,” Riverside County Supervisor Mike Antonovich said at Tuesday’s meeting, referring to the state.\nThe National League’s president and chief executive, Stephen Leitner, called the marches on Tuesday “extremely innovative and uncoordinated” in his 22 years in business. He noted that the California Legislature has agreed to create a task force to consider solutions to address this “chronic issue of homelessness.”\nAntonovich, chair of the Assembly’s oversight panel, said the Legislature’s blueprint for government funding aimed at addressing homelessness and poverty “does not follow clear separation between institutional income and reduction. It follows not nearly as closely as the proposals enacted by California and by local governments, and it requires cities and counties to find billions in funding to provide services to the individuals and families they are supposed to be helping.”\nAntonovich said the city’s supplemental fiscal funding, under state law, generally comes from healthy sources, but the state has limited funding for housing and shelters, so he urged lawmakers to tackle changes to the state’s proposed No Child Left Behind law.\n“Unless we take action quickly to reduce the past two decades of the devastating effects of this educational achievement gap on our schools, it is clear to me that Assemblyman Leitner and the Legislature must increase the funding needed to adequately address this crisis.”\n']"

It arrived after Missouri schoolchildren who had encountered the infection on a school bus in August were diagnosed with secondary symptoms — nausea, dizziness, diarrhea and respiratory illness.\n“The initial symptoms started in the morning and escalated to something like this,” Michael Brown, Blue Weather’s vice president of public affairs, told CNN in a telephone interview. “We have actually been providing news updates to the people in our communities who have been touched.”\nBut Brown said the infection was low-risk, and an analysis done over the last month — looking at public websites and online forums — revealed that the system it was using was no longer in use.\n“We just found out that this is a serious virus that actually doesn’t discriminate,” Brown said. “We have mechanisms to make sure that we’re able to meet public expectations.”\nBut there are health-related problems with the test, Brown said.\nThe tests are too confusing for many sick people to use — “a totally confusing task,” Brown said.\n']"

675,These states have been hit the hardest by coronavirus. Here's what they're doing to fight the spread,"['It\'s the climate it seems, but there are heretofore no vaccines to combat coronavirus virus. Until recently.\nAfter a spike in HIV cases in 2016 that killed a WHO-accredited cancer specialist, researchers set up a partnership with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to focus on detecting and fighting the virus. And now, two states have been the victim of what the CDC called a record-breaking outbreak of coronavirus.\nIn a release Wednesday, CDC said the outbreak now threatens only 5,900 people from four states, and 1,753 more are infected since the outbreak started.\nPreventing coronavirus outbreaks\nThat\'s the ""worst outbreak ever,"" the CDC said. It has already claimed 300 lives so far, and so far this year it claims almost 170 people from 11 states including New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Nevada, New Mexico, Washington, and Minnesota.\nThe CDC estimates this outbreak could be the most serious coronavirus case recorded since 2003, when it shot down more than half a dozen infections across the United States and Canada. The outbreak affects 2.1 million people worldwide, up from 52,290 in 2013, when it caused 145 deaths and nearly 750,000 infections.\n""Coronavirus\'s deadly history is now inextricably linked to our lack of effective therapeutics for the prevention of people with viral and respiratory diseases and other illnesses,"" CDC Administrator Dr. Tom Frieden said in a statement.\nBut while older people are more likely to become infected, there\'s another major contribution they may do. It adds up to many people of low incomes, including one study has shown that elderly people have a 23% chance of having died from coronavirus, compared to those of the general population.\nThe CDC said this outbreak is the sixth in six years of high-risk outbreaks, with the fewest detected cases since the agency started the effort in 2002.\nUnder severe pressure\nAnd yet, people are still dying from infecting their pets or other personal pets. So where\'s the help?\nIn a statement, Dr. Scott Aylwin, CDC\'s chief scientific officer, called the current outbreak an ""unprecedented"" situation.\n""When we look at a vaccine, we think we know how to keep that person alive,"" Aylwin said. ""And when we evaluate how effective we do that, we see that we need the right vaccines and what\'s best for our patients.""\nThat, Aylwin said, includes an effective vaccine against major viruses. Last year, WHO and the CDC partnered on a vaccine that blocked two major deadly viruses: the H7N9 flu virus and the JRS pandemic flu strain. But only 43 of the vaccines can stop the virus from attacking human beings and that hasn\'t stopped the most deadly.\nThat deficiency is what puts the disease at risk.\nSecond-hand blood exposure can cause severe bleeding and be fatal if untreated. And in rare cases, the virus even passes through your liver. Symptoms can include rashes, fever, fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea, and even bleeding red blood cells. For people living alone, death is the number one killer. For older people, it is the second-most deadly, Aylwin said.\nThe CDC said it will offer an emergency help line at 800-901-8305, through the agency\'s National Center for Transplantation, or NCTA. A can also call 211 if they are eligible to receive a new type of heart or lung transplant.\n""We\'re now seeing a whole range of potential preventable outcomes, and we need to understand which they are,"" Aylwin said.\n']"
676,How US spy agencies are tracking the coronavirus pandemic,"['With one infectious disease killing 2,300 people a year in 20 countries, it’s easy to forget about the 11 remaining pandemics. A September 2015 CDC study found that only 4% of the world’s outbreak victims had been vaccinated, but 28% of those who did get vaccinated never got sick from it.\nThe Copenhagen Institute for Infectious Diseases and Prevention of the U.N. Environment Committee notes, “The climate emergency that is climate change has reached peak effects of the pandemic. The full-blown human-poisoned pandemic could spread to the entire world in its wake.”\nA key question posed to the 2014 Americans with Disabilities Act is: How do we prevent pandemics from happening to humans?\nWell, one step can be taken at the risk of human-poisoned humans getting sick: To educate families about the potentially disastrous consequences of a widespread pandemic.\nFor example, children between the ages of 6 to 13 are particularly susceptible to all the viruses that might make their way into a world pandemic. For this reason, World Health Organization representatives are developing a vaccine.\nThis vaccination program can also be used in developing health care systems to help fight the spread of pandemics through immunization campaigns.\nIn the six states that have mandated the vaccine for use, it’s estimated at around $900 million, or roughly 20% of the total anti-pandemic cancer vaccine budget for each year until 2029.\n“Global vaccination rates are falling, and social support has often come at the expense of early and serious disease development,” says Dr. Danilio Davidi, chair of the WHO Global Vaccine Program in the Global Immunization Study.\nThrough the “adaptive insurance program,” U.S. children could buy immunization kits that provide the vaccines to themselves and their children of their own choosing. All immunizations in this plan have to be affordable and effective in order to qualify for the free vaccine program. This affordable insurance program and additional funding are needed now more than ever.\n“The vaccine supply is still dwindling and there will not be enough vaccines for every outbreak of pneumonia,” Davidi says. “It takes money from other government agencies and huge donors to purchase vaccines for every outbreak.”\nSo how do we encourage immunization?\nWith the current U.S. effort to eradicate polio, this means policymakers need to put their best foot forward to help a few million citizens who are suffering from polio in areas where they were previously protected.\nThe health people in these countries need to be vaccinated against an earlier, possibly more imminent pandemic than the ones we previously protected.\nThis means immunizing young people who may have suffered childhood polio, or even those at a high risk, by preventing them from getting sick, and encouraging their children to be vaccinated.\nAnti-pandemic vaccine programs are already popular in countries where there is strong public vaccination, particularly those with polio as well as care and education programs.\nMany countries around the world offer vaccine coverage to children at lower and higher rates than the USA, so this system will help make sure children are vaccinated if they’re exposed to anti-pandemic infectious diseases.\nThis may sound overwhelming, but the fight against global pandemics will take a long time, and no one should hesitate to vaccinate their children.\nDr. Daniel Meacham is senior manager for global public health at the World Health Organization.\n']"

(Extremists) are bringing this virus to our communities. We still have some unknowns, but it\'s going to take us a long time to get through the edges of human history. And that time will come someday.”\nSo far, no deaths have been reported to date.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention isn\'t saying the outbreak is slowing down, or that it was found to have started in April 2018. Norovirus or other airborne viruses can kill before symptoms develop.\n___\nThe first outbreak of this type of illness in May 2006 in New York was traced to a gecko species called Cockpit.\nThe CDC said Thursday that early in the outbreak, crews of gutter workers working on a sewer line were alerted to a gecko tent infestation, and workers and residents found no confirmed cases.\nThe virus causes symptoms typically seen later in life and can infect anyone with a weakened immune system, and can travel through the body\'s blood stream and can cause flu-like symptoms that last for weeks.\nThe CDC urges all people to fully avoid contact with people infected with the virus, including those who may not have stopped coughing, sneezing, or urinating. Passengers and travelers should avoid touching animals exposed to the virus.\nThe summer slumber party around Memorial Day was to be part of long-term Labor Day celebrations in Washington, DC.\n___\nCNN\'s Olga Grigoryants contributed to this report.\n']"
678,Congressional staffer tests positive for coronavirus,"['× Congressional staffer tests positive for coronavirus\nWASHINGTON (CNN) — Federal health officials have confirmed that a congressional staffer tested positive for the coronavirus, which has already been identified in Maryland and Virginia.\n“This is a great news story in the United States of America,” said CDC Director Dr. Scott Gottlieb. “This tragic incident is a very important cause of concern for patients and their families.”\nHealth officials said that one of the two patients had a second case, including three other children.\nThe other death occurred on April 4 when the White House visitor cardiologist noted there was “a relative humidity in Maryland today,” the CDC said.\nCDC said the concierge at the White House was taking part in a mammogram being administered to the woman. She reported first feeling ill on April 6 but had to cancel the appointment. The health department referred her to the CDC’s Women’s Health and Hospitals Vaccine Initiative in August.\n“Given the heightened risk, this woman was so ill she chose to avoid this screening. If the nurse refused to do her mammogram, this two-month-old child would not have been screened,” CDC Director Gottlieb said.\nThe disease, which can cause influenza, pneumonia and severe illness, is most common among older adults who are at higher risk of developing the virus, the CDC said. The CDC estimates about 65 million Americans, mostly women, will be infected.\nEven though “a popular vaccine” is effective against many strains of the virus, there are still risks.\nSymptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, runny or wet eyes, runny nose, sore throat, some weight loss, and diarrhea. The virus can spread in very small droplets or up to three times as quickly as other viruses, and there can be extreme cold or flu symptoms.\nThe virus can spread through droplets, which include ones made up of water, air, and saliva.\nThere have been only two confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States since 2016.\nThe CDC said one of the cases originated from Maryland. The second case came from Virginia, the agency said.\nThe two patients were studying students at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The woman was pregnant and was taking part in a girls’ physical activity class at the hospital.\nGov. Larry Hogan and the chief executive of the state’s school district said on Twitter that the man is her husband, a former track and field coach.\n“I can’t make it but personally, I would like to know if this is a case of the coronavirus from your state, or the country. We’re in mourning,” Hogan said.\nThe flu season also remains in full swing. The CDC said there have been 101 confirmed flu-related deaths in the United States this season, up 13 from last year.\nThe department said it could be a year for milder flu activity in the United States. But it warned that possible infections would also be available for younger children who may struggle to get adequate immunizations.\nCNN’s Evan Perez contributed to this report.\n']"

It showed both Democratic and Republican party picks as the winning team in the states of Arkansas, Nebraska, Kansas, Louisiana, Iowa, Missouri, Nevada, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Vermont, Mississippi, Vermont, Maryland, Delaware, Rhode Island, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Mississippi, and Wisconsin.\nThe Sanders campaign’s memo also argued that Sanders’ Sanders 2020 campaign saw its case win all five states in February.\nSanders said in January that his campaign’s victory might have been based on the results of the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary.\nBut last week, Nunes, Trump’s campaign manager, released a statement claiming in 2017 that Sanders Sanders defeated nine Democrats who crossed party lines.\nThe DNC memo confirms that situation, during a second of conversations with NRIC over the Jan. 24 “Resume Your Campaign!” the RNC memo adds.\n“We are very confident that Bernie Sanders will win Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina and have captured the campaign of the Nevada Democratic Party in June,” said Priebus.\n“It is equally important for the delegates of our party to understand that all of these states are considered ‘places of rest’ for the national Democratic Party. In New Hampshire, independent voters and self-declared national democrats are contesting the party’s nomination.”\nBut many Democratic Party leaders and interest groups argue that Sanders’ candidates would not achieve the close state endorsements needed for victory, and that Sanders would be taken seriously if the Sanders campaign’s “Resume Your Campaign!” template fails to protect his supporters from suffering from “self-inflicted wounds.”\n']"

I took him, and carried him to rallies all around the country in the midst of World War II and the war on terror,"" Rosenbloom said.\nEven those who didn\'t know someone loved the veteran.\n""Once he passed away, everybody lost their father.

A spokesperson from the Sandinista government in Nicaragua said that roughly 150 people were present at the ceremony, some toting pictures of the dead soldier\'s image and keeping the remembrance alive for the bereaved family members.\n""None of us knew how this was going to end,"" said Edwin Vuosa, a historian from Nicaragua. ""It\'s been a great honor. It\'s been difficult. I feel that people have a really good memory of him.""\nIt\'s still up in the air whether the memorial service will even take place.

Then she met and fell in love with Toby.\nAs they headed to college, Toby was still in karate when Jacqueline recognized him.\n“I heard he was great,” she said. “He had this amazing head of an oleaginous brain that was a perfect coach for him.”\nBut Toby was cancerous.\n“That was when I knew that it was going to be a long, long journey and my organs would need to be put to use,” Jacqueline said.\nOn her first day of high school, Toby called his mother, who spoke quickly and softly. “You help your mom,” she said.\n“Every day is tough. She’s f—-ing amazing,” Toby said with a smile.\nDoctors at Penn State University said the cancer had spread to his kidneys, but he was safe enough to talk about it.\nHe was diagnosed in 2013 with a rare form of lymphoma, leaving him in pain with shingles and a lacerated kidney, according to staff at Shorey, a high school in Pennsylvania that is involved in a program called Zero Tolerance for Cancer.\nDozens of other people also have gone to Penn State to help with Toby’s needs. His family has donated a kidney to a local water company.\n“This has been a very comfortable situation and our name is Hashy Dr.,” Jacqueline said.\nToby recently received a gold t-shirt, like a teammate from Pokolbin Club, a fraternity that does pledging for boys.\nJacqueline had no idea where to turn for support for her daughter. After dealing with him for a time she had actually considered dropping her son off at school to pay tuition.\nShe’s still undecided on whether she will keep Toby in her arms. He barely shows his face, giving up all the normal attention.\n“I think it would be a good thing,” she said. “I don’t think he’s a good neighbor, but if someone gives him an opportunity to use his gift for someone else, he’ll enjoy it.”\nJacqueline and her son will be one of nearly 10,000 students across the nation receiving kidneys.\nThe residents of other cities who participate, Delaware and Baltimore are battling lobelosus, or an immune system cancer — and none of their local recipients has received a kidney.\nDoctors at Valley Medical Center treat patients with low, localized lymphomas, which have left their kidneys unable to provide the fluid that allows the body to repair damaged organs.\nThe operation costs $45,000, and insurance doesn’t cover it, so the procedure costs are funded by GoFundMe.\n“It’s shown me a number of signs,” she said. “Her face is black, her arms are slimmer. The worms are floating in and out of the kidney.”\nAnd if Toby does survive, he can enjoy spending time with the other kids.\n“I’m the great grandma. Everything I do I do for Toby.

682,Farmington biotech teams with Yale to pursue COVID-19 vaccine,"['CYPRESS, Conn. (CNN) — Scientists at Yale University have found a strain of bacteria resistant to the synthetic version of a cancer drug that’s intended to fight human cancer.\nIn the study, exposed rats genetically engineered to be resistant to synthetic, drug-resistant versions of the drug Aerocotin developed under a $1.5 billion investment from General Electric.\nThe rodents were kept in the same room and eating the same food. The test results from the first test were published last year.\nThe synthetic version of Aerocotin is intended to treat rare cancers such as Leber’s C and H, which have a spreading effect of up to three to five years on the brain and bone marrow.\nLast year, the drug tested negative for the cancer drug in 29 of more than 3,200 samples tested by Yale and for one subset in its initial trial with patients with tumors inside the heart.\nProstate cancer in humans is the second most common type of cancer after breast cancer, according to the American Cancer Society.\nIt’s not clear yet if the Yale rats were bred to be controlled by the synthetic version of Aerocotin, but their evolutionary descent into the “fanoads” of the drug suggests the bacteria may be able to adapt for other types of cancer, said Dr. William DeLue, the university’s lead study author and director of genomics research.\nStill, he said, “these are exciting times” in the future of human health.\nIn its final trial, Synthetic Aerocotin was involved in 343 patients taking 12 to 27 tumors with a genetic mutation in green fluorescent protein markers. It was seen in 17 patients in the first phase of the trial.\n“After 24 years, in our little lab, they really have learned to consume the same more potent tumor toxin as the other group, which we don’t think is likely,” said DeLue.\nResearchers see common, biological traits of the Aerocotin bug as a strong double-edged sword in a small number of high-risk patients, he said.\n“They couldn’t be tested against the kinds of aggressive diseases we are seeing in the major categories,” he said.\nIn the synthetic version of Aerocotin that’s in the first phase of its clinical trial, tumours appear to be slowing down after only two months, the chemical firm Karolinska Institutet first reported on its development in 2012.\nAn analysis of information from the Yale and Human Genome Research Institute confirmed the rhinovirus, which isn’t on the synthetic version of Aerocotin, wasn’t directly connected to the Ribio-based Sybase drug, which has been on the market for roughly 11 years, it said.\nYet, because the sybase drug is not active yet, researchers also received from the antibody products that they’ve been waiting for.\nJ. Pyrris Joyce, a geochemist at Yale’s Reproductive Cancer Institute, said he believes the wilder version of Aerocotin could be the real deal.\nHe said the application of such drugs in non-human primates is challenging, but that it appears to work.\nBy Sheila D, for CNN\n']"

687,Local animal shelter offers unique adoption program for terminally ill pets,"['A little space makes life easier, but a veterinarian can sometimes just be scary\nMaybe it’s the horror of animal cruelty, but life is different for terminally ill pets whose owners are blind, frightened, or very morbid.\nAnimal Rescue Centers in North Carolina offer a unique program for terminally ill pets who want to remain together.\nThere is no money involved, and adoption is offered free of charge.\nEven the best wishes are worse than death.\nEveryone is welcome to adopt a dog or cat through these programs.\n3-Shenanz has 50 pets, each with different strengths and weaknesses from anyone. Their parents plan to help care for them, too.\nThree dogs (less than 20 at present) have just been selected for adoption and will be placed in foster homes.\nThe puppies will be adopted immediately before euthanasia, and will arrive as pets for the year.\nJust don’t think there’s a magic bullet to all of their ailments, because that’s impossible.\nThese program allows residents to identify their pets, and thus fill out paperwork regarding their identification.\n“I do believe that from time to time, we can find adoptable pets that are too sick to be maintained, that could be euthanized, that are not to be completely restored to a pet’s life; and that may have problems staying together,” says Peter\nCourtney, Animal Rescue Center development director and head veterinarian for the City of Raleigh.\nThe Cumberland County Animal Shelter was also able to take in an exceptionally sick Pet, thus creating a truly “immense” shelter to house pets with physical and mental disabilities.\nThis saves the animal from bad behavior, well-being and forever-lasting relationships with their owners.\nAs a partner with the City of Raleigh, Animal Rescue Centers hopes that the program will be a tremendous help to those having emotional, health and/or animal health issues in general.\n“We want to make sure that the pet is safe, humane and happy to be adopted by the other partner who will be caring for them. People might think that something goes wrong after someone dies; in fact, even animal cruelty does not necessarily guarantee a dog or cat will have a complete life because it’s difficult to find an owner who can take care of them,” states Courtney.\nUnlike some nonprofits, a doctor is involved in a “survival tour” for people with terminal illnesses, including those who have become pets.\nCustomers fill out paperwork including documents for the adoption, including vet bills and paperwork for the family pet.\n']"

Upon arrival, officers were told to find several people in the residence.\nPolice said officers located one victim in the hallway and found two people standing on the front steps, wearing short-sleeved shirts, jeans and black t-shirts.\nOne of the victims, a 16-year-old male, was bleeding from the chest and bleeding from the hand, Baltimore police said. He was taken to Howard Medical Center, police said.\nPolice said the suspects asked the victim if he wanted to leave, but he refused.\nThe suspects, two of whom are juveniles, entered the residence and removed a knife from the victim, police said.\nOfficers found the 17-year-old male who was stabbed. He had a gunshot wound to the head. His friend was taken to a local hospital to be treated for shock.\nOfficials released surveillance video from the nearby home, which shows the fight and appears to be likely a fight between a group of juveniles.\nTwo people were arrested, Baltimore police said. One is male, the other is female.

689,"After Fraudsters Racked Up $6,000 On Stolen Credit Card, HSBC Demanded Victim Pay Up, Despite âZero Liabilityâ Promise","['A Queens-based bank fraudster filed a whopping $6,000 complaint against top HSBC and two others on Friday, claiming the auditors made unlawful fraudulent withdrawals from consumer bank accounts and re-upped the charge against one of the individuals after they paid back fraud charges totaling $11,508.\nThe claims were forwarded to prosecutors on Friday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s New York office announced on Monday. The swindlers are accused of scamming 13 New York banks, three of which are headquartered in New York City. One alleged victim, a former HSBC employee, recently filed the complaint with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) under a false pretense of “no liability.”\nThe fraudsters were indicted on charges of using taxpayer funds and failing to register as a bank fraudster, the indictment states. Since Oct. 1, 2016, the fraudsters allegedly used their transfer funds to defraud residents in Queens of millions of dollars, the FinCEN said.\nThey were allowed to defraud these New York customers through fraudulently receiving credit and debit card payments in return for travel-related perks or use of personal merchandise, the indictment states.\nThe problem with these fraudulent transactions, the indictment states, was that “defendants could use the hidden deposit account at the banks’ branches to further their nefarious business activities.”\nIn the 24 weeks prior to the fraud, the records and other documents provided by the bank fraudsters continued to exist, according to the indictment.\n“(The defendants) threatened the victim with severe emotional distress and enhanced fear, (if) they (over) the years dismissed their fraud claims,” the indictment states.\nUltimately, the suspects took their victim down a list of 31 such identities, the indictment states. They then obtained fraudulent transactions from the victims and gradually re-upped the charge against one individual.\n“Further actions were taken by the defendants to garnish the victim’s wages, and to attach collateral collateral for loans secured by the suspects’ newly acquired HSBC accounts,” the indictment states.\nThe banks did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.\nThe fraudsters named in the latest complaint, admitted to filing a false pretense complaint from March 17 to April 5, while in March they appealed a denial of their final pretense claim.\n“The defendant bank fraud scheme was … devised through the belief that the only other victims of fraud are banks and the accused fraudsters were HSBC employees,” the indictment states.\nIn December 2017, HSBC and Nassau Provincial Police jointly investigated the fraud. The case was part of the investigation dubbed NCOOC 2012.\nWhile the three have been convicted in the latest fraud complaint, this no longer is as bad as it first thought.\n']"

Shortly thereafter, those other talents took off. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin had just been elected GOP governor, replacing Alix. Alix, the teenager whose temperament and awed nature inspired Palin and Palin in the first place, was a supporter of civil rights and interest groups and a champion of activist causes.\nOn Oct. 5, 2011, Alix opened up a small cable-access service called NFL Xpress on LinkedIn for an elaborate game of cat and mouse, complete with routine performance by the ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch jubon de nir na Iberia?\nNow, you might have heard from your publicist of Alix, via a phone message over the weekend, that the inspiration for the wild October, 2012 episode in World War II has apparently inspired a bunch of famous athletes to team up for one of the most famous games of the summer so far: the Russian Roulette-style game of ""playin\' like a bear and runin\' like a rooster,"" in which snow ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch as players send a hailstorm of players to create a circle of white ash and a snap of white marshmallow and the only way to get all 20 players in one circle is to cross a dumbaway and all the ch ch ch ch ch ch ch jubon de nir na Iberia?\nAlix is still bitter about it, and her lawyers are asking to seize the winnings as compensation for what she says was an excessive and inhumane punishment.

A woman who witnessed the crime was among those who said they feared for their lives when Rix was hired to kill them, prosecutors say.\nBut the court found Rix should have been held criminally responsible for himself and the others.\n“The court finds that the officials of the [San Francisco Department of Corrections] policy forbade Rix from using the [Ryan] Carroll gun at the time of the murders,” the judges wrote.\nThe court said Rix could not be held criminally responsible for Smith’s death in the murders that occurred just days before Christmas 2016, citing another factor. “The misconduct of Smith and his aide continued when Smith proposed getting sheriff’s deputies and police to shoot him during his interview,” Snow wrote.\nAccording to a statement made to the San Francisco Chronicle and obtained by CNN affiliate KTXL, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Bay Area Sheriff’s Department says the office cannot comment because the judicial process is confidential.\n“Given that homicide investigations can be notoriously lengthy, these tend to lack common legal principles,” Snow said.\nIn 2016, Utah deputy sheriffs called for Riverside County, where Rix was convicted, to reinstate bond.\nRix had his bail set at $50,000.

But Ramsey is a mother of two young daughters in the San Francisco suburb of Daly City, California.\nShe asked about plastic surgery, how she finds time to look her best, how much exercise her kids are getting at school, and her business plans for the years ahead.\nWhen it came to doing their business, Ramsey, who was a stylist and makeup artist before giving back to her circle of roots for nearly 20 years, knows people look at the masks and jump at the chance to help them not feel obligated.\n“They say, ‘You do it better than me,’ ” Ramsey said. “For me to do something to bring attention to something that I’ve felt up until now is so important.”\nRamsey, 53, in the foothills of the San Francisco Bay, believes success lies in combining her core values of “going about your business the right way” with her values of helping people succeed.\nShe’s a certified cake cook and pastry chef who took her children to Savannah College of Art and Design in New York City. She’s a former dance teacher and chairman of the Electrical Engineering Engineering Faculty Association. She’s an avid writer, and owner of Los Angeles-based Makito Cosmetics.\nRamsey says her power with clients stems from her personal history, and she sees a deep connection to the women’s movement that makes her feel connected to them and to those around her.\nLike everyone in the San Francisco region, the minority of women who participate in business equity lawsuits now are represented by the 10 Asian-American women who said they suffered huge economic losses after suing after falling for just the wrong suit.\nRamsey says her company in which she runs the Kaki Tumpeks plus Beauty City project also brings attention to healthcare issues related to women’s attitudes toward women.\n“We believe women in this country should be judged more fairly based on their looks and grooming needs,” Ramsey said. “We believe that being educated on beauty, wellness and wellness is life-changer.”\nThe story of the woman who lost her voice to cancer in 2012, for which she became famous, can’t be told without listening, and when the story goes to print, she wants to know what she did before launching her business.\nRamsey felt health was a priority in her last year at school. Her kids stayed away from her for periods while she underwent surgery to treat stage IV breast cancer in 2013. Her 2014 procedure was the subject of an impassioned debate between her and her husband about whether he would be best person to make her money.\nRamsey found herself having to confront the idea she wasn’t likely to be able to afford another procedure if she went forward, and the reality she faced when she landed a job in the Great City Jobs website as a fashion designer at Harper’s Bazaar.\n“It’s hard for me to believe something I know about now that they’ve seen and heard,” she said. “This is my life.”\nRamsey was able to work with the charity Smashbox to raise funds for the Skin Institute, a nonprofit that helps women overcome the effects of severe body dysmorphia and plastic surgery while working toward becoming successful women.\nWhile she does not think there is any way she can break the glass ceiling at Smashbox to pay it forward, the idea of a business in which people have collective voices made it onto the scene, such as when yoga promoter, Metrot in Calabasas, decided to run her own business, has made her believe the post office is bigger than them.\n']"

On November 18, 2016, it was given to Michael Johnson, a student at Brown-Roberts Elementary School, with a prescription for an “intoxicating high.”\nJohnson found his nose and mouth “unresponsive,” and snorted the drug, according to the federal court document.\nThe school declined to discuss the issue with media, citing a pending lawsuit. A Brown-Roberts School District representative said the drug was passed on to students as a protective measure.\n“School employees are required to report any suspicious items and we are working with our law enforcement partners to find these sources,” the district spokesman said in a statement.\nThe school is one of 10 in the nation in which the drug has been referred to as a Schedule I controlled substance because it is a Schedule II controlled substance.\n']"

704,Littleton school uses heart monitors to help students manage emotions,"['My friend Madeline visits with a student who has had a hard time focusing after hearing somebody else speak. Now she asks kids, “What’s your worry level?” is to say hello, then I look for the one for whom silence is a purpose. But I wonder if that is also a perspective to watch; how much time they are most likely to be sitting around these little blue screens looking at their peers.\nI want to have girls watch that for a long time. When I am looking for girls, I am interested in the kids. In our industry, the tendency to see girls only as passive characters, as we look at why we look so wildly different, is one of the biggest traits of the internet. Being a part of this movement is all about profit in general. Girls find themselves vulnerable if they can’t figure out where others are, that not all things of beauty are created equal. So, when a girl needs the attention of a group of beautiful young men, she’s always the first to intervene. Or maybe it’s just that the girls and it’s not pretty girls do to a regular girl?\nRecently, a group of boys wanted to kill a girl for having a dark past. But a school community came together to support the girl. And the school promptly began flying a high school flag, telling the boys to call someone. Sometimes the boys got belligerent, at others nasty, and finally decided to join the mission. The message was, “Love the girl and not the men,” just don’t talk back. The girls stayed in denial, holding back for what seemed like miles. Or perhaps the boys loved to create conflict. Who knew a good conversation would look like fighting? Who knew the tough guys would equally hate to take someone’s baby?\nIf you watch TV, you learn that it’s difficult to resist any kind of man for not talking back, but for having someone in a position of influence. And if you are, then you can’t resist the guy. This means that they will engage in a pit-stop for someone with to talk back. If they don’t talk back, the pace picks up and they will lose the battle and go back to one another. What are their options, let alone the desires of being violent? If one of them doesn’t want to be attracted to other men, that’s the choice they make. And the guy may start small, knowing the risks, or the bully may make small moves but there is nothing else.\nHere’s what is in line with the goal: Let these kids see themselves in the mirror. They’ll be able to see that they are having a real and bright future; that they are happy to be a part of one of the world’s most beautiful and diverse people. When they are, they will see their own self. They will see what their own needs are – being young, being smart, doing what they want. When someone doesn’t get out there enough, what do they do?\nWhich I am hoping will strike me as straight wrong, right away. I have a PhD in English literature, and a high-school level in college. I’ve looked at the books for the better part of two decades. I have found little boys turning to PDA when they can’t outgrow the privilege of being outside the house. I have found them constantly turning on the lights, when it’s not nighttime, at the sidewalk and in the open air, the place where they’ll get completely naked. I have also found that teaching these boys when they’re out in the open is how they grow into everyday boys. I can’t wait to hear what these boys think about this.\nIf I heard this personally and loved it the next time I read something, I would be willing to toss out a bunch of cool hats and shoes and put them on. But I don’t need the hats because I don’t need that much information. At least I don’t need the shoes because I have eyesight, which only a girl with an eye for eyesight would have. If I have a question or a video that I need from a girl I will learn to ask the questions immediately and I’ll see if they still want to play with her. If that’s the time, then be a part of the discussion.\nThe trolling\nI would rather ignore trolling than to get upset with what we read on the internet. But what may be most interesting is just how much it can influence the lives']"

Derecki, a doctoral student at East Central University in Houston, Texas, told CNN affiliate KTVK she didn’t plan to leave the apartment to go with her boyfriend.\nCastro was arrested at around 1:45 p.m. Tuesday, hours after authorities began reporting on cocaine use in the home, KTVK reported.\nAt least one of the four adults inside the apartment in West Covina failed to report the child, the warrant shows.\n“With the lack of access to their own apartments, we didn’t know how you could stay home with the medication if you could do so. You just thought you were going to be left alone,” police said.\nOne 911 caller reported that the child was around 1,000 pounds.

Police were awaiting background checks on the vehicle.\nThe operator of the car told officers that Castro told him there was “an uptick” in people with criminal records because he shared methamphetamine with other juveniles in the car, KTVK reported.\nIn another message posted on Facebook, Castro allegedly said to someone “I went and did some work for a family friend to help them get money off of the rent and get clean.” He said his girlfriend, who is 16 years old, was also among the callers.\nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals recently upheld an arrest warrant for Castro, saying he, allegedly with his girlfriend, played with methamphetamine and cocaine at homes in Green Valley, Livermore and East Orange.\n“The physician essentially concluded that cocaine use was not inconsequential in the courts, given the overwhelming evidence that cocaine use is treated at high levels in the medical community,” Judge Kathleen Shanahan wrote for the court, KTVK reported.\nTwo others, police said, are being interviewed.\nThe woman in the car, a man and a woman on parole, was not in the vehicle.\nLast July, KTVK reported that police were sent to the home where Derecki’s mother lives after the girl was reported to be having seizures.\nDerecki lived in the apartment.\nPolice who searched the home on Tuesday found a hardy, red-colored 3-liter bottle of Ecstasy, a 91-caliber handgun and three other drugs, both listed for sale on the Snyp.com website.\nAccording to court records, the 10-month-old girl was taken to the emergency room and was treated for seizures and impingement.\n']"

709,Players React to NCAA Canceling March Madness Amid Coronavirus Concerns,"['MADISON, Wis. (CNN) — Players from both colleges and professional teams stepped up to their spring games in Eugene, Ga., on Monday, echoing previous calls to find out exactly what was going on with tournament field organizers.\nJohn Faulkner, a first-year wrestling coach at Wisconsin, expressed his disappointment to the players at Mid-Mountain in Butler County and to the group he coaches and practices at Northwestern State, a program he says focuses on academics and athleticism, not tragedy.\nFaulkner said he expects the standard of excellence from every college to be matched, but he reminded fans that he believes NCAA rules will make the tournament difficult to imagine.\nFootball fans are also going to need to prepare for a number of dangers on campus, including flu-like symptoms and vomiting, Faulkner said. And the wait for football is part of a 100-day process.\n“Let’s face it, the tournament started long ago, and we want to get right back into it,” he said. “This is something that is going to be impossible.”\nMcKinley, a freshman track star, said she still expects the tournament to be a success.\n“I have almost equal expectations,” she said. “I love it so much.”\nA statement from Big Ten Conference president Garry Willard congratulated people and added that the conference stands “in strong solidarity with the football program and the NCAA Committee.”\nAnother Big Ten Conference Conference commissioner, Ohio State University president Grant Strong, called for a committee be convened to investigate the NCAA tournament.\n“The number of major sports programs that are engaged in rigorous and resource-oriented postseason play does not outweigh its importance to the entire school community,” Strong said. “If the NCAA is unable to find its way to the heart of college sports communities, as it has in virtually every other facet of life in the country, then it will not host such programs.”\nThe NCAA had been scheduled to begin taking applications for its 2014 national sportswriters’ championship in January, but it will not take applications until May, allowing some large school sports in which a person from a major school or professional sports organization play to quickly adopt or adopt new rules.\nFor now, teams from all of Wisconsin have attended games and practices at Eugene this spring, and players seem to be working to learn from the experience.\n“I haven’t had a problem getting hit. No, I don’t anticipate it getting worse,” Faulkner said. “They are ready to use their muscles. You just need to know you have a really hard day to get ready.”\nUniversity of Wisconsin athletic director Kim McSorley said she is aware of the competition from the Ivy League and even the RPI, although she has not seen it changing.\nThe country’s Big Ten conference was set to return to the NCAA Tournament as it did in 2009, but last year’s tournament was canceled because of continuing disease concerns. Tournament teams in the Big Ten lost out because of controversy with tournament rules, including increasing restrictions on the ball movements.\nOther teams include Texas and USC, while Northwestern State played the same tournament last year.\nFlorida State, the No. 2 seed, and Vanderbilt played their games at noon and said earlier today that they would again be sending as many players as possible.\nWisconsin’s FSU players, who are ranked No. 2 in the USA Today Coaches Poll, will be cheering at home on Wednesday, from Galax as the March Madness draws near.\nMcSorley said the NCAA has not reached a decision on schools that are firming their programs or are placing other teams in a position to participate at a higher level.\nShe noted that the NCAA is “dumping two much higher-ranked teams right now.”\nMcSorley, who as she prepares for the tournament in practice for a month, is optimistic that the Big Ten will be a once-in-a-generation winner and “maybe a champion in 2024.”\n“I am not one of those people that thought we could beat them in the Big Ten,” she said. “I know we are going to be going back in five years if things work out like that.”\n']"
710,"NCAA's Decision to Cancel the Big Dance Is the Right Call, Even If a Sad One","['If you missed out on Friday\'s Final Four, it has already been canceled, although tonight\'s game will be good news (genuinely) and less serious (recalling what ""if"".)\nThis season\'s Final Four has been the UConn-Kentucky game for four decades, but the Big Dance III was recently announced. Although the title has long been unknown, there is some chatter about a contest in the late \'70s featuring the Knoxville based team. Assuming Kentucky and UConn (if, as we presume, Kentucky), and Notre Dame (if, to be exact), won\'t come close to matching the story line seen in the Pac-12 Championship, this game could turn into a national event.\nAdvertisement\nBut as of today, Americans have more to lose.\nI could spend the rest of our waking hours planning for the 60 seconds of time in which I see how far this Final Four really has to go before I go home.\nIn fact, I will be traveling to watch the Final Four tonight with my husband Mike, who has been on my side the entire tournament.\nAfter seeing the Real Tar Heels win the Final Four four years ago, I will also watch another Final Four. After Oklahoma won last year\'s crown, I watched as the Crimson Tide reached the Final Four for the first time since 1993, and the Tar Heels still have the dubious honor of a Sweet 16 appearance.\nOh, and did I mention that a CBS sports poll from last Wednesday indicated that Tennessee and No. 1 UCLA did not win the national title?\nBut until Feb. 29, I still had to plan for the $5.50 Super Bowl ticket to be sold on StubHub.com.\nSo what will the higher ticket prices turn out to be? I imagine ticket broker Roth said one price, but of course, I don\'t know. And I want to point out that there is no way I can predict that again (when it comes to the Big Dance, at least).\nThe Big Dance is currently coming down because of it\'s escalating price tag. Most American households do not include ESPN\'s streaming service, ESPN Plus, on their household bill, because it costs per bill to access ESPN. The price of the service, which includes the broadcast of the national final four on ESPN2 (next season, ESPN is expected to put something similar in place), is being hiked recently, partly because of ESPN.com.\nESPN isn\'t exactly the hottest platform for baseball games. Its Price tag of $20,000 is not above a similarly expensive market rental with Amazon\'s Prime (for families in Washington or Los Angeles, so the price of an Xbox console is $400). Other times, it seems, ESPN Plus is at least a half price.\nIt makes me wonder if Amazon can really keep this price tag of ESPN Plus.\nAll in all, I do believe that although it\'s possible that ESPN will increase its price, there isn\'t a single person to support this price hike. If anything, I suspect that it will be the former, especially when it comes to sports programming and publishing. CNN won\'t allow it, and it certainly won\'t promote the sports themselves. It will be distributed live in different ways.\nNeither is ESPN Studios and its video-on-demand product ESPNU.\nMost networks are tracking the revenue impact of ESPN+ and ESPN2 among their members. Even though ESPN+ hasn\'t been advertised as such, I would find myself holding an extra $1 if I were a member.\nIt\'s been, and still is, a steady source of income for many Americans. If it were less, it would be a sad event. But the act of creating a baseline of daily revenue, as opposed to an inclusive one, doesn\'t make things easy.\nJust as it makes me think we\'ve seen those four years this close to the end of time, if we have less than 12 years to protect our traditional golden age of sports, we probably have less than 12 years to protect our beloved UConn-Kentucky. (Again, I\'ll say, although some people point out that it is close, I have no idea how many.)\n']"

Trump also issued a travel ban, parts of which were subsequently revoked, to travelers from parts of Latin America and the Middle East.\nWATCH: Trump declares emergency to fight severe outbreak of coronavirus\n""The declaration will add to our effort to significantly reduce the spread of this serious illness,"" Trump said. ""We will immediately be working to update these emergency declarations and strengthen our defenses against these deadly infections.""\nTrump noted that some critics in Congress, especially in the House, have expressed concerns that it would add confusion to the U.S. mission and undermine the nation\'s sovereignty.\n""Such fears are misguided. If countries agree to restrict their commerce, and if the U.S. maintains its use of our ports, we will be able to send and sustain our energy,"" Trump said.\nHe added that the U.S. would again vigorously fight for and will do its best to protect all people and nations from the deadly outbreak of the disease.\n""The actions made by our Administration at our ports are going to be beneficial to everyone in our country and have a positive impact on the lives of Americans throughout the world,"" he said.\n']"

721,Trump's positions on FISA and coronavirus responses stoking anxiety on Capitol Hill,"['WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s impulsive decision to issue nearly 250,000 applications to his national security officials to collect millions of government data and pat down hundreds of political dissidents — along with record-setting levels of surveillance — increased public anxiety on Capitol Hill this week, prompting lawmakers to share their view on what’s to come in the wake of the Trump administration’s decision to exclude reports on the security program.\nTrump said last week he had tapped a former FBI official to conduct several criminal investigations of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Manafort, who as a federal judge oversaw the process of carrying out Trump’s election-season travel ban, is set to testify about the possible misuse of funds when he is forced to turn over confidential documents to congressional investigators — a move that Trump suggested, in a letter to the House Judiciary Committee, that he hopes the Justice Department will take seriously.\nBut what’s to come? The House’s top Democrat, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, sought to address Monday what he called the “majority of harms” to intelligence services from the use of the program.\n“This practice is such a public health issue that we needed to (be) being extra cautious with national security efforts,” Nadler said at the House Intelligence Committee meeting. “Consequently, we’re debating whether to declassify sensitive intelligence sources and methods that we know are improperly reviewed or provided to the American people.”\nThe president’s reliance on his executive orders to ban military contractors from entering the United States and deport workers from the country is a “stunning misuse of executive power,” Nadler said. “Even if I was afraid of what the federal government was doing, I would have preferred to look in the intelligence community’s eyes and take steps to take.”\nNadler noted that some 200,000 people have been exposed to surveillance programmes such as the program known as Prism, which encourages U.S. companies to access files and apps for economic and security applications. The technology, the committee’s top Democrat said, can be used to collect “information no one else would want to see” on Americans.\nMost intelligence agencies say they have no information to recommend criminal prosecutions and have no plans to turn over files of people they suspect may have been targeted, said Acting Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Several top intelligence officials and some officials have said the program — described as “dark surveillance” — has created “gastrophilia” — an economic incentive for recipients to turn in their identities.\nCongressional Republicans questioned what could be done about the program in light of Trump’s court order to bar former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort from traveling to the United States. The Justice Department has yet to rule on whether Manafort, who is appealing his conviction, should be released.\n“I don’t think we should forget about it,” Sen. Jeff Flake, a Flake-led Arizona Republican, said at the meeting.\nCNN reached out to the Justice Department but had not yet received a response.\nContacted by a legislative aide, one press secretary declined to comment.\nRep. Steve Israel, a New York Democrat who’s known for using illegal campaign funds to secure votes on legislative priorities, said he was disappointed in the panel’s hesitation. He thanked the chairman for issuing the statement, but said he wants to “focus on a good inspector general.”\nAfter an extensive investigation, Trump issued the first reponse to the program.\nLess than a week later, he decided to review all he had acquired during his own investigation, but not all of them — including those police files — had been redrafted and compiled publicly.\nSources familiar with the program told CNN in December 2016 that the White House wanted to “overturn” changes in Manafort’s pay and benefit status, including his ability to fly for an opposition fundraising trip to Wisconsin and to perform travel to Israel.\nReuters contributed to this report.\n']"
722,The White House calculus on testing President Trump is changing,"['WASHINGTON — Until now, Trump’s campaign rhetoric wasn’t fully personal. Under his rarely heard alter-ego, Trump, the president’s success seemed a consistent effort to make people think more closely about who was voting for him.\nBut Tuesday night, on the day of Trump’s historic rally at New York’s Lincoln Center, the president appeared to change his strategy, tacitly stepping in to express his suspicions about the election’s outcome and declaring that the process was illegitimate.\n“If you want to win a fair and just election — I know that,” Trump said, according to a recording of the impromptu appearance by a reporter. “Now, let’s start there. Yes, it’s illegitimate. I’m not, you’re being dishonest — but that’s not something we want to keep under wraps.”\nLike previous election cycles, this often feels like Trump is trying to fast-track a shift of authority, especially with some political and campaign aides recently expressing their regrets that he didn’t begin his week to move quickly enough.\nThis time, the president looked fit and comfortable, at the same time failing to quite pinpoint his exact word choice.\nHe did, however, take notes on how people are feeling about the process that so many in the country have demanded since early May. Some aides consulted with a reporter said they had heard the president ask about congressional Republicans voting for impeachment.\nThe White House also noted Tuesday that the president had begun two weeks after the congressional session ended and has gained considerable momentum in areas from “grab them by the p*ssy” to “potty mouth” in the primaries.\nGroups of supporters and Democrats gathered on the steps of the Lincoln Center for the first time to hear Trump’s answers and to hear his ideas. One of them was Joan Walsh, a former Democratic congressional staffer.\n“I’m one of the ones who thought we’d done it,” she said. “I thought you guys did us proud in the Republicans’ hands, and I thought this was the best way to express that.”\nThere were at least four groups, including the NAACP and the group that approved Trump’s nomination of Jim Bridenstine to serve as attorney general.\nBradley Wiggins, a professor of political science at Boston University, took part in the Hall-of-Fame gathering.\nThere are now 18 honorary chairs, six of them candidates, in Washington, which was founded by executive director Larry Lessig in 1972.\n']"

If a child is left with traces of infection, they could be affected from time to time, the CDC said.\n“This case of carrying the influenza virus has led to high levels of vaccine use and prevention,” said Dr. Tiffany Vaden-Bauer, a viral immunologist at UC Irvine. “Instead of making sure the child is up to date on vaccines, it’s going to be much harder for them to get vaccine or get an antiviral drug at the point of exposure if they were young, pregnant or having a neurological disorder.”\nFlu season does come and go, and that means that millions of Americans — and those traveling to, and from, the Caribbean and Central and South America — will be protected from other strains of infection in the years ahead.\nMore than 2 million Americans visited the U.S. several times during last year’s flu season.\nErika J. Bellu and Victor R. Zimmerman, a retired chemistry professor and author of “Red She and Blue,” go to St. Peters Elementary School in Montclair, New Jersey, where under one of the CDC’s guidelines, students should take this week off from school to minimize exposure to the flu.\n“The best thing that they can do is push them to start taking part in the activities,” the 45-year-old mother said. “Just get them out there and give them a big hug. … They can check on their loved ones.”\n']"

""It has no other vector, not even non-respiratory infectious diseases like influenza.""\nWhat scientists have found is indeed dangerous, and probably worse than ever.\nAccording to research by one of the leading coronavirus experts in the world, Michael Mosconi of the European Centre for Infectious Diseases (ECID), coronavirus infections infected more than 1 million Australians in 1992. That figure was higher in 2013, the last year of World coronavirus Week. Overall, 350,000 of the roughly 1.4 million cases reported in Australia occurred outside of the Alps, according to CCID.\nMiddle East, Central Asian countries and low rainfall and no daytime rain, those who get the virus in their region can have it at any time.\nCompared to the US, which has traditionally had an outsized lead on coronavirus infections, a more serious complication is the transmission of the virus to the body from person to person, according to William Ketzner, a microbiologist at the Washington State University School of Tropical Medicine.\n""Probably most of this gets handled as a lifestyle change - one to slow down the rate of prevention,"" he told The Guardian.

727,Health officials often turn to praising Trump when facing tough coronavirus questions,"['CHICAGO -- It\'s almost a compulsory part of Obamacare. Because the American Health Care Act just passed the nation\'s highest court, health insurers and administrators are less likely to criticize President Donald Trump when public officials are facing questions about new viruses that cause respiratory illnesses.\nThe challenge is complicated, as health advocates are pushing the administration to change how it uses official praise. In January, for example, the Tribune reported that Republican Senate leaders had invited Alaska Gov. Mark Begich to appear at Trump\'s Mar-a-Lago resort to discuss what health experts called the ""Health Coverage Contamination Initiative"" they had put in place after discovering a second flu case in the state.\n""In the spirit of decent government, President Trump should step up and apologize for the perceived \'unnecessary\' criticism,"" wrote Logan Featherstone, the co-founder of the group Health Care for America Now, a Washington-based group opposed to big government.\nThe National Institute on Environmental Healthyhood, which administers the Act, allowed Trump to get his views known in February and joined seven other Republicans, including Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, in slapping tariffs on imports of non-melanoma skin cancers.\nThat prompted criticism, echoing language the Trump administration has used to demand and continue pressure on Trump to stop the $29 billion to $50 billion this year in $18 billion tariffs imposed on imported parts of the country\'s largest supplier.\nThe administration has not only refused to commit to committing to ending those tariffs, but Trump has also shown impatience with the unwillingness of Democratic senators to take swift action, according to Politico.\nIn recent weeks, Trump has said he wants to reinstate the tariffs by the end of this year, despite Democrats\' complaints and the administration\'s seeming lack of responsiveness on the matter.\nThe health organization agrees that endorsing the president\'s remarks is a small step in the direction of restoring public trust.\n""America and people around the world just seem to be grinding together to deal with it,"" said Angela Gardner, executive director of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois. ""People are looking for allies and they seem to be choosing whoever they think is the best person to work with.""\nHealth advocates hope the administration plans to take a more aggressive stance on health care and improve public perception of how the health care system works.\nUntil recently, health advocates had suggested that environmental workers were not some other kind of human being and that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should designate the Gulf coast region as an example of a country that could take serious steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nBut newly aware lawmakers, the administration and environmental organizations have taken steps in recent months to overhaul EPA under former Administrator Scott Pruitt. The EPA\'s Climate Action Plan, for example, offered a new set of rules for decontaminating fossil fuels, but Pruitt had been more receptive to the idea.\nStill, critics say Pruitt and its EPA directors have prioritized leaking information about potential health problems of the EPA\'s agencies, mainly from leaks of agricultural practices.\nIn response to criticism about Pruitt\'s shrinking role in EPA, the EPA issued a public statement saying the environmental agency ""will continue to work with officials in the American public on the country\'s most important health priorities and will be open to information and input from the public.""\nWith few options available to Trump, health advocates believe it\'s difficult for the administration to make any changes that won\'t be divisive, since the ACA requires all insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions and requires insurers to offer coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.\nThe ACA, which Trump inherited from his predecessor, is a complicated law with many questions to be answered, some written before anyone had read it.\nIt’s designed to protect Americans from the pitfalls of Obamacare, and it has worked, but some say it’s a lousy health care system, because of its high costs and dangers. The act also requires medical assistance for those suffering from the condition that poses a significant financial risk to taxpayers.\nThose health insurance policies can have higher premiums than medical insurance, prompting a backlash.\n']"
728,Here's what Trump's coronavirus emergency declaration does,"['WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency to move forward with his plan to defuse a deadly outbreak of deadly Salmonella bacteria.\nThe declaration is part of a new effort by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, the DEA chief, the White House physician, the Office of Dietary Supplements and the USDA’s Bureau of Livestock.\nThe declaration is designed to enable Trump to win public and congressional approval of his plan by Friday. Details of the declaration are under wraps. The White House also had not revealed details about Trump’s other emergency plans.\nTrump called for the declaration in his State of the Union address, warning that Salmonella is “reckless” and “causing massive suffering among our loved ones and nation’s health and welfare.”\nThe nation’s top veterinarian advised the president to take the “necessary actions and move forward … in any way that can help stop this horrible illness.”\nThe official statements about the emergency declaration Monday from the White House and the DEA did not provide details about the president’s “support for a world of greater and better food for all,” nor what Trump’s plan would look like.\nSalmonella is linked to cases in more than 600,000 people in the United States and more than 65,000 people worldwide.\nSalmonella is found in many packaged foods including unprocessed meats and poultry and now can cause a variety of illnesses including diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever. Symptoms can last from three to six weeks.\nRice and other poultry are the most prevalent victims of Salmonella.\nOn Friday, Trump declared a state of emergency so he could shift the blame for the outbreak to what’s known as the “big 3” — the meat-eaters, manufacturers and meat-processing companies.\nTwo salmonella outbreaks in 2010 — one in California and one in Florida — blamed stocks of unsafe food and contaminated food products at grocery stores and food-processing plants in the United States. The 2001 cases were linked to salmonella outbreak traced to the ground beef of Beef World in California.\nTrump’s order calls for him to declare a state of emergency, which would happen no matter what triggers it.\nThe first public declaration of a state of emergency was necessary to impose federal regulation on food products, a means by which the authority is extended. That was allowed as long as the order was “reasonably probable” and “certainly was not unduly adverse to national security or public health.”\nThe list of probable actions could include unannounced inspections, suspension of imports and the issuance of a release of a state of emergency.\nA third option is to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to declare a state of emergency in response to “preventable, preventable or at all cost to the national security and public health of our citizens,” the White House said in a statement.\n“We must focus on ‘protecting’ our citizens with checks and balances, just as we do our allies and all of those other things we support,” Trump said in his State of the Union address.\nIn October, an advisory panel of experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agreed that a stockpile of Salmonella-tainted chicken may not contain enough “clean” raw chicken that can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal cramps. The panel found that an active ingredient in chicken was in “almost every piece of chicken.”\nThe CDC earlier this year announced it was establishing a forensic control center at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Dallas to investigate the chain of illnesses.\n____\nAssociated Press writer Amy Forliti contributed to this report.\n']"

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., began this past weekend as the primary focus of an aide to former Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.\nStanding in the shadow of the coffee shop just north of the White House, No. 31 proclaimed himself an amiable presence. ""As I\'ve told you before, I\'ll never lie to you. I promise. I will never tell you that. And I\'ll never apologize for that,"" said No. 31, chuckling.\nThe run-up to Sunday\'s televised debate of the Democratic presidential candidates is considered one of Trump\'s biggest draws in early April. While Sanders has long advocated taking the fight to the ""voter suppression"" of the 2016 elections and the ongoing health care debate, he has received critical support from the Sanders camp in the last two days of the primary — including a half-hour interview in which the Vermont senator predicted Sanders would win the election.\nOn Sunday, Sanders met with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and state Sen. Dan Squadron, the wife of former Newark mayor Cory Booker, to continue the conversation on voting rights, health care and immigration.\nThe outreach to the Sanders camp comes after other candidates, including George W. Bush and John Kerry, also gathered national attention for their critiques of the Trump campaign.\nDe Blasio, who has yet to officially endorse Trump, speaks at the White House on Sunday and is expected to visit the White House on Monday.\nBut despite being closely aligned with Sanders, the Vermont senator has been considered for a slew of positions. Among those:\nDemocratic National Committee chairman Jim Messina.\nPhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney.\nA few weeks ago, Sanders took to Twitter to address a burning issue: ""Was never supposed to be an adviser in the beginning; Let\'s Move is a movement where everyone but Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton can work together. Focus on kids and families. Stop lying.""\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., is also weighing a presidential bid, said Michelle Cole, spokeswoman for Gillibrand. The senator has stated her intention to run in 2020 and is working with the party on creating a working group to help candidates create awareness of their proposals and their political action committee plans, a campaign staffer said.\nGov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., offered to campaign for No. 31 in a letter endorsing his effort.\nSanders, Ben Carson, Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Bill de Blasio have all taken pitches from the campaign.\nDe Blasio is said to be finalizing details of several political events that are planned for the New York delegation this weekend. He will get a tour of the former Westchester County Executive Charlie Branca\'s home before heading to the campaign trail.\nTeam Sanders has been sending the secretary of state\'s office a month of campaign updates, and Kennedy even makes an appearance with the Democratic National Committee.\nA New Jersey delegate reported the news in a tweet that morning: ""Sen. Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz are gearing up for the primary & declaring their intention to run in the general. Serious candidates and lots of support have been pouring in to help us build their campaign!""\nVermont Gov. Tom Kean has said he is optimistic about the potential of the Vermont senator. He tweeted on Saturday: ""We are building a strong team. We have knocked on 600 doors so far and got a huge amount of support.""\nOne Democratic source said Sanders ""seems to have seen the writing on the wall.""\n""The key word on this campaign is reach,"" the source said. ""It\'s not going to happen overnight, but he has built a team and more importantly, it is expanding the base of support for him.""\n']"

Today, Canada has created nearly 10,000 new jobs in coal mining. An increase in jobs is expected in the future, say economists, but some aren’t sure it will be enough to reverse the climate disaster here.\nJapan: An outsize problem.\nAustralia: Extensive data breaches have left much of the Australian economy bleeding.\nThe US: An economically dysfunctional economy with a brutal population.\nTurkey: The country’s ailing economy.\nAustralia: Erdogan, a longtime friend, serves on the Supreme Election Panel.\nGermany: The bar for being both hipster and hip-hop icon was lowered on corruption after the brouhaha over the Bilderberg Summit's definition of “classical”. (For its various kooky chutzpah, you can’t help thinking of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has seen previously about every weekend, from 11 p.m. TV to News of the World.)\nOnly a few were notable at the weekend: In a bid to end the intense controversy surrounding Turkey's membership of the European Union, Erdogan went for only Facebook, tweeting just after midnight and proudly donating to Germany’s bid for a Brexit, handing a €6.5 billion ($7.5 billion) donation to Germany’s judicial charity. (Oh, and, of course, he was spotted reading at a gala last year that suggested a winning candidate’s “legitimate” candidacy.)\nWe're so lucky to have the entire European Union intact that the event is all but closed off to other European nations.\nSome would argue that the left-leaning and mostly apolitical Erdogan represents the “left-wing authoritarian rise of the ruling party” — which is why it was selected for Tuesday’s election, rather than any other political party. He risks competing in all sorts of elections across Europe, and that may explain the vote’s status as a proxy for a protest movement.\nAnother poll has suggested, for instance, that if the June 19 vote in Turkey is anything like the Brexit vote in England last year, Erdogan would win a landslide victory — 20 percent to 39 percent — as long as there’s a continued trifecta of new independent governments (for now, not for another 20 or 25 years).\n***\nAs a disclaimer for this particular interview, I wanted to answer these questions for you as well.

Another person could not be located, but the senator said they did not know who provided that information and ""something still needs to be done.""\nThe senator added that it will take time for various departments to determine whether all four individuals will be able to participate in the new program.\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services said this week that several Cruz\'s affairs ""remain closely-committed.""\nCruz said he was grateful that he stayed in the Senate for more than 30 days and could not have made a decision if he did not want to be in the mix. The senator\'s initial plans included a Friday meeting at his Pennsylvania ranch and a Monday news conference.\nAt that time, Cruz decided to step back from his final, individual-mandated visit to prevent the end-of-year shutdown. ""If I have any bad health issues, [I\'ll] stay home and worry about being in the team instead of hanging out with people who have bad health issues that need to be resolved as a part of my schedule,"" Cruz said in the interview.\nContrary to the initial account provided by the senator\'s account, the hat-tip to ""Scrubs"" actor Anthony Scaramucci while he was on ""Scrubs"" said he had a few complications because of his recent return from a trip to the Bahamas, reports CBS News.\nScamucci said at the time that he returned from the Bahamas with a ""valley doctor"" and tested positive for the newly identified coronavirus.\nSEE ALSO: ""Scrubs\' Matt Damon on Being Named A Superficial Attorney\'\nCruz would not be drawn on whether he would be able to participate in the planned program, instead saying he had to wait for the request from the White House and then wait for an initial announcement.\nBut he did note that he\'d had a few ""unusual"" visits to visit patients in the hospital with a reaction to the vaccine, and on Tuesday he added his name to a list of people taking one of ""three or four"" shots while living in a county hospital and receiving treatment there.\n""I don\'t want to say that everyone is going to be going back. This is a unique experience of sickness for people but for me to come back and be myself and a part of this, I did it this time around — this moment,"" Cruz said.\nAfter the first dose of the new vaccine came into effect in mid-February, the Senate Health and Human Services Committee asked for information about Cruz\'s past behavior with the HOPE study, which was independently financed by Obama\'s campaign. Cruz\'s response is that was in part because of the work he was doing to convince an early group of physicians that the new vaccine protects against the fatal vaccine Chikungunya.\n']"

After that, it would have flown into the territory of Guam.\nNorth Korea carried out another successful test of its new warhead in 2017, which it tested by taking back one on the test range.\nThe missile is “very effective” in its ""conventional"" electromagnetic pulse (EMP) range, which is designed to allow it to reach the South and reach North Korea from major ports, according to CXO Young-sun, head of the US-based non-proliferation program at the World Foundation in Beijing.\nThe Obama administration launched a missile defence system that would defend the U.S. against North Korea’s threats to strike the Pacific.

733,"Coronavirus outbreak worsens in Italy and Japan, as situation stabilizes in China","['By Mary Altaffer\nANCHORAGE, Alaska (CNN) — There are huge signs that the eruption of a new outbreak of pathogenic E. coli and E. coli spreading from the Middle East to Western Europe, say researchers.\nEarlier this week, researchers in Italy and Japan sent out radio messages warning their people that health authorities were developing an outbreak.\nThen health officials deployed a thermal imaging robot to measure the island of Alaskan Inchua, based on reports from North Korea, Iran and China.\nThe island is smaller and at lower elevations than mainland. Residents there said they don’t feel the isolation, prompting the data to be sent to city authorities for possible quarantine.\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also sent out simultaneous alerts, which revealed the latest bout of the illness — adding to recent claims that the outbreak could have reached the same spots across a larger area.\nThe Centers for Disease Control has been reporting “contained” E. coli cases in Hawaii and neighboring states; they say this is the first infestation in many years.\n“We know what happened with this fungus,” Sara Baker, a professor at the Indiana University Bloomington School of Public Health in Indiana, told CNN’s Crime Lab. “This is a mass outbreak. It’s sort of extraordinary.”\nThere are likely to be a broader group of new infections and longer incubation periods for the person causing the initial outbreak, but she cautioned that the number of people who begin to contract the illness could be much larger than the old doomsday, and explains why high awareness is needed.\nTo shut the door on entry, doctors use these detectors to indicate the location of a water leak or that there is bacteria.\nThough HSC sets the alarm on a case per day at least twice a week, that time in mid-February is the most intensive part of the outbreak, which happened on the islands of Hilo and Sapporo between February and March.\nIn January, Hawaii confirmed an E. coli outbreak that has infected 21 people, where samples were sent to the CDC for testing.\nIn the most recent outbreak, E. coli infection in three others appeared late in the spring and on Feb. 9 were confirmed in two people, who ended up in a nearby hospital. The new E. colis are very close to the oldest-known signs of the virus.\nMost have yet to be tested for the virus, but have been confirmed as having caught the disease from an E. coli generated by Japan or China.\nSome days, for example, a patient who was at the main hospital in Frankfurt but given antibiotics died, according to a study released by the German Ministry of Health.\nUntil now, the most plausible explanation for the outbreak was in part from the sheer scale of the global cluster of cases: 13.6 million people and 10.9 million cases globally.\n“This new E. coli outbreak places a huge demand on the future medical standard of care in terms of laboratory screening and diagnosis,” said Dr. Oliver Gilman, director of the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics.\nThose measures have likely prevented more than 1,200 E. coli cases from a year earlier.\nLast month, the World Health Organization declared an outbreak in Japan to be linked to an E. coli strain, but the actual number of infections was considerably lower.\n']"

The individual in Dalian from China had been diagnosed with last May, and those involved were being monitored.\n“This is a result of our engagement with the Beijing region and its inhabitants and alerting the general public,” he said.\nBeijing authorities have not said if there is any confirmed case of the new virus. On Friday, those not linked to it were also kept apart.\nThe university and health ministry had also announced measures to minimise the threat posed by the virus. Beijing government activists and a committee on international health fairs held anti-extinguishing vigils to show solidarity with the families and victims of the disease.\nXi and his “Businessmen’s Day” tour began here on Thursday with a public meeting with 15 local and foreign entrepreneurs.\nBut the visit was overshadowed by the fatal hospitalization of a patient who contracted the virus after sitting on the road for hours without being detected.\n“We have imposed measures to ensure the progress of the outbreak,” said Wang Yikong, a spokesman for Beijing Health and Welfare Ministry, also saying Beijing administration “deployed resources to keep health in the best condition of its citizens.”\nHis statement echoed what other administration officials had recently noted, but did not indicate when the vaccines and interventions would be released.\nWhile Wang was not in China, he assured world leaders, government officials and civil society that the outbreak had been “tough and needless” and vowed a more effective response to the virus.\nThe disease is so frequently seen in Japan, the United States and Europe that local governments have high hopes it will be passed on to other countries that also are contributing organs, experts said.\nBeijing has been fighting against flu and RSV in control, in part to hold their viral reservoir private and controlled.

739,March 8 coronavirus news,"['(CNN) — The Venezuelan government has decided to go ahead with curbing import of brackish brackish water to cater to the seasonal fall season, ministry of information director Isaac Emoto said Tuesday.\nThe decision to make a preventive measure out of what is already a stormy start to the rice season, said Emoto, who was not authorized to speak about the decision publicly.\nThe government routinely stages certain types of brackish water shipments from ships to normal waters. Experts say the seasonal season of rain, extreme heat and severe drought are the major problems seen in the region.\nIn February, the government was in the midst of a significant and unprecedented post-vote drought crisis, when bananas were rotting at ports and farmers found their crops were turned into seed. Because the rains were such a dry season, they dried out.\n“February is like a very protracted, serious crisis because the monsoon season is already beginning and which means there’s a lot of rain and potentially some beneficial tetracyclines,” Emoto said.\nThe new curbing is yet another bite into the rotation of the banana crop that has grown rapidly since the rainy season began in November 2014. Blasco, the crop in Caracas state where the central government controls the water system, is one of the most important crops in Venezuela, accounting for almost 25% of the world’s bananas.\nThe new curbing is aimed at curbing the growing influence of the brackish brackish water in northwestern Venezuela, the westmost port of the Sultana highway known for a booming rice harvest.\nFarmers have exported brackish brackish water from neighboring provinces near Caracas to avoid Brazil, a country in which the rain is usually deficient.\nVanilla cup\nTransportation of brackish brackish water supplies to the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, have been increased since the drug violence of 2016. The government is planning to begin shipments soon.\nFarms of bananas near Caracas have been threatened with closure because of the increased quantities of brackish water destined for other rivers in the country.\nThe government banned brackish importation in 2014. That ban was lifted in 2016, after a caravan carrying laborers, farmers and employees of local textile factories stepped over a black-and-yellow tank on which the water was stored, giving smugglers a ride to pick up the materials from nearby waterways.\nCaracas’ regional governor, Gustavo Hurtado, is tasked with supervising the rollout of the ban on brackish water shipments.\nIf the ban continues as planned, production from the illegal crops in the highway that runs from Caracas to the port of Aragua will decline, Hurtado said.\nIn recent months, the move has been met with protests from banana farmers who said they suffered real losses due to damaged crops and panicked tourists leaving their tourist zone.\nOrganizations such as the Bolivarian Alliance for the Colonization and the National Congress of South America (ACSA) and América Móvil — whose work includes producing bananas, sugarcane and peaches, among other fruits — say they don’t have enough of the 15,000 people in the country to function normally.\nChavez and his brother, Hugo Chávez, are longtime supporters of his socialist “Liberty and Socialism,” which would be in effect a national independence and peace initiative if Chavez and his opponents were to lose their House of Representatives and ensure the continuation of the socialist movement.\nThe formal launch of the new curbing order comes as negotiations on a new deal between Chávez and his fellow members of his ruling National Guard, the Supreme Army, are ongoing. The government has said that it is still mulling the merits of the pact.\nThe government’s Monday decision to cut the import of industrial water from Baja state and delay the shipment of extra brackish water to Aragua through late spring has been met with speculation that the plan will end up easing the tensions around the regional dispute.\nExperts say the demand from Mexico to allow the delivery of up to 2,000 tons of the extra brackish water to the region is a significant blow to the country’s central demand to increase its ability to reduce its dependence on its exports, said Saul Murillo, an expert on tropical agriculture at the Institute of Agricultural Education in Cuba.\n']"

When asked if the viral disease is contagious, she said, “Not at all.”\nThe sudden outbreak of two cases in a single day was a turning point in the disease outbreak, where, on average, every infected person dies.\nIn March, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 91,000 cases of disease in the United States, the largest recent outbreak of the deadly virus. Two months later, the number rose to 105,000, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saying 19,326 cases of disease have been recorded in America.\nWatching that trickle and seeing that number go up, Gaylaris, a mother of two, climbed back to help people on Saturday.\nShe listened as her boyfriend reached for a bottle.\n“Hold on, watch how you are, you can’t bear to watch, it’s horrible, and you want to just throw away all your medication,” Gaylaris said.\nInfected\nIn March, infected people died from the virus in eastern parts of the world, including the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Sweden, and Thailand.\nA first wave of the disease, which causes fainting and sickle cell disease in people, was seen in October in the central Philippines. The virus has spread rapidly and more people have been infected.\nBut, gay men like Robina King came forth and joined in the mass public health efforts last month.\nThe Dominican Republic, Cambodia, Vietnam, Greece, and Saudi Arabia had reached the one million mark as they faced the outbreak.\nKing’s cousin, Simor Jalan, says he and his 15 friends decided to do something with their lives in March to save their family’s lives.\n“I was curious,” he said on CNN’s “The Fastest Hits” program. “I was really scared, we felt it would happen to us. So we took action.\n“We saw the age of the virus and we started to wonder, why did this happen to us? And what were the progenitors of this virus?”\n“Things like that make us think that we’re living on another planet — and that they are actually less protected than we were.”\nSame-sex couples, but come together\nAt first, gay men like Jalan were eager to escape the virus as opposed to bringing it to the family.\n“But we came together,” he said. “We want to help. Just like us.”\nAcross the USA, where a blanket ban on same-sex marriage has created trouble with the nation’s prominent Democrats, gay communities and AIDS groups have worked together to avert potential miscarriages.\n“The last few days have been so surreal,” Marcia Parrella, executive director of the gay and lesbian Vogue.com, told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “We’ve had the unimaginable experiences. There’s not that many coming together like we did today.”\nParrella estimates that between 3 million and 5 million people who have never been seen or heard from a loved one due to HIV infection will die from the virus in 2018 alone.\n']"

The explosion was so huge that rubble from a traman billowed and people were seen streaming out of windows and ""crying death at the sight of the victims.""\nThe World War II-era theater bombing was ruled by a fire department and was declared an off-site incident.\nThe famous theater bombing in Tokyo\'s Twentieth Century Theater, Tokyo, is officially called the ""Bomb Shondaland Theater,"" according to the Hotel Tokyo. The bomb was ruled a hoax with no real threat to Tokyo residents or the city government.\nAccording to CNN, none of the theater\'s survivors will ever know about the bombing, which many experts believe was aimed at the elderly when the theater was located, although they have identified some as members of the public. There are residents who have repeatedly said their memories were very bad or that they never saw the devastation that went on.\nAccording to Travel + Leisure, ""we found out there were only a handful of theaters where they came close to filling every little spot that was damaged, including the piers that actually served as parking lot for the theaters.""\nAs CNN reports, there are two theaters that are still in use, Hiroshima\'s Cyber Reserve and the Citadel, which was one of those theaters that was bombed in Tokyo on Aug. 8, 1945.\nEarlier in November, ""we found out that the Citadel became a replacement for the bomber bombing on the grounds of Hiroshima.""\n']"

Indoor gathering places were set up around the city of Peshawar and other towns of the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. At least two people had injuries, authorities said.\nIn Pakistan, however, they are still unsure whether they’ll ever hear from their constitutional representatives.\nThe Army sees this as a turning point in their long fight for equality. The battle appears to be picking up pace:\nOn Friday, military chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani said that the government will consider gender equality as an issue for “most likely” elections. He promised that only elections will be held “when there is a chance that there will be major change” in Pakistan.\nInitially, Muslims have opposed gender discrimination against women.

So this year has been one of the World's cheapest draft beers in the region: West Maui's 15-cent draft was $4.25 and the country's most expensive draft of beer — Hanoi's 25-cent beer — was $4.55. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that city residents see a 22-cent difference in the price between beer and hard liquor. John Britton, owner of Lucky Lazy on the Pacific Coast, told me he has paid a total of $11,000 in for on-site soft drinks and wine. So are there any other freebies? I can only guess. Complimentary mint teas included for Hanoi locals — Feb. 17 at Leo’s Mart by PetroRich — among other wine offerings. But where are your sweet clods? The Vancouver Sun's Mimi Nguyen asks … after the ride. Let's just admit it: Not only is it high-octane, but the Hanoi Tart Ale is the summer-camp to three-foot bottles, too. Apologies, but I’m usually pretty sour. Some of my neighbors drop $400 for a pint of Hanoi’s biggest soft drink to find here.\nSamuel Harvey “This one is up in Boston for two weeks. Haven’t gotten it yet, but if you come along, it’s $5.90,” according to the Boston Herald. How would that work out here: Boston’s inexpensive draught beer? $7.50! That’s a scorching price to blow away the Stockholm Oven-o-Lago deal ($15.90). And hagiography aside, that price doesn’t seem like much of a bother.\nWhat are the rules for getting a drink here? “It’s best to get a ‘drive-thru’ when it’s hot,” says Andras Fernirze, author of The White House Diner. For Boston, stop at Taste Garden in Grandma’s Raglan Square in Bridgehampton, then head right down to Tart. It’s a dainty, old-school bar, the talkative, and mostly alcohol-infused brew by Oscar.\nOh and don’t get cocky, there’s always Costa Rican beer to save some calories: M-Fruta del Amo, offered this hot and cold a day only in Hanoi (twice as good as South Korea and San Francisco) turns out to be the top-of-the-brite local brew, with pisco puree, plum-tomato-tay, butchers’ bread, and vanilla foam. A can of Martinis made from M-Fruta’s can also has sales at many coffee shops in Hanoi.\nJennifer Love Carey “What comes to mind was a recommended sample from Hong Kong’s top beerstore JW Brewing, a pale ale made the highest in Vancouver of the top 10 beers that were specially judged by a six-year-old New Yorker.” And not surprisingly, there’s a beer for people 14 and over: Imperial IPA, Budweiser Astro, and sparkling, topped out at 9.5% ABV. I suppose Johnny Hendry’s version is funnier than the Japanese version I found in California’s Douses. (No bad thing there.) John Varvatos says to tip tip when buying craft beer from the national trade body for the sake.

Only eight airlines offered daily nonstop travel on American passenger aircraft.\nThe highest Crossings class of 184 seats were in Japan and 29 were in the Republic of Korea. The second-class (first and first passengers) seats were actually designated for non-American guests only, though three Air Togo and four Grande airlines did offer partial service, as did Japan\'s Shinta.\n""Overall, the Crossings program is enjoying a nice boost,"" said Nee-Ryabashi.

753,Preserving Macao's bamboo tradition through sculptural works,"['Recently, five local experts met with WeedsFest, China\'s premier event for display of traditional works from Vanathan State National Culture Center in the southern province of Macao.\nThis week, they were on hand to talk about the new art exhibition Preserving Macao\'s bamboo tradition through sculptural works.\n“This is not a county-of-paper show, it\'s a exhibition that brings this county in line,” said Carl Vanderpuglij , a visiting professor at the University of Lausanne who\'s been studying tradition for over 10 years. “We have some old timber buildings in this beautiful, bare, clean golden-looking setting where modern artists have come to decorate them with real artifacts, regardless of their shape or color.”\nVanderpuglij and his co-curators, Edmund and Anna Vanathan, led a panel discussion with several local experts and Chinatown curators who represent the region as a whole.\nThe entire panel, which included three University of Lausanne professors who taught at the Philadelphia Art Museum, was a panel of 70 top experts that explored preserving one of China\'s most traditional and historically historical buildings.\nInside the exhibit, carved cypress trees, bamboo flooring, mechanical bells, & motor trellises, palentulas, carved oaks, and bao knolls portray cultures around China and in Macao - many of whom were “borrowed” from the impoverished southern region and re-wilded into its traditional culture. There, scholars show photos of workers growing these delicate sculptures.\nOne well-known artist also mentioned her website, which includes photos of the work she does with artists, installations, puppet shows, concerts, and improvisational jams.\n“If you do this kind of work, or you take this kind of work into some kind of nature preserve, it\'s not really for your own benefit,” she said. “It\'s for the cooperation of other artists in nature preservation. So, it\'s not your own private activity. It\'s theirs. I mean it just happens in my personal interpretation.”\nThe experts at Preserving Macao spoke about the uniqueness of the now-small-and-dubbed ""scripted film"" that the local artists are working on. Using a backward-looking computer protocol, the visual interplay of digital and analog productions is available in a virtual stage.\nVisualize these rich scenes and make them necessary for the visitor\'s ego-trip to Mars.\n“What I\'m trying to do here is for the visitor to take these images into their own category and also interpret them for themselves,” said Vanderpuglij. “It\'s a very talented team of artists that are using computer-based equipment, which is very developed for centuries, to use these shots with art without physical change. So they are using a virtual camera in their own interpretation of these amazing [images].”\nThe researchers pointed out that people aren\'t necessarily aware of the history of this famous human civilisation, what they refer to as the “First Four:” Originally depicted in the Renaissance, these statues of ancient saplings, godless giants (thought to have died to help rebuild a vain emperor) are found around China in flowerpot, traditional style. Later, artists unearthed links to them.\nNow, they are ready to ""made"" the Internet. Using real human faces and technologically-enhanced, highly accurate rendering, Vanderpuglij and Vanathan launched the ""TVC Print Machine"" on their short-lived Jine Design at WeedsFest, China’s premier event for display of traditional works from Vanathan State National Culture Center in the southern province of Macao.\n“We try to keep the framework of this entire culture alive throughout our lectures,” said Vanderpuglij. “So we want to communicate that these truly historical, legally protected, artificial cultural structures have a future in the future and are objects and art objects of the imagination.""\nAn excerpt from the exhibit (and the lecture): “Decorating Cities of Old & New”\n']"
754,Preserving Macao's handmade signs in the digital age,"['The Macao seal of security may be permanently lost, but for the post office, they are close to reality.\nIt\'s an old place, in the eyes of longtime Macao resident Olga Palmer. Palmer\'s family grows trees and grows country fruits, and her two children and grandchildren grew up in the Yellowum National Forest -- not far from the airport.\n""When I came here, I decided to start using my visits there to preserve them. They were maintained there, they were placed in the forests of the national forest,"" said Palmer, 75.\nThe landscape on National Forest Road is a landscape of trees, ragged weeds, mulch, foliage and other dirt that national forests traditionally send out in the summer, when the temperatures are hottest. These nights, from July through October, in which Macao\'s large Easter celebrations take place, are set by modern easter egg markers: Designs in nature can be different from those in streets, homes and even airport windows.\nSome old markers are up to 15 feet long. Further away is an ornamental icon, laid on a potted tree on a riverine shore, where there is no evidence to show it was deposited by the federal government. In addition, hundreds of wooden crosses have been erected around the region, similar to local folklore; they are of some kind, and can be used to decorate a holiday tree.\nBernardo Itagaki, owner of a post office in the National Forest, which insures its goods in the forest, said that the trees have not been lost. He notes that the plants\' characteristics are listed on the more than 50,000 columns of salvaged masonry still in the forest.\n""I think the culture can change dramatically. We won\'t never recover from the loss of the old institution. Things cannot continue,"" said Itagaki.\nThe Daily Wong Dee sits in the forest, right next to a mahout tree. Like other traditional period souvenirs in Macao, it reminds visitors of its rich past, at least from an environmental standpoint. In case the folk folk are unfamiliar with old wood art or haven\'t spotted any vintage prints, they have actually discovered such colonial masonry on their own.\nHaving bought one in the past couple of years, it has taken three months to rustle and stamp a few different vintage wallpaper items in the long history of the museum. It now has a selection of red, white and blue ""Mee"" patches painted with lilies and violets. Since it is an old art museum, the rest have been taken care of at a cost of about $25,000.\nOlava Mondarestakis, who is also a director of the official post office, offers extended tales of previous memory in the shrine. He says now his shop is owned by his sons, who run the place all the time. They developed traditions for his shop based on the flora and fauna in Macao\'s forest.\n""This is a very large family in the forest,"" Mondarestakis said.\n']"
755,"'Like the tart, I never change': The secret behind Macao's most famous dessert","['(CNN) — Macao is a confection, not just one of many restaurants, but a culinary institution that delivers a handful of decadent bests to customers in the capital city and among them, the traditional “Macao Yummie.”\nThe famous dessert is in the heart of Macao, like the young, glamorous Upper East Side of Manhattan. But the secret behind the famous dessert is the centre of the massed traffic, and its entrance at Marine One pier and the vacation terminal is an unlikely one, partly because of the two central apartments and the surrounding suburb of Grand Central Terminal.\nAccording to Forbes, the simplest way to find out what to eat at a popular dining spot in China is to look up the menu for the Macao Peninsula and try to sample some of the finest restaurants in the region. The destination gets attention from locals and tourists as only one of the world’s most photographed cities is known. If Macao doesn’t have a dessert, where does it go from there?\nThinking of dining at Macao Peninsula\nMario Batali, who owns the famous chain of Batali restaurants, says Macao Peninsula still gets its share of attention. “Macao has its own ambience, which gives restaurants a real benefit of crossing several sides to reach different people and different surroundings,” he said. “But the two main locations of the city are really the same. The person eating at the Peninsula is still eating on their own plates. It is a very modern experience, and there are a lot of activities for people.”\nPortraits Of ‘Macao Yummie’\nThe top three restaurants in Macao Peninsula are relatively unknown outside of the city. One was not known as a hot restaurant. Another did not travel the mainland, but decided to expand to a larger area called Tianjing.\nThe locals who wander here on their day off and look up see the name of Macao Peninsula and claim that it’s one of the city’s two most visited places on the Internet.\nNow it does not matter. All you need to do is walk into the Information Center, a yellow brick building on the second floor and ask for directions. Once you arrive, you can drag your bags on to a few tables across the street and hang out with local and world-renowned chefs like Patina Pong, who have the privilege of overseeing an extensive menu at its restaurants.\nAs more restaurants open here on the mainland, others begin to eat there. Togo Grill, a lounge-style restaurant that serves country food, was created just to serve Macao’s northern Chinese population.\n“This place has really changed me because there’s so much more attention to Macao and this is where I realized that if I want to go to culinary school I need to see what I can actually get into,” Sisco told CNN at the Fine Art Institute.\nHigh Times:\nIs it Macao’s most famous dessert?\n“I feel like I better see it, because people go to New York to get a chance to go out and taste Macao. People who have gone to a big city may be unfamiliar with it,” Kuho says. “But it’s the crowd that goes to Chinatown and other restaurants that travels there and hosts free events. Those people have the right of taking their whole city along, like a good downtown.”\nShe says restaurants are eating directly at different people’s eyes. “They can get a bite to eat and they can experience a party, they can go get something from a restaurant and they can do something from a table. The idea is to connect the people and make each other feel part of the city, which is a very important thing.”\nIs Macao, now nicknamed ‘Dynastic’ or ‘Dynastic’?\nEvery day of the year, many people call Manganese Beach. The 100-acre island, located between Beja Island and Pao Bingo, symbolizes how Macao influences China. That part of the mainland has fallen under China’s national jurisdiction since the Chinese Communist revolution in 1949.\nOn the mainland, however, there is an icon of sovereignty: Macao. On June 29, 2005, the capital city hosted the newly inaugurated Olympic Games, which took place 10 days after Macao.\n']"
756,Preserving Macao's bamboo tradition through sculptural works,"['ATLANTA — Food trends and macro trends have made the art of landscaping all the more attractive. Of course, flowers produce whole plants and oversize hibiscus plants, or garden mowers can grow that huge and valuable but still flexible animals to deliver plants to us. Our gardens provide a versatile habitat where humans can experience food, shelter, even a day after work as we dry out. We cannot go anywhere without growing vegetables, and many of our home gardens offer innovative uses.\nFor centuries, East Asian designers and craftsmen cultivated nearly 20 million pieces of cutout bamboo for natural form as an ornamental tool for intricate construction and the creation of landscaping. Today, all out efforts to preserve and add life-giving plants for recreation and leisure are often dismissed because of unrealistic notions about their growth potential. Not so, say the global skills certification industry.\nHowever, successful sales of made and replanted bamboo have helped spook the market away from its arrogant creationism. A recent study by Rustedwood Marketplace conducted by the non-profit Intellectual Property Institute found that the best of urban and small commercial gardens are all built with bamboo. The most sustainable and environmentally friendly are those with native plants such as mango trees, wild leeks, honeysuckle, pineapple, pomegranate, cabbage, trucine, arboreal and fuchsia.\nBefore soil has to be crushed to create a ready-to-plow vegetable garden, locally grown and planted bamboo requires the correct mix of high and low-tolerant blooms. Tall, thick bamboo are best suited for tough, hard soil with great water, few pests and only less than 3% brown and matted during the late season, as compared to tungsten.\nCleveland native bamboo, commonly called the first nature bamboo or “first era,” was first cultivated in China and known as the “First Big Purchase.” By the mid-19th century, bamboo impractically supported nearly half of the basket basket of commodities traded. Chinese nationals settled on the beautiful Indian territory in the middle of the 19th century to protect and cultivate the bamboo traditions.\nThe fire of bamboo followed by flight and lightning during the Thai-Swiss SARS outbreak made it a cultural staple on the East Asian side of the globe. In the mid-19th century, people practiced daily fluffing with bamboo and celebrating the bountiful fruits of the bani.\nLungs made from bamboo rose shapes formed the foundation of bamboo and Indonesian carpets of the British H&I company Bamboo Made In Britain and Kao Little Buggery of India produced the first Thai dish, one of the largest in the world. To pay respect to the Asian tradition of planting and harvesting bamboo, Buddhist leaders should plant a variety of traditional bamboo shrubs. But by the mid-1950s bamboo was a staple in ancient Indonesian gardens.\nCopyright 2019 All rights reserved.\n']"
757,The master shipbuilder keeping Macao's maritime past alive -- in miniature,"['In January 2013, Antuan B. Peng of Crédit Construction said that port calls would be delayed by weeks and at some point, port officers would take action.\nPeng, who had joined the company in 1997, recalls his first port call: with an all-white shaver -- which, he says, was originally supposed to be a hobby. Peng\'s first port call, for example, was for soybeans, although there were only more than 200 shipments in the beginning of 2012.\n""After the first call, there was no activity,"" he told Power Money. ""Instead, the sirens from Gwenda Yacht Club (Chennai) would appear at 10 p.m. (local time), and the ship would hang in the middle of the night without a port call.""\nRelated content You\'ll soon get a fleet of shipbuilders\nPeng recalls that the ship was about to load its cargo along with its leader, was sailing up the Indian Ocean, and managed to negotiate the ""perfect passage"" through the German harbors of Koln, Palau and Messerschmitt. It was that rare occurrence that made the first port call a very special one.\nPeng had been staying in China with his uncle and a friend, who was late and had to hold a cookout in the shipyard\'s dining room -- sort of like a high school cooking school -- and there was ""no one in the family where I learned my Chinese cooking skills,"" Peng told Power Money.\nLater that month, he and other cabin servants disembarked from the ship and went to dance with them.\n""At lunchtime, we were all sitting at a table on the boat in the harbour,"" Peng recalled. ""We were sat in the middle of a motor boat, with a man in a wooden chair, and we all played the Western music for three or four minutes. As everyone got ready to leave, a party of about 50 party-goers began acting like it was an all-male party.""\nSuddenly, some people started shooting rounds at the living room where gambling was taking place.\n""Everyone\'s very upset,"" Peng said. ""So I put the TV up, and about ten seconds later, I heard someone banging on the wall and flames shooting through the room.""\nThe fire was later extinguished by some guests, but there was blood and smoke. ""I wasn\'t used to smoking, just on vacation,"" he said.\nSoon, Peng and other Chinese cabin servants caught the brunt of the fire. ""When I arrived home at 7 a.m. (local time), the fire was well contained,"" he recalled.\n""We were asleep at the time, and I said, \'Why are you smoking?\'"" Peng recalls. ""It was kind of ironic to me because I was smoking so much tobacco at the time.""\nThe fire had also brought new challenges to port life.\n""We couldn\'t have been on a ship that day since the fire was so massive,"" he said.\nPeng adds that Zhongyun Island, Tanggu, Nanyang and Shipco-Chongyang have since been busy with shipbuilders using its maritime past to enhance their infrastructure -- including land and water transportation.\nPeng remembers sailing ""a lot,"" including the RMS Victoria, which had to be renamed the Blue Dragon. ""I remember the USS Corpus, "" his girlfriend, ""the house"" and then the sea bridge, which turned into a memorial to him and his six comrades. ""You\'d go to China and live with a ship for two or three years and it would just be empty.

758,Tokyo transformed: Global sporting events put spotlight on Japan's capital,"['It\'s no exaggeration to say Japan has changed when it comes to the way the country looks towards the future.\nStarting from the 18th century, Tokyo became a launching pad for sports in Japan.\nOver the next 20 years, a 15,000-strong main town and 20,000-mile motorway rolling toward Tokyo were transformed as the car-obsessed capital built over two centuries.\nSkimming over the city from Grand Canyon to the grand Japan Monument, they also connected Tokyo with several major sports venues including the legendary Kobe Steel.\nToday, Tokyo still shares most of the same historic roots as the city it was built upon.\nRear of the Bomb: The Tokyo Bus\nThere were great and devastating battles in the first half of the 20th century, but came a generation of memorable things to do:\nLand not seen since Death\nBeing welcomed back to the city as Japan\'s first one-of-a-kind tourist attraction\nResidents — some 98,000 in total — along with tourists lined up outside the gates to say goodbye to their city.\nAlong with making rail service alive, the Tokyo Bus created the world\'s first trail.\nWeighing 120 riders, the journey took from the Tokyo Railway Station in eastern Japan to Danyu, in the heart of the city.\nThis is the Kuroiachi train station, the “bombichi diket” station where a tram terminates and it uses a single left hand rotating wooden platform as a small fishing and hunting platform that leads to Larned Bully, the famous Tokyo junction.\nThe idea was that rolling horse-drawn horse tram cars would flow across the railway station, the exact opposite of what the Bus accomplishes.\nTokyo told CNN that some spectators would get scolded after reaching Larned Bully and later massed onto the track.\nEvery time that bumpy track was clogged, the people disembarked at Larned Bully, so they could catch a ride.\nIt took the train five minutes to reach Larned Bully.\n“I could no longer carry this train because I felt left out in the wrong place,” said one of the passengers, Ogun Dazonawase, 84.\nFor the former slum dweller and local gym teacher, the plan was also to find a way to ferry his kids to and from school.\nUltimately, then-Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso ""snapped"" Oda, a socialist, in the corner, thanks to an innovative Japanese concept.\n“I want young people to be involved in Japan, they don’t know why Japan came. They only know the country. They’ve been living there for centuries,” Oda said at the time.\nLion water rescue: Ratgy’s fiesta\nTokyo\'s tramroad also turned out to be a touchstone of cultural identity.\nDuring the Second World War, before Japanese imperial rule, Japan\'s first tramway was situated between the eastern cities of Tokyo and Amagio.\nIt was very popular for Japan\'s cyclists, who could fit in the huge facilities and stations that used to be iron houses and warehouses.\nInside the airport was a tram center, where Japanese men were given large bags to give to their elderly citizens.\nAnd more than once in the 20th century, workers have cleaned the crowds\' cities of scant bits of rubbish to eliminate the unintentional firewood, which eventually ended up in the water catchment.\nBut just three weeks ago, after a long, successful campaign to clean Tokyo\'s streets and parks, the mayor apologized to rail riders.\nAusterity deal: Take the Drink\nWhen Japanese cars don\'t have work delivered, they come with tax on a number of items.\nNearly 17,000 kilos of beer came from 41 breweries in the past year.\n“Japan Is Doing Better,” read the headline on a front page of an online news website this month.\nIndonesia and Thailand are thought to be among the best examples of raw sewage treatment, and Japan used to clean out its streets about once a year.\nBut the future isn\'t fully changing much.\nA trend in Japan to go for higher electricity costs is already turning out to be very popular.\nChina, China\'s biggest beer producer, is planning to stop importing beer from Japan in 2020.\nAnd like most good Japanese cars, there\'s a local energy drink made from polyethylene bottles that contains nuclear material that\'s involved in the manufacture of nuclear reactors.\n']"
759,Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing: Welcome to the world's wildest intersection,"['A bumpkin from the boundary line of the road was short-circuited by a steamroller on a busy metro track, while his bike was slamming against him — and then o.m., he realized that he was too scared to leave it. Suddenly, a stream of people barged in for the last straw and tossed down on him. At first, he thought, the folk who, at 5 feet 8 inches, had created such a remarkable intersection with so many people were crazy and chaotic. But his driver saw it for the first time just before leaving the highway. Oh, the danger. The man, who has not yet been identified, could have easily been rushed back.\nBut he saw the very thing that drove him crazy: the speed, the subtleties. The distance between the crossing point and the one that bends over backwards, crossing side by side, reaching a steep gradient and giving just the right ""lumbar bump"" so that it fits well on the transverse tracks connecting the two areas. It seemed like an impossible kind of elevation change, so that people who\'d never made the crossing would sense a major curve on the long slippery mountain-hanging that slowly seals off the route. But the crossing completed by a 1.1 miles of track marked by piles of springs produced the essential stabilizing force known as intertilt technology.\nCrossing it was an accomplishment of human heroism, but that wasn\'t the thing the crossroads experience was: It was a thick line of possibilities, every possible turn and every sideways bend.\nLike us, though, trains, cruise cars, tiny planes and tourists everywhere, those involved took extra care to blend into the view of the crowd. But in Japan it is also highly technical, like anything in show business, like dance. The reverse, the more functional, is ideal for craftsmen and painters, though there is a little odd gay area on the line to cater to frights.\nFlying planes and taxis do not start on the second line, due to the fear of an accident. But left-way passengers can explore their favorite spots with the permission of the guest. It was quite spectacular for pilots in Paris and Barcelona.\nOthers, though, feel betrayed. In the eyes of the nearly 1,000 passengers whose job it is to keep the world safe, a giant flying trike sent by the airport airport budget to Japan remains abominable.\nTop air travelers\' have not taken this expressway too seriously. It is one of the busiest cities in Japan, in some cases out of reach of public transit, except for the very wealthy. Manned travelers tend to use the street corners of Tokyo to avoid crossroads, the road for which they then let tourists along in places like a provincial thoroughfare in Tohoku. For 100 billion yen, visiting the Tokyo International Airport is the most popular stop on our list for large empty-city travelers, though there is currently no easy way to drive down the atoll.\nSome passengers who made the journey up the Shibuya crossing were young lovers or pets, but no particular attraction was about to be found. The road was filled with more than two-dozen hulking planes of sun-baked wooden creatures and bulky cargo on the treads.\nOf course, one can avoid all the madness — and above all, no big mistake. A speed-limit sign is installed at the every-other-late-night zone from 1 p.m. to 4 a.m. and nothing has changed; by 7 p.m., the 90-minute ride from Tokyo to Makaha, take half a hour before you run out of fuel and no cars nearby, as the driver exits and conducts another 180-minute, back-up routine in which you run from the counter to the terminal.\nThis saga started with a sleepy bit of snow, then a tango with an excitable passenger caught on what no one would doubt be a first wave of ""monkey pastures"" as they take off across the runway from the airport. Not many dared not venture out again, but all it would take is one visit to my aunt\'s shop, Boke, in the middle of the airport and there\'s plenty to do with Japanese consumers.\n']"

A mecca of architecture, these are the offices of the Yasukuni Shrine, charged by Japanese as “sacred because they were condemned to death during the genocide of Japanese imperial-men”. Each of these avenues are furnished with wooden tarpaulins representing the shrine: orange walls, catlamps and paintings. Each leaves a marked reminder of a historical moment – like tsaba, a Zen poet who died in Japan at the age of 10 in 1896. During the Japanese occupation of the country in 1910, most of the Japanese mistreated, and sought the natural beauty of Yasukuni Shrine. In this luxury black alleyway, the mochi, fruit and bananas with flowers surrounding them stand out like mere empty depots. The Japanese War Museum, the Japanese Cultural Institute and the the Japanese Red Cross are just some of the venues where those with a passing interest in the history of the war call to admire the long and painful war: “The madness of the war lasted for 48 years and it revealed the absurdity of life.” Signage features such historical references as the long list of “bomber submarines” – if you don’t want to waste time riding them through the hellhole – and the global media it has become – such as the interview with Tsunami survivors in a country where it’s hard to estimate exactly how many lives were lost.\nIt’s a mixed bag, but now it’s paying off. Starting to age, the Shrine’s private collection is generating a forward momentum. Rebuffed by all Japanese, Yasukuni is to be revealed again for the first time, on April 8th. A third statue to the Russian imperial-men, mochi, is coming down here on Thursday.\n']"

One can even see that other related images, the burglary of the bank and arson in a town called Sarasota, were carried out using cartoon figures, created by writer/director Richard Grace.\nOne assumes that despite its bravado, the film is shot in places where cinema is clearly from, in which there are consequences, such as the melodrama of Union Jack hats, by the movie novices.\nAs long as the film exists, I do not mind the porno style but cherish the chance to love the real stuff.\n']"
762,"7 reasons to visit Hoi An, one of Vietnam's most beautiful towns","[""Hi An, Vietnam's most beautiful border city is located in both San Andalucía - where you can ride bicycles to every corner of town - and Duong - where your body can take in 6,000 city buildings and thousands of monuments, including the much lauded Hoi An Cathedral.\nThe central city also hosts the Marriott Hotel the huge year after its infamous lawsuit that was eventually settled with about a million Vietnamese.\n1. Hoi An is quieter than the local Chelyabinsk City. The city's streets aren't so loud with the occasional rock blasting and loud drums pounding beats of very loud type music, but you can still see black metal or grunts of little fish ranging from some of Vietnam's largest trucks to the more luxurious State Saloon streetcars.\n2. It's easy to get the impression Hoi An is a cozy country village. Even with the predominantly open floor plan and moderate travel, the area lacks the many food options on offer in more standard cities like Tien Po province, which is pretty hard to find in Vietnam. But that's changing, as the sun sets and you need a car for a lot of downtown southerly travel.\n3. Seven of the city's 33 bridges are pretty simple to navigate to get to Hoi An. The Metro lanes of Duong, Duong, and Hoi An are well preserved, as is Duong Dong - the simple compass links the two. The seemingly unchanged route makes for a charming little city made of the highest quality roads in the world.\n4. The Saigon Bridge might be the best wooden bridge in the world because it is greatly better shape than many others. The Saigon Cross has two lanes of five bridges, called Baumes, which tell you everything there is to know about the Saigon/Saigon border. The Baumes bridge has four wheels that can be installed on the bridge, which is virtually the same length as a central or third lane on a major bridge.\n5. Walk outside during rush hour if you don't want to be stuck in traffic. Trucks and trucks coming from other parts of Vietnam often combine to make this a trip to take. The route has a long track of double car tracks, so it can be a pretty frustrating sight if you miss your other group to reach the route.\n6. Vietnam is incredibly modern. Considering how much time you've been spending in the city, you probably won't find cities as breathtaking as Hoi An.\n7. In the summer the summers are warm. Leave room for change in the park where two-by-fours are paved streets, or in the months when the metro lines snake through Po Khai. Between these, you can easily see the sky that runs from Hoi An to Duong.

764,Pornhub offers quarantined Italians free access,"['The creators of Pornhub in Italy, Italy, on Monday released a website allowing anyone to spy on kids and adults while free to view porn on computers and cell phones.\nThe idea is to identify the exact location of the adult film footage in which the porn site users can watch children and adults being watched in a moment of sexual freedom and anonymity.\n“I like the idea of films directed at children,” Pornhub’s director Giulio Conti told CNN on Monday. “When it comes to Chinese men wanting to kiss girls, it’s against the law.”\nConti said he is very excited about Pornhub’s move to free online viewing for adults, both in Italy and around the world.\n“I think it’s a good idea in Italy as well because it’s an ordinary Internet no-no,” he said. “There are too many (children) here illegally and there is in the market for some pornographic content and that’s one of the areas in which Pornhub gives its research services.”\nThe “sex child” feature has been on the site for two years now, Conti said. In 2008, Pornhub was launched and for two years it is the main porn service to draw porn users to the website, the French website Société d’environnement said at the time.\nMore than half a million people have used the site to livestream their sexual encounters via adult film, mass media and video, including the “Together” soap opera aired on French public television last year, a source of popular fascination for women growing up online.\nThe website also comes with two special filters that allows users to watch shows their friends are watching from a different channel within their browser than they see on television, Vice Magazine reported.\nIf people use the website, videos can be viewed on a mobile phone, computer or computer monitor or they can be shared with friends and family.\nWhat Can We Do About Porn?\nWhile Pornhub’s move could cause controversy in Italy, which has traditionally been a more libertarian country, other app makers are also claiming the site is aimed at drawing new users.\nReddit, the social-networking website, is letting people view porn from two different phones, avoiding the several times those smartphone users can watch the right side of their screen, Latisse Press reported last year.\nWhile porn is free to download, it is only available to kids and adults, and not to adults.\n“If you’re willing to pay, if you want to download porn or if you want to watch the videos on your phone, you can check out the Pornhub app, but not vice versa,” Pornhub’s chief executive Guido Bogada told TechCrunch.\nBut the site’s creators are taking issues they might have raised with French pedophilia legislation – and using it to hit porn supporters.\nThe “Together” soap opera aired in French public television last year, which is not permissible in Italy. Similarly, gay and straight internet users in Portugal’s pro-LGBT Ministry of Defense have claimed to have had “60-’80s” sex sessions featuring heterosexual men.\nMexican movie producer Luis Garza, whose group Cadet for Prudent has operated porn sites, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\nConti, however, said porn providers are trying to recruit new subscribers from the United States, where the company has offices.\n“There are many Americans who do not live in the United States and want to visit Pornhub,” he said. “We really want people to go there.”\n']"

During that time, the “krakothem” — the ethnic Polish people and Roma families — gained more strength than the “light would butchers”. When the bulldozers were removed from the streets, their knaves were replaced by guardsmen and walking stock.\n“The majority of the people of Poland were Kosroks when the war broke out and they would stay put until death,” says van Groeningen. “In fact, at one point we had 800,000 people come and eat our bread. The Serbian Jews will serve their food at the end of the war. We are very lucky to have survived this time.”\nRelated: Interview With Sue Paris: Her Depression-Severe Depression and Werner Herzog’s Hollywood Post-Death Trio\nCared for by pain was at the core of the life of the family.

An entire village had been destroyed and the leaders of Warsaw ceased to exist, leaving them to live with nothing.\nAfter searching through Belgium and collecting the large number of documents that once united the three families, they ended up in France. During this time there was always a special place in St. Pancras for persecuted groups.

770,US cities are losing 36 million trees a year. Here's why it matters and how you can stop it,"['Explain how and where is too expensive to spend on trees and really complain about “being shortsighted?”\nCalls from environmentalists have jumped onto the debate over where the trees are coming from. Early this year, the US government announced several bird-friendly measures that aim to reduce trees that drift on land, such as clearing up trees that overgrowth, interfering with traffic patterns, environmental problems and wildlife. It’s an interesting line of action because most greenbacks have died off in recent years thanks to very different factors.\nFirst, it’s about trees. Right now, US cities are losing one-third of their trees each year due to growing vegetation, environmental concerns, human activity, and their overwhelming natural resources. These chemicals, biological agents, and the like can change the shape and fabric of life.\nIn other words, during the past eight years, the US has lost one-third of its trees and tree fibers. If you want to fight back, make sure you clean up all the garbage in your neighborhood every year, or otherwise knock trees down.\nSecond, of course, if you’re a homeowner or business, don’t go for waste-buying schemes like planting trees. If you’re trying to buy some down payment for a house or even your town’s park, and you make a bid for somebody other than someone, you won’t get everything in return.\nGet out of this housing game, America’s city-by-city map is a website, and it also lists communities that offer practical ways to stop trees.\nThat’s right, life in your neighborhood is over. This means you, as a homeowner, don’t have to constantly hunt for alternatives to grow trees wherever it happens, so for each new tree planted, you’ll get all the varieties you’re looking for. As I said, try to brush up on a new, new landscaping and design to trim down trees if you can.\nThird, keep outside. Outside, with so many permaculture projects and greenfield projects on the agenda, most people can’t imagine losing their forest shrubs, which are often larger than human lifespan and get many larger steps.\nSo actually getting rid of trees is better than losing too many.\nThere are a number of ways in which removing trees is more environmentally friendly than burning them or logging by plants you don’t like. Most are equally rewarding: removing silt and snowmelt in your backyard and soaking up as much snow as possible as long as possible. Putting soil to the ground and water to the soil, instead of just planting the soil, is a good thing that many companies already do.\nWith trees, you avoid having to worry about what the future will hold, or about encountering one more tree after you leave. But the longer that trees still come out of the ground, the harder it will be to get them out. With a fire, the tree has nowhere to go. Then I like to use some as an example.\nAnd as one of my great squirrel friends taught me, burning the snowmelt not only makes the tree more threatening, but even lands a leg above the tree without the hole.\nFor the hound, however, forest shrubs attract a particularly good environmental threat. The fragmentation of spring-sized chunks of wood and stream nutrients, perchlorate-anxious soil, sediment encroachment, and air pollution is among the things that kill houndbees. On the other hand, the best short-lived conservation species can be put to good use.\nKathy McKinnon is the Assistant Professor of Zoology at the University of Arizona.

772,Climate change: How rich people could help save the planet,"['Unfortunately, we are paying double the nominal tax rate to cover climate change. Some rich, including many in our own fossil fuel industry, can indeed pay more than others.\nThis increases the life cycle of fossil fuels and diminishes the amount of carbon that can be avoided or reduced.\nMeanwhile, almost all large-scale sources of greenhouse gases like oil, coal, and natural gas can be eliminated in rapid decline.\nRELATED: Climate change war intensifies – and still hitting harder, faster\nDuring a presentation this week on the matter, the Boston Institute for Advanced Study’s Nathan A. Muckenfuss said that such reductions could result in a reduction in the world’s forests of 82.9 billion acres by 2030.\nThat sounds like a lot. But that’s like saying it would affect all of humanity by 2050. Because it would mean a total loss of over 11 billion acres.\nNow if you’re a 95-year-old computer geek, you’re wondering, “Is this the most distressing threat to our planet?”\nLike life on Earth today, this threat is all about seeing a bigger planet.\nThis might not sound like you want to listen to as much as you can but it is serious. And it’s true. If the continued dominance of fossil fuels is keeping us from seeing that larger, wider universe where we live, we will be living dangerously.\nBecause it is happening, if the situation is reversed, mankind will emit 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide and endanger nearly 7 billion people’s planet.\nSo we will die the planet before the long term impact hits.\nIf things keep getting worse, you might see a few deaths from here and there. The culprit will be climate change.\nWhen you make a deal to become more responsible about climate change, think of previous false prophets and disaster scenarios like the U.S. and Canada putting in action to slow the emissions of toxic gases and prevent another catastrophic climate event like the one in 1950.\nWe live in an era of extreme weather events, extreme poverty, extreme environmental degradation, and catastrophic human health impacts.\nAnd we all know that if we weren’t paying more for carbon-free energy, there would be less need for fossil fuels for energy, taxes, and financing.\nAdvertisement\nAnd since the role of fossil fuels and solar energy is not sustainable, the danger is that the remaining fossil fuel fields may get sidelined by political, economic, military, and military leaders in Washington, D.C. and elsewhere.\nClimate scientists warn that if carbon prices continue to rise at the current rates, it could be well before we get comfortable with carbon emissions growth.\nWhile this is uncertain, our decisions on how to prevent climate change will almost certainly be dictated by what’s best for the environment and our economy.\nRELATED: How the world’s blackest city could spark a revolt\nAnd we will need a humanitarian community, part of an ever expanding transnational cohort, that fosters a level of understanding and will come to see this game in all its forms.\nThe World Wildlife Fund recently concluded that the development of these groups could save 29 billion tons of CO2 – and trillions of dollars.\nThis includes millions of people, which would save more than $1 trillion annually and lead to a reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions globally.\nOur environmental agenda could also change in the process, by getting governments to better understand how to tackle climate change more effectively, collectively and collectively.\nThe global effort for action toward climate change that has taken place has yielded results. Climate denialism and global politics are being weakened and replaced by the ideology of “conscience vs. rationality.”\nAll of this is happening not just in rich countries but in large, developed markets.\nIt’s true that the U.S. military is not the world’s only customer, but there are some smaller and smaller economies which can provide the technological and commercial support needed to mobilize coal, oil, and natural gas.\nGovernments in both Europe and the U.S. need to have their own coal and oil fields to support them.\nThese would enable an advanced corporate-owned model that will lessen, block, and ultimately kill the fossil fuel industry.\n']"

I think of them on behalf of the entire Jewish community. They’re standing there in the Jewish realm, protecting us all as we stand, taking us seriously and ready to answer the call of our faith in Jesus Christ, and at the same time fighting against an evil in all its manifestations.\n2. Be sensitive to the content\nThe focus on Jews and Jewry today has fallen on the majority. According to S.J. estimates, the population is about 36 million. They are among the largest European-American Jewish communities. Many are more devout than Muslims or Christians and more religious than Jews, although they have tended to vary in their observance.\nI find it troubling that in the wake of the events of the past few years, it would be inappropriate to use the phenomenon of Jews and Jews being out in the open for attention and “targeting” as if it were some sort of target practice.\nRather, I find it troubling that such attack would be directed at Jews as a vital national constituency in the U.S. and against whom it seems credible to target Israeli Jews, many of whom would call the “Israeli”s” Jerusalem the “Zionist” of choice, or even ethnically Arab Israelis.\nI would like to see an effort to stop these attacks on Israelis. This may be my opinion in response to President Trump’s attacks on Israeli settlements, continued missile strikes on Syria’s chemical weapons sites, and denial of assurances by its prime minister that negotiations are serious and feasible.\nI hope that more people across the world, especially the Israeli public, would join this movement. And, surely, more of these Palestinians will join.\n3. Respect the status quo\nOne of the great prophecies of Judaism is the outcome of the people of Israel turning against the oppressors, who had promised to rule over them as long as these oppressors remained in power, and what the Israel government had become over these people.\nI believe the overwhelming majority of Jews are in full compliance with this belief. Now it would be appropriate and reasonable to consider how do we best to protect them – a certain level of tolerance will be the greatest for Judaism in many parts of the world, but also in many other parts of the world.\nI encourage those who want to talk to me on this and have more detailed information on each area of Judaism in the United States, and elsewhere. Because I want to offer counsel not just to those who care but also to those who have spoken.\nThese are true beliefs and ideas and']"

The suit is a life-sized replica of a used hazmat suit in 2000, and a reasonable return ticket to their tour stops in California, England and the Middle East.\nCampbell goes on to greet passengers upon disembarking, and during a flight to DC on Friday, the Oscar-winning star appears to have ill-timed a moment of self-defense.\nAmong the passengers, left, is Humberto Ramos, who says Campbell didn\'t even bring out the hazmat suit with her. He also explains that Campbell wore the suit for his flight to London because she\'s a big supporter of his cause. Campbell and Ramos also did not attend the launch of Campbell\'s new Tipping point charity campaign, with the actress and the three other passengers sharing a Twitter picture of a dressing room.\nCampbell said through a spokesperson that she donates clothing and jewelry after a successful run in beachwear.\n""Since my role in the second season of Netflix\'s \'House of Cards,\' which premiered on Netflix back in March, I\'ve seen a pretty dramatic rise in my sales.

777,Tourists being kept under coronavirus quarantine at luxury Maldives resort,"['PYUNE, Sri Lanka (CNN) — Nothing has ever been written about the Zika virus in the Maldives, its coastal heartland. But there has been a consistent message from the conservative government: Not only is the virus dangerous to pregnant women, it can also cause birth defects and brain damage.\nAs the country’s premier tourism destination, the presidential palace is the absolute biggest of the island’s fourteen luxury resorts, complete with restaurants, serviced apartment buildings, and a popular swimming pool. Visitors spend around 80% of their time outdoors, hiking and other pursuits.\nToufaine C. Babbin, a school teacher from a traditional Tamil background, who immigrated to the island in 2005, recalled his first interest in tropical nations: “Traveled on tropical islands. We would often visit the planetarium.”\nAn Austrian student, he was looking forward to a Chilean visit that would give him insights into the Caribbean economy that’s flourishing. “For me the most important thing was to learn about tourism in a way that would be helpful to begin with,” he explained.\nInitially he joined the government’s health team, headed by Chief Minister, Ayub S. Dharmendraendra: “The task was to announce the arrival of the aid funds into the islands and set up a facility where the money could be used for the education of the 15 million people in the country.”\nBut just as the Tamil public (population 22 million) was turning from the tourists to the locals, the government also established a strict administrative system designed to implement a few of the themes he outlined in 2015.\nThat includes handling emergencies and communicating with the international community. To do this, the government decided to take a “more primitive approach to relations with the nations of the peninsula,” according to Cabbin.\n“I get the impression that they are the enemy of the Maldives,” he said. “They try to kill us by criminalizing us but we try to stop it. We are one of the islands that has been kinder to the world, more welcoming, but still they say they have not eradicated the mosquito-borne Zika virus. It can be transmitted through direct contact with the body, without even noticing, without having borne Zika or not showing the symptoms.”\nKrishan Mendio’s office is accessible for most tourists, however those needing relief or emergency aid for urgent cases can take online assistance via xu1 (a relief specialist named with a large laptop laptop) for up to US$70. While in office, Mendio also fielded questions from journalists and students about Zika concerns.\n“I find it immensely difficult, my own personal pain, to access services,” he said.\nA small press centre of six feet tall and 200 metres wide, the premier’s office is equipped with a large 18-inch laptop, desk, mouse, tablets, and a microphone.\nThat means different answers. “Once I ask them to look for my constituency, they just say, ‘Please do not attack us,’” Mendio said. “It’s a lot more flattering in my eyes. The current administration has not taken care of that, they assume I am [losing favor]. They want people to come over here and pull up their phones. But they know they are overstaffed.”\n']"
778,Why the last man standing on the coronavirus cruise ship never gave up,"['The last known human run-in with the death of a cruise ship passenger may have been on an ornamental paper plane.\nFormer cruise ship attendants said they lost control of their stricken avian pilot\'s helmet on the small Caribbean island of Yantai last Thursday, March 28, after his helmet became hard to wear.\nThe passengers had endured a series of high-profile cancellations and accidents for the iconic Saguenay Amatadus sailing in November, 2005 to Haiti for a 579-day trip. The boats were heading from Tiber City, Lima, Peru, to the popular town of Umeria, in the Dominican Republic, on the way to the island\'s Caribbean enclave.\n""It was a ... thoroughfare, very scenic, and they had a lot of family,"" one passenger told CNN. ""And they had a couple of front desk staff. To be honest, we didn\'t have time to put our tickets together and stuff like that.""\nCorruption is endemic in the Caribbean island nation and still people often complain of mistreatment.\nOn Wednesday, an Italian passenger from Texas made similar allegations of flight crew poisoning on the boat, causing 100 passengers to lose consciousness. The passenger, who lives in Tel Aviv, said the operation disrupted her crew members, who were vomiting in apparent cardiac arrest.\nCorruption related to the falsification of passports\nThe lead author of the report, dentist Dr. Rob Schiff, then worked as a medical journalist and orthopaedic surgeon in Berlin before returning to the United States. Dr. Schiff initially worked on the emergency operations operations for the luxury liner, Eva Sednaoui, according to US Navy records.\nLater, he joined a project at the US Naval War College to analyze old documents in order to arrive at the right answer, Dr. Schiff said. The team found that the document was ""certainly not FAILED.""\nShortly after the ship was initially searched in Romania, some experts became distressed by the heavy smell of rotting flesh.\nThe ship started showing signs of water poisoning after a traveler in the opposite boat vomited on vomit left on the autopilot, apparently about five hours into the voyage, the Italian report stated. The sickness was believed to be due to ""ripping flesh of norovirus,"" or lesions on the limbs, or ingestion of antibiotics when vomiting, the initial report said.\n""The mixing of skin inflammations with rat or another organism is a common pesticide,"" it said. ""The transmission of poison against an organ-related organism is caused by the gene duomorph.""\nThe pattern between humans and coronavirus experts also changed, the Italian report continued.\n""The hygiene of traveler disembarking in the ship was certainly not FAILED,"" the report said. ""Less concern was the fact that the disembarkation of passengers on the Ainai [faceport] caused a dispatch error, which was never corrected until it was misidentified as the Saligariena after their onboard adjustment time.""\nDr. Schiff also looked into the possibility that the captain was sick from an infectious disease, not a fraudulent case of the norovirus.\n""I believe the charter company used white passengers\' names to sign their flight registration,"" he said. ""We know which kabob carryout they were flying.""\nHowever, his analysis did not directly link the specific case of the norovirus to the second ship. Nor did he identify the relative owners of the VIP tickets in question, which he discovered were 759 of the ship\'s passengers.\n""The dive of the very last passenger in the Spinosauris had created a great deal of skepticism amongst cruise passengers,"" Dr. Schiff said. ""So you\'ve got zero chance of it occurring in the Seau,"" or one of the three other lock-down ships in the group, according to his analysis.\n""Had the passengers been aware of the coincidences and were present to take appropriate precautions, their behavior wouldn\'t have played a role.""\nNo formal inspection had been conducted of the ship\'s crew on the day of the fateful voyage, according to the Italian report. The ship has since confirmed that it was asked to pay to repair the last person on board.\n""When we went out that morning, we did give ourselves a full inspection, and the next day all those passengers were satisfied,"" US Navy documents say.\n']"
779,The tourism legacy of the Olympic Games,"['LAHORE: The Olympic games are incredible. They also represent one of Pakistan’s most crucial cultural moments, leaving a deep imprint on the nation.\nIn 1964, the first Winter Olympics opened in Beijing – where athletes and officials spent an exhilarating hour on the black-and-blue red pitch – and held for 17 months, with the 1932 Olympics ending in Brazil.\nWhen World War II broke out in Japan and Poland in 1945, the United States was thrust into a war that was not due to be fought, but rather focused on the cultural and educational landscape of its own South American colony.\nDuring this period, the two countries relied heavily on the Lunar New Year (UNINTH) holiday, and the Lunar New Year celebrations, often managed to confine themselves to San Francisco as it happened in Shanghai and Paris.\nThe three-day long UNINTH festival, especially during the winter months, brought the country together.\nAll of this with the help of China, where the Lunar New Year clock is calculated after the event is run and forgotten.\nAccording to an official, UNINTH did not reach every household in Pakistan in 1964 because that would have banned the holiday. The actual results, in an opinion piece in the Pakistani newspaper Wazir, are questionable.\nWazir’s opinion piece stated that the Chinese regime did not have the constitutional right to approve holidays and celebrations that were planned and executed by the UN in 1964, for fear of upsetting the sensibilities of its neighbours.\nPakistan’s constitution, according to Wazir, stipulates, “Public holidays cannot be granted without reason, and some restrictions are unnecessary…”\nMuch of the UNINTH is purely coincidental, according to Wazir. The UN was founded in 1934 when Nawaz Sharif joined Pakistan on a visit to the US. In 1979 he held a cabinet meeting. “The Council of Ministers published a draft charter eight years later to launch a long-planned truce between Pakistan and the US,” he said.\nPakistan’s prime minister Ali Zeidan hosted an in-kind fundraiser in Washington on 18 November 1979 to “issue recognition of independence”. Zeidan was awarded the “World Heart, Citizenship and Development Award” in 2010.\nAfter independence, the People’s Republic of China signed an association agreement with Pakistan; an official of the Chinese embassy in Pakistan hailed Zeidan as one of the leaders of this movement, thanks to a posting with Pakistan Peoples Party PPP and later the Congress Party.\nThe China’s embassy in Pakistan said the commitment, “we consider Pakistan’s historic presence and historic contributions to the promotion of democracy and culture in the Asia-Pacific region”.\n']"

Well, there’s reason to celebrate! Preparing for school is all about learning.\nIf you’re listening to the “90% of the times are good,” you know that you are better off not spending time with your child or watching TV so you can help them through a difficult time.\nOur oldest kid, Daniel, is ready for school. He’s already mastered hundreds of subtle skills. He is determined to be a fine student because he understands how to deliver a good education.\nWhen school gets tough these days, Daniel is a double joy, excited and fulfilled to be in the special department, enjoying his special gifts — cookies, chocolate candy, coffee — and obviously (wouldn’t you believe it, Daniel?) happy that he knows how to cope.\nBut Daniel’s also learned to appreciate the value of food, especially beans, and the taste of what he eats every day. And so, when Daniel arrives at school, he’s shocked at the things he eats every day.\nEarly in the morning, Daniel said, he’ll eat several pita slices and then squeeze them out of the oven. This technique is so cool that when Daniel finds his secret, he anticipates the desserts being freshly prepared with it on.\nDaniel gives his favorite cup to a child of his age, and asks him what he likes best about what he’s eating. At the end of the morning, the chocolate treats are handed out to everyone.\nToday, Daniel starts early for school, before he starts high school. He takes lessons to study materials and read to make sure he has the knowledge he needs to be successful in school.\nIf Daniel’s single-minded, it also is rewarding to have someone like him get to share his meal with his peers, as every so often someone else is there to give everyone a treat.\nWhen Daniel enters college, he will have access to a brand new basement cafeteria in Williamsburg. And he won’t be able to enjoy the best cafeteria food available in the College of William and Mary’s built-in 15,000 square foot area. It will be a vibrant environment, no matter the size of the kitchen.\nSo of course, Daniel is excited to get involved in the next phase of the culinary career.\nSo, do this time around and purchase a “for sale” account. If you’re interested in buying, then sell it and welcome to the gift shop. No matter how slight your son is going to be, please keep this in mind.\nPlease help Daniel. If not already, give this a try.\n']"

783,How this outbreak is adding to the risk of miscalculation between global enemies,"['By Alexander Ramsey\nApril 5, 2015\nThe 23rd General Authority of the United Nations has begun launching a global plan to combat miscalculation. The plan was designed to open up possibilities within the intergovernmental organizations and within their internal mechanisms, such as bilateral, multilateral agreements that undermine peacekeeping efforts in or outside the region. The plan will develop special measures to counteract internal miscalculations in the Security Council. Experts believe that the plan could slow down the rising threat of internal miscalculation.\nA widely respected U.N. expert, David Addington, has said that central stability and continuity of an American presidency could be tested at any time. Addington is set to appear on the UNT directorate panel as a member of the UN legal committee (the UN Criminal Code). Members of the Presidential Advisory Council on Foreign Relations, the U.S. State Department’s strategic counsel, and others discuss the role of the Security Council in any crisis in any context.\nThis brings us to the alarming dynamics within this crisis. To protect an organ against internal miscalculation, we must defeat external miscalculations. Although external miscalculations occur frequently, it is mainly in developed countries that tend to avoid taking the extra step of looking at the public balance in understanding internal miscalculations and an ad hoc policy toward this trend. The panel itself has a very rigid role, however, as the governments we are supposed to represent are judged on their value. They regard outsiders with special protection, often in the form of role models, to avoid the internal incidents that could cast the region and its oversight mechanisms as a complete failure.\nThe internal miscalculation within the Security Council is neither the end of instability in the Middle East nor the beginning of a new crisis. Resurgence of destabilization in the world’s major industrial economies is possible. China is likely to be the major influence in causing the problems of the region, and Iran, likely to continue its influence in the world economy, is likely to be the main influence in achieving this, either by facilitating new alliances or funding them.\nWe must limit the use of external miscalculations, have more bilateral and multilateral discussions and building more institutional units outside the Security Council to investigate internal miscalculations, to prevent and limit external miscalculations from exacerbating.\nFinally, global organizations should engage in direct dialogue with their respective leaderships, providing them with the tools they need to address external miscalculations, and to equip them with sufficient legal structures to protect from internal miscalculations by responding appropriately to the perceived role they may be responsible for. They must resolve the internal miscalculations if some kind of systemic response is required. Diplomats whose involvement in internal structures has been an issue in the past, however, should take firm action.\nDavid Addington, who is regarded as a master of hybrid diplomacy, is well established in both international and domestic diplomacy. He was the U.S. ambassador to the Council from 2006-2014. (see for an in depth look at the president’s position on the Syria crisis, Syria and Mideast.) He has lectured on international law at more than a dozen foreign and domestic universities.\nAddington has been deeply involved in a broad range of relationships within global organizations, including the Development and Humanitarian Policy Council, the Intergovernmental Council on International Human Rights, and the Future of Missionational Missions. His advice on UNT matters include strengthening and upgrading existing mechanisms to address internal security. Addington is a well-regarded and accomplished person and a strong advocate for human rights.\nMy colleagues on these issues had better hope that New Zealand is not a global leader in this area, when it comes to international efforts to constrain external miscalculations by solving internal miscalculations. Such efforts could curtail the warming of conflict zones, enhance U.S. posture in their midst, and help to create a safe climate for peacekeeping forces in other region.\nT. Simon Bolivar is the Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Aid at the United Nations.

784,Photos: The coronavirus is leaving empty spaces everywhere,"['(CNN) — A coronavirus, from a rare sexually transmitted infection called rompscales that are no more contagious than STDs, now appears to be among the most severe.\nScientists hope the source of the disease can be traced to an underground brothel, a U.S. government scientist told CNN affiliate WSOC.\nOn Monday, it was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that rompscales, which can carry amoebic hypoxia, have infected 24 in 22 states, the CDC reported Monday. More than 30 others have died.\nThat could mean the virus may have missed its usual path, or it could have started infecting people the the virus has not yet previously touched, according to a study published last month in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.\n“The combination of infection with amoebic hypoxia — the loss of cellular activity that drains bodily fluids — and the virus’s passive presence is suggestive of a possible carrier,” Dr. Luis Adrian, a virologist and virologist at Emory University, said in a statement.\nThe highly contagious illness occurs when the body’s immune system clatters down into a maelstrom of viruses and bacteria capable of infecting and killing a person.\nThe most common causes of the virus are transmission of blood-borne thrombocytopenia, the body’s enzyme that stops the clumps from forming normally.\n“This is what started this disease, and we suspect that it started infecting people in different ways,” Dr. Keith Skinner, the CDC’s lead scientist on rompscales, told CNN’s Eric Kyllo.\nAn infected person is completely “completely unresponsive, but can be given medication that increases the body’s overall immunity,” Skinner said.\nThe official cause of the deadly rompscales is unknown.\nMuch of the chlamydia virus that started in 2010 was thought to be behind rompscales’ discovery, but it’s now been linked to cancer, bone marrow disease and other infections, according to the CDC.\nIndividuals who have a cousin in the U.S. or Canada may also be at high risk for the virus, Skinner said.\nThe American Red Cross sent a well-child and pregnant woman from Florida to Atlanta to check on her baby.\nAlthough rompscales are not officially named, American Red Cross spokesman Scott Marshall told CNN affiliate WBZZ-TV that the infection is “explosive”.\n“We think we are seeing the species change so dramatically that maybe we are also seeing the trigger of the timing of this virus,” Marshall said.\nThe CDC said it has been working with other agencies to determine how it might relate to rompscales.\nA preliminary research team led by Albuquerque, New Mexico-based investigators working with U.S. Customs and Border Protection is looking at “cocaine-type pharmaceuticals to treat serious infections, and whether other drugs can be used for more widely understood and management of the type of severe infections we have,” the CDC said.\nThe strain of rompscales also infects humans.\nThe virus is usually discovered in travel-acquired viruses and bacteria, where only tiny trace amounts of the virus have been observed in people. Unlike most colds, which can infect the nervous system and even cause the bite of a baby, rompscales can potentially infect other organ systems including heart, lung and kidney systems.\n']"
785,The week in 38 photos,"['The Fed just announced new policy changes, and that doesn’t mean the economy is back in growth mode. Even more striking is the warning the Fed is putting out in the just-released minutes of its March meeting, which said “the economy is increasingly encouraged by the moderation in labor growth and the increasing use of automation.” This probably reflects the fact that some of the Fed’s increased optimism is mainly a result of uncertainties in the labor market, but also the fact that the various earnings reports are balanced. Even worse, because the Fed has launched a $4.3 trillion asset purchase program and consumer debt now at $4.4 trillion, that program will have negative impacts on the economy. It also impacts the incomes of households (but not the wages of employees) and causes the labor force participation rate (which was around 62.1% in January), which has jumped to 62.3% in February (over all those who worked in January and February).\nThat being said, the Fed’s meetings lately are a little more important. Inflation has been a bit fickle during this downturn, and that also comes from an economy that has weakened for so long that employers feel like they need more workers. In addition, the timing of the various new monthly Fed programs has been very unpredictable. Sometimes they will be beneficial, sometimes they are just unnerving. So even with these twin maneuvers, the Fed has been a little more patient since the beginning of 2018. It needs to repeat how it reacted at the start of the year. It may sound strange to note it now, but since the beginning of 2018 the Fed has sold off tons of dollars. The Fed sold $9.3 trillion of Treasury securities in the first week of January and then $7.7 trillion during the first two weeks of March, in the millions of dollars. In the first six months of 2018, the Fed sold $37.3 trillion, while the Fed sold $37.4 trillion in mortgage securities. In addition, the Fed has been buying $3.2 trillion worth of Treasury securities since July of 2017. The Bernanke Funds, according to the latest Economic Bill Plus Statement (paid to The Washington Post), were worth about $200 billion in March, much of which was used for the Fed’s open-ended Operation Twist.\nThe Fed has said it is ending its program in principle, but they’ve adjusted that up. So far, the policy has been effective in controlling costs and eliminating uncertainty from the market, but they’ve also taken immediate steps to boost inflation. The bigger concern is that next week, the Treasury Department will release the first set of interest rate hikes since the third quarter of 2013, or soon afterward. That’s not likely to change the policy stance of the Fed, but there are some concerns that could be a cause for concern. If the Fed’s policy discussion has been sufficient to prevent some pain, then there could be a bit of a jump in the unemployment rate. The Fed seems more concerned about the possibility of a recession when it released the minutes of the minutes of the March meeting. The likely result from the Fed’s recent statement could be the beginning of a slowdown in growth. This is especially so for big retailers, which are the leading members of the economy this year. Companies like retailers like Macy’s and Kohl’s, aren’t strong enough for Fed policy to be changed.\nLike all observers, I’m also looking ahead to next year’s work being done. So despite all the snags, keep an eye on Consumer Reports, due out in August. This is one of the first articles I’ve seen since I got fed up with the economy and turned to them for advice on how to fix it. So stay with me.\n']"

Then, the New York Times reported Sunday that Russian hackers had hacked U.S. networks to hijack those systems. The Times says the Russians tried to sabotage the November election, too.\n']"

789,March 12 coronavirus news,"['\nCultural experts are reporting that the respiratory infection that is marked as coronavirus as is influenza can live there for 30 years. After the bad weather of the recent past, the coronavirus can return to the public. Until now, coronavirus is managed as a secondary class of illness, experiencing only mild symptoms such as hot or dry cough, fever and swollen toes.\nAs symptoms have worsened since the illness started in 1997, coronavirus infection in humans has spread to many people throughout the globe and in Africa and Asia. At the time the outbreak of the influenza is reported, other types of coronavirus disease, which appear only sporadically, have also spread across borders throughout the world.\nThis year there have been five deaths in the United States of related to coronavirus. Another of those deaths was the fatal case of Michael David Mulcahey, a 33-year-old man who died on Easter morning Feb. 15.\nOur virus is the most common pathogen for which respiratory infections are commonly associated. This spectrum of the virus is sporadic and affects a wide swath of the world, where people may have very cold or flu-like symptoms. The symptoms usually last several days or weeks, and are usually transient and specific to such regions as England and Canada. The disease is primarily transmitted by direct contact with bodily fluids, such as saliva, tongue, skin, eyes, noses and mouth.\nRevere Health Canada announced on Tuesday that he is now swine flu-free, despite this virus still infecting most people. McGill University Health Centre confirms today that he is swine flu-free, however, in a brief post on the organization’s website, Scheuermannia Röttenberg — who handles family preparedness as the family doctor in England — expressed “Thanks to all their cooperation and support.”\nAll infectious diseases have symptoms that last two to five days, as well as a host of potential risks. However, “these symptoms are usually mild and should only strike through open or diarrhea or a rapid-fire chills,” meaning no more than mild illness, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Today’s new coronavirus virus is a variant of the influenza A or B virus.\nIn the United States, Corvus viruses were found in over 1,000 people during 2014 and 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2014, the first world-wide outbreak of the disease was reported, however the CDC revealed that seven countries outside the US were affected and others affected by the disease. By March 2016, the virus had spread westward in 20 more. In response, the U.S. national governments issued flu-preventing posters for individuals between the ages of 25 and 69.\nAccording to Professor Rita Buck of McGill University’s Department of Health Sciences, “Although the first-ever cases of Middle Eastern flu have been recorded in Europe, we are working to put together a worldwide response. A global pandemic is a challenging, but ambitious, task.” She commented that the B strain of coronavirus has been found in South America, India, Russia, and China.\nAlthough the general public has been offered advisories as to the ability to get rid of virus in public with appropriate precautions, health professionals continue to recommend exposure to those who may appear vulnerable to having the virus spread. They are advised to eliminate travel with people who have reported not being able to present with contacts of a confirmed case and to make sure the person has not used any health products in the last six months.\nEducating citizens about the risks associated with contracting the virus and the potential for illness is a critical public health response. A public meeting will be held Tuesday, April 13, at 6:30 pm at the Will Rogers National Museum in Vancouver, B.C.\nAccording to Nurses Canada, among the known severe symptoms of coronavirus in its 24-year history was back-alley disease. The virus requires only some maintenance therapy as an initial source of symptoms. Based on anecdotal information, they believe it may be able to help ease some of those symptoms of the disease.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, Corvus virus “is an especially lethal strain.” Heaps of cases have been reported in parts of Africa and South America. This is the first time coronavirus has caused this kind of type of illness, and it is possible to detect it in humans by ultrasound, CT scan, or a blood test.\n“It is important to be aware of the risk associated with infection with coronavirus,” said Brett Lawson, director of the Infectious Diseases Research Laboratory at McGill University’s Billing']"

791,How religious communities are modifying traditions to prevent coronavirus spread,"['WASHINGTON (CNN) — Religious communities in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are using religious rituals to eradicate coronavirus-carrying sexually transmitted infections and encourage copycat infections and reuse of contaminated organs, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature Medicine.\nThe idea that people living in a congregation of Hindu, Muslim and Buddhist monasteries should develop entire families’ bodies and reputation, scientists say, dates back to the 20th century.\n“Religious communities in Japan are exploring ways to become more inclusive by aligning domestic traditions with current religious practices and approaches and altering existing ritual and restorative practices,” says co-author Nancy Zhou, an associate professor at Monash University and one of the study’s senior authors.\nOlder congregations don’t seem to have joined forces, the authors write, “regardless of whether individual bodies make the recipients feel good.”\nRelated:\nOrgan donations matching up with international aid\nLiberty of ‘Made in America’ art exhibit complete with environmental awards\nEllen Schlossmann, deputy director of the Jandektz Family Research Council, recognizes the work of leading academics in their analysis of religious traditions in Japan and South Korea, which she says are often notoriously quiet and methodical.\nBut Zhou points out that religious leaders do play a role in transparency and non-judgment. In Japan, the kind of social justice activism Zhou ran for the mainstream politician in the 1980s is still culturally important to many different groups.\nRelated: Westerners find it difficult to relate to Japanese\n“As Jews and Japanese Catholics, we have to integrate norms, practices and values,” Zhou says.\nIn the United States, the assumption that people from different faiths live harmoniously throughout their communal and cultural traditions appears to be tied to the ideal of a welcoming society.\nBut in the cases of maverick and transformative leaders from various religions, members and believers are sometimes forgotten because of their little-known history or cultural fit, says Rachel McConchie, emerita professor of religious ethics at Tufts University.\n“It’s important to people to understand how their communities operate and what they want to achieve,” she says.\nIn South Korea, there are efforts to transform communities’ practices, processes and practices, including continuing studies of polytechnic education, as well as churches and other religious institutions for further education and training.\n“They are changing the people they affect,” she says.\nThe opposite is true in Taiwan, where many churches are adopting modern traditions, including the Tenuta word traditional; which to many Buddhist followers have already become, into “Koo Ma Son,” which translated into either Buddhist or Hindu prayer, according to Greer Seederman, Asian adviser at the American Atheists.\n']"

Asked about Italy’s famous “sick letter scandal,” one of Italy’s richest men (some 40 million euros), Mario Monti gave his audience: “Why? When you hear ‘loopholes?’ Why? Why?”\nAlthough Italy has a terrible record of having a free-market economy, one byproduct of Europe’s failure to tolerate the protectionist phase is that it is now increasingly able to accept the unfair increase in the value of the euro by borrowing at high interest rates to fund its huge budget deficits.\nThe limited growth, and the sharp fall in competitiveness, driven partly by the eurozone crisis, is likely to have left Italy saddled with a budget shortfall equivalent to half of the nation’s GDP in just four years, 20 years after all the elites who attended election talks at the time blamed growth for their country’s economic woes.\nIn that period, it has borrowed from the European Central Bank to finance its rapid budget cuts, which have also slowed growth.\nTo ease the fiscal burden, Italy’s Central Bank is increasing interest rates by another 5.8 percent on June 2, almost 3 percentage points higher than what it set aside to buy its bonds in the early years of the euro-era, and more than it will raise every month in its general tax and export sales.\nIf these interest rates are to match those imposed for corporate and municipal bondholders, the economic burden would also spiral out of control.\n']"

795,Fraudsters get hefty prison terms for impersonating French minister,"['PARIS — Hand-wringing abroad is part of a growing trend in which political prosecutions are bringing dubious or family-friendly charges against powerful or self-serving defendants across Europe.\nProsecutors in France have sentenced, acquitted or even brought criminal charges against 15 alleged bank fraudsters over the past year. At least one case involves someone trying to blame those who steal from his or her relatives. And five people are now facing the death penalty for allegedly helping the money-laundering scheme disguised as a French public servant.\nMany of the cases involve that country’s most notorious banker Manuel Valls, who oversaw PIGS Insurance as his Ministry of Social Services, a company he led from 2006 until his death in January 2014.\nAnd unlike France’s Roman Catholic Church, the widely viewed Valls family remains far from conventional politics. It is a blessedly secular France. Members of the Valls family, currently in power, tend to be the most Catholic in the country. One of the brothers who survived the family ouster is the head of the Citroen bank, Leo Bibeau. Two siblings are ex-priestes — his wife told him not to declare his wife’s assets, according to court documents — and two nephews.\nIt’s nothing new. Many people with trusted social contacts also often connected with French jobs on the world’s highest level of state dependency, paying for travel and often sending food.\nYet there’s no reason to think the gangs will protect citizens of a country full of members of the underworld who have fled Haiti over the spring and early summer for Germany and Germany’s northeastern territories.\nThose organized crime syndicates, mostly based in Europe, are using Europe’s best-known identity as the currency for serving their increasing interest in generating the identities of criminal organizations.\nOne industry lobby group blames greedy individuals who send money to political commissars, though the British government said Wednesday it was handling the case of 84 people.\nWhile France has an estimated 5,000 mln euros in account for the criminals seeking to collect their identities, very few find a way to collect them, and it is the perceived instability and integration of families that prosecutors believe poses a danger. Some of the members steal financial information from victims’ bank accounts, and turn credit cards into forged documents, taking hundreds of millions of euros of government receipts from unsuspecting banks, holding business deals for the elite and influencing public discourse in the media.\n“Who is the shadowy figure telling the stories of the operatives the police and judges are scouring for?” asks Frank Piquet, of the Liberal Party, who regularly relies on contacts from the media and has helped the security forces identify small groups of charged suspects.\nThat’s what senior lawyer Amos Mavalomo believes has helped create an increasingly menacing picture of the ultra-conservative Valls family.\nShortly after losing his leadership as finance minister in 2014, Valls ran a family-friendly bank called Valleur. His wife, Isabelle, was appointed on a couple of occasions to the Public Protection Commission (PGC), a job given to politicians and politicians in other positions of power.\nThe prosecution alleges that at least some of Valls’ associates, prosecutors say, used intermediaries to arrange anonymous accounts in France and those of owners of more than 100 international conglomerates.\n“The twisted, twisted truth has been made public,” Poulais said last week.\nMavalomo says most of the plots involved a kind of agent of influence, a person who paid money for something by other means or paid money with government property. He said such people are so exercised with the prestige of having a common clientele that they can now profit by taking advantage of publicity, which can have devastating consequences.\nHe says that, at least, isn’t the case. As in other cases, Valls’ clients can be kept under surveillance as long as they don’t leak their identities or do anything untoward.\nBut some details on the Valls family’s murky business ventures have been deeply muddled, without any official documentation or proof. In one instance, a company that handles transactions to insurance companies helped in the arrest of a German communications expert charged with helping Qatari businessmen obtain top ratings on Emirates Airlines.\nMavalomo says such leaks are not illegal, but “they have many cracks in the concrete.”\n']"

Irving St., Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nShe will be presenting the cautionary tale of how coronavirus can wreak havoc on even tiny creatures.\n""Our dominant cause of coronavirus infection was transmission of the abnormal precursor Bacterium norovirus that is doing havoc on the virus,"" she said. ""By the time we saw this infection spreading so far, we had acquired the world\'s first person first case. Our second victim is now returning to the host, only to be exposed to the virus at the same time as the main cause. An infectious virus that destroys cells, transmits and spreads viruses, spreads very quickly. This is because the virus is spread by a single, broad-organism cell, not a single strand of cells.""\nIn that case, the coronavirus has traveled over the border and isolated enough cells that adults survive for just a few days, then wander off, attacking the rest of the world and killing millions worldwide.\n""The wind blows the virus at the will of the immune system,"" she said. ""The disruption that the virus has caused as it does not infect you or your immune system is very severe. The virus then spreads rapidly to other parts of the body. The body and its immune system loses many immune cells and antibodies -- or good defenses -- that protect its body. This leads to the virus being able to destroy the body and diminish its ability to fight off infection.""\nHer findings are published in New England Journal of Medicine.\nHere\'s what the experts are focusing on:\nTracking the virus once it\'s at a root to start with\nProtecting against the disease early\nProtecting the body from infection early and keep any form of infection as a matter of course\nIf a person has it at any stage in their life and has a clear reason for it\nAvoidant, resistant, and resistramiral infections: Here\'s what the experts are focused on, on the type of infection:\nA main probable cause of the virus\nThe virus is spread by local transmission of virus or other aerosol particles from infected people or pets\nThese aerosol particles, which are usually aerosolized, include aerosols from one end to the other with resistance, and vapor from another end that may include viruses like Bacillus anthracis or Merkel\'s virus.\nBarring these and other potential results, coronavirus infection won\'t spread very far. However, it could take a few days or more. The virus can be transmitted as short-term as a few milliliters of it.\nIf the virus were spread by close relatives, like the human flu and Avian flu (and those associated with both strains), it would be at this stage of the development.\nIt is impossible to predict when people will see disease and have an undetected or extreme reaction. Confirmation of symptoms such as fever and cough could appear between five to seven days after an unusual symptom was diagnosed.\n""HIV has, again, been very damaging to human population in the past,"" Dr. Goyette said. ""HIV has now entered a new phase.""\nDoctors are making some incredible progress in removing the virus from human bodies, and in preventing transmission.\n""Our goal is to prevent transmission and prevent it with other types of vaccines,"" she said. ""But we\'re getting good results -- we just need to keep people informed.""\nFunding for virus safety remains a little fuzzy, though. Right now, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is funding a research effort to develop vaccine formulations based on a whole-genome RNA (MLN) test to improve overall cellular and molecular mapping of viruses.\nThe FDA has been completely focused on this field. According to NIH, one of the things it is trying to do is ramp up funding for field-to-field testing.\nAnd this work is being funded by $90 million that is available for new research. With one million dollars, it\'s no wonder scientists are moving toward increasing funding for novel genetic diagnostics.\n']"

""It\'s no different from a day where we\'re just going to be there or get a coffee and drive all over the place.""\nA king-size bed and chairs\nThe entire farm remains attached to Denny\'s roof, but the décor is really Denny\'s.

802,Why no one is reading your coronavirus emails,"['You want to have a Secret Service buzzer in your room for everyone to listen in and help you if you haven’t made those emails public yet.\nBut no one is either part of an elaborate, complicated, high-tech scheme to alert the public that someone has been sending those risks.\n“It’s a new phenomena,” Aaron Shutfeld, editor in chief of Popular Science at InformationWeek, tells CNN. “This really springs from the idea that many of our everyday interactions are having very different financial implications.”\nWhy do we talk about potential risks, such as how much money is left over after a deal is reached with a corporation that might have made a single error?\n“We don’t have time to revisit this,” Shutfeld says. “It doesn’t take you long to realize that we are really trying to hide things from our friends and family.”\nIn fact, the systems to alert people of high-risk or dangerous situations that become public have been developed by software programmers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Google.\nThe new systems allow anyone to use a Secret Service app, calls to the IRS, messages to Congress or other public accounts such as those personal financial records of people in the news, and a “watch” app to help them understand and handle what’s happening in the news.\nOf course, the security argument to push out new alerts is complicated.\n“I think that’s still a relatively complicated task,” Shutfeld says. “It’s actually a very different exercise from one in the past, where you had to become more user-friendly and be able to go back and take notes.”\nPrivacy advocates who have long sought an information storage system that would be more open to inquiry, like a Wikipedia check-in or browsing history, have found the programs aren’t likely to be successful for fear of being used to leak information even from government records.\nCory Gulling, senior policy analyst at the nonprofit Consumer Watchdog, is already pushing for more privacy protections.\n“There is an old saying: the last one is always upon us,” he says. “It’s important that people remain hopeful about privacy and those that they trust are well informed and objective.”\nPrivacy advocates argued for a system that would help determine when a person is potentially exposed and what can be done about them.\n“I would hope that everyone should have a really robust and effective warning system that will be embedded into their personal email,” Susan Paulo, program manager of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s public affairs department, tells CNN.\nIt’s not just that the new, lower-level alerts could be less intrusive.\n“These alerts, basically requiring the user to have an identification number that the recipient is agreeing to, I think, could address some of the problems that we currently have with government programs,” Gulling says.\n']"

Things rarely end the way you think they’ll.\nNow that the NBA has lost two of its best coaches in recent memory, who has publicly supported Krzyzewski’s job running the team? A longtime gentleman who listened to his players and served his family on the floor and in the stands.

He cited a 2008 court decision to correct Justice Department misgivings about raising the price of a small burst copper mine through price shocks.\nAlthough taxes are included in the GDP benefit, the price of copper, often used for mining by the government, was much higher during the Great Recession than it was during the Cold War.\nEven in the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan was sympathetic to attempts to lower prices.\nBiden said he decided to run for the presidential race with his mother’s eye on the polling numbers, not the polls.\nBiden said in a speech earlier this year that he used the health care law to advocate that insurers and employers adjust premiums to the changes they are required to make.\nThe Florida senator spoke on Wednesday to a program of eight or nine community community groups, so that they could better compete with new doctors in the battleground state.\nBiden, who spoke Tuesday at the Glendale Community College, said he was determined to hold up the end-game of the health-care debate at the United States Supreme Court, and won out on the issue.\n“I consider my opponents to be cowards,” Biden said on Wednesday. “They did not believe in the growth of the American economy and they have no interest in fixing it.”\nBiden’s campaign manager said he was proud of Biden and that he “truly believes that the fight is not over.”\n']"
805,Doctor: How to reduce your vulnerability to coronavirus -- when sleeping,"['\nDear Doctor,\nLast month, I had the eye contact that I have never had before. I was so rested, you always know which areas I want to focus on for improved sleep. After a few days, you tell me I don’t sleep in that way; that you wake at 3 in the morning and then get up, then I wake up at 8 in the morning. You say you want to sleep in that way, but in reality, I’ve never slept in that way with any of you.\nMany years ago, I fell asleep in bed and there was no perceptible feeling going on. It was time to open the book on how to sleep in winter. Some scientific study found that women who sleep in “dark” airways lack benefits from an antioxidant, anti-microbial immunity, and anxiety, but their sleep cycles get disrupted and rebound. Those women reported a morning of negativity and habitual snoring. Some studies have indicated the opposite.\nI think she loves you just fine, but I have started to make trouble because the anticipation builds up in the belly, away from your friends and family. On nights when I’m awake and asleep, it gets more intense and overburdens me, and now, sometimes, I get very angry and defensive. I learn to hug you and tell you we have become a little too good at messing with our senses. I now sleep in that airway sitting on the side of your butt, a few inches shorter than before. Sometimes, it’s my body that stops working, so I go to bed expecting to enjoy another evening.\nMy problem at this stage in my life is that I’m not an ideal, non-surgical person, and probably never will be. Now, I have already started working with my husband and children in advanced engineering in the form of my second career, not for the same reason as you, but for a long time. A normal person would be fine with sleeping in airways, but when your husband and kids wake up during the night, they have to go to bed?\nMy wife is a fine actress, but did you guys really take care of your eyes, when your eyes are closed every morning, and when your cheeks are spotless, deep? Do you want to sneak a whiff of your possible sins in your eyes every day, for the rest of your life? Well, not to do that is a pretty big bad bet, especially if you’re looking for a more relaxed, family-oriented sleep.\nI have suggested dieting to help with your weight loss, and though you’re fine, you have not gotten over your body issues and it’s not that easy. Cutting out caffeine — as diet pills do — can help, as are other choices, and as they are relatively affordable. But you’ve talked all the time of knowing, “I want to lose weight,” and “all your tools and weight loss” can do the trick, right? I know it sounds dumb, but I do find that your neck, not your shoulders, are your biggest weaknesses, so it’s really pretty hard for me to pull that off, too.\nI also suggested reducing your natural fats like olive oil and niacin, and making a meal made with organic ingredients, such as chicken liver, mushrooms, and grilled vegetables, which are low in saturated fat. I also ask my wife to make a small bowl of cereal every once in a while. I don’t think she will do this!\nPlease, better sleep and find ways to sleep better.\nI know from the studies we do, that many doctors can tell you about fall-related sleep disorders, but I feel your question is rhetorical. I know there are many ways to help — and there are good ones too.\nThanks for your prayers,\nDr. Kentashita\n']"
806,"It's time to let the experts do their jobs, Mr. President","['By the way, President Donald Trump did something simple when he called cable news a liar — gave the will of a caucus of cable news executives, its independent watchdog, their political bosses, Republicans and Democrats alike, a rooster sandwich and a sandwich of the same type.\nThat’s an insane, rude, obscene and inappropriate act.\nThe watchdog is really the utility of the political staff at NBC News. And they have an ethical code of conduct that they are always at odds with to which they have once again come under fire. This is outrageous.\nI am confident that next year, with the recent disintegration of the presidency, CNN will feel normal and normal. It will be clear to all of us who might otherwise be questioning what these American patriots in NBC News are trying to get out of their fiefdom.\nWhat a load of garbage.\nJeez, what a waste of our time.\nAnd Donald Trump has repeatedly shown himself the ability and his ability to ignore standards and respectfully treat the experts in the newsroom — this administration — as if they had the devil on their backs, becoming the dean of journalists and history books, it would be fools not to act.\nBut each time the speaker of the House or the federal investigators in the Senate or the acting attorney general of the Department of Justice or any of the Trump presidential lackeys make the line about what will happen “if Marco Rubio ends up not running, we’ll all go nuts,” this is the moment to do it, and we are here to support it — actually endorsing it for now.\nWe just can’t see another Republican House member — even the person most people of faith are sadder about — going all the way to Washington.\nWe want our Senate and D.C. Democrats to be represented by a congressman with an ethics issue on their plate, a voice in Washington — think the Republican Majority of the House, Democratic Majority of the Senate — and yet — there’s an excuse for Mr. Trump to call a Republican and say he’s going to end up not running.\nNo, this is totally off-base, but the most frequent excuse for condemnation at the White House is to quote a respected historian.\nAnd so we — let’s not kid ourselves, sorry. It’s almost stupid because we’re in a country that thrives on ignorance.\nIt’s rather interesting to me when a debate show such as “Newsweek” shows only for minutes — even more so that the following would be interesting:\nIn 2006, a host asked President George W. Bush what he thought of Congress and members of his own party in an interview in Chicago. It was Washingtonian style.\nIf it weren’t for he, it wouldn’t be worth much in the stands or on the air. But in 2012 the same debate show, which brought so much drama to an otherwise sunny day, brought a subject whose shortcomings were not excused as an opportunity to flounce the nation with “bombshell” information as we all know it — one deliberately always dodges the need to ask specifically why someone has a hole in their chest and one deliberately slights a joke — the morning after the show that he supposedly grumbled about McCain, even though it had nothing to do with Ukraine.\nAnd then there was the recent TV show, not to call it a show, and no executive ever said something inappropriate about Sen. Susan Collins. This was fascinating, going all the way back to Christopher Dodd, who so assiduously avoided calling an entire episode of “Crossfire” “hyperbole.”\nThey did it with more speechwriter unquenchable fieryness than even Senator Collins could fathom, and even on TV they could give us z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z']"
807,"President Trump, heed these five lessons from my career in disaster response","['During his disastrous first 100 days in office, President Donald Trump has repeatedly called the “rainbow effect” from the hurricane Katrina.\nHis explanation for the damage seems suspect, but at least he offers serious solutions to the mess of people and infrastructure both physically and psychologically damaged by the hurricane.\nNew Orleans residents and tourists who lost their homes when a tornado tore through the city in the middle of September remain recovering from their destruction and potential recovery challenges.\nWhat was lost, they are not.\nWhat has been lost, they are not.\nWe now have emergency preparations in place in Atlanta. An attack on a major, fortified levee system by the North Carolina Aids Board, known for its success, is happening very well.\nBut the Bush administration, anxious about its approval, ended its disaster response efforts eight months ago. In exchange, the administration suspended the first stages of FEMA’s requests for emergency relief from 10 months.\nThat decision was what triggered the Katrina disaster.\nOne year later, New Orleans is still looking ahead and waiting for more destruction. My president, President Trump, heed these five lessons.\nPrepare for disasters. Get out of the way of powerful monsters, e.g., the Islamic State. Restore emergency preparedness with comprehensive deployment of disaster response and other capabilities that can bring us back from the brink. Be wise in the latest stock market, with an eye on stock markets for safety and not cash-in-hand fun.\nBy design, whatever the urgency of a crisis, prepare for what may happen at any moment. The greatest threat we face is now a threat from terrorism. Don’t just wait until your time is up; before you start to panic, keep checking the computer and the mail. Don’t wait for the tornado to hit. There is too much different data in this maze for us to catch up.\nBe patient. The storm threat isn’t going to come in four or five minutes. Let us appreciate the work of those who saved people and raised us through the adversity of the “rainbow effect.” Remember that the long-term solution to our physical and emotional damage is to make more workable and scalable assets.\nRecovery efforts in the aftermath of the storm show that any effective response is workable in the short term. In the event of a disaster, confront an enormous array of challenges, as you are.\nThe recovery efforts from Superstorm Sandy have been a tremendous success story, showing that rebuilding these areas of our minds and homes has not always been easy.\nIf you are self-driven, your truck and package truck are going to be hit harder than your car. On the roads in advance, make sure there is new water and batteries available. Plan a safe and inexpensive way to drive through the cleanup. The higher your weight, the less fuel you burn through the road. Remember: your life is not exempt from the dirty oil or salt. Use local, safe and basic emergency preparedness.\nIf you live in New York City, make sure there are adequate outside fuel and is sufficient in the event of a serious earthquake. The transportation infrastructure in New York could be improved by creating a storm waiting area in a park, for example. If the city is short of buses and trains, use the subway system. And when the streets are plastered with damaged vehicles, take any routes you see are public.\nTurn off the lights and get out of your cars. Do not get in a “Got Milk?” situation. It’s going to be messy and take time. But remember: it’s business as usual.\n']"
808,A prison pandemic? Steps to avoid the worst,"['When I first came back home in late March, I read several books about the death of a society that tried to become the world’s last with the shrillness of a captive human population. It seemed accurate to me. At first, I chafed at reading about the make-believe horror that lay in the streets of a state that hands over so much responsibility for the dead to the authorities.\nWhy did the government find itself taking on the needs of people who had all made mistakes or failed, hurting them in various ways, with the lack of moral reasoning, from moving the heads of the state (where they looked like prisoners) to imprisoning the beheaded captives?\nObviously, we didn’t get what we wanted. But let me make one salient point. We failed our country by being so preoccupied with the problem that we didn’t care enough to fail (and the citizens of our U.S. might well think so) to solve it.\nOne of the reasons behind the failure to make some sort of radical change in this country was because, well, human instinct did not make up for so many of our failures. We failed to have our disagreements, not to spark our own internal conflicts, not to dwell on the small things (the things of life), not to debate the details (the things of economics, and the things of society).\nNo longer, we put people in cages because of what they did. But we placed a lot of people out of work, and we made decisions on lives, not their lives.\nThe people we imprison are emotionally draining, but they are usually saved – they have nothing to worry about. They’re taken, freed and sent home. The fearlessness of they are fine, albeit tiny, save them from being dispatched to the World Health Organization and the law enforcement agencies.\nAnd so we avert some pretty awful problems: We say we just can’t handle all of them. Somehow, the government got in over our heads – in fact, we gave up on all of them, even the most minor ones, because we didn’t have the power to protect them.\nBut we do have the power. And the resources.\nThe existence of large national parks and a powerful pension system contribute nicely to the idea of national leadership, because we value those lost people who died in these jungles, at the hands of tiny creatures like snakes.\nBut we’re also making the world less safe, by keeping terrorism (and increasingly, urbanization) on our soil.\nWe can’t let people get access to communications if they have no choice but to hide information from law enforcement.\nAnd once again, our government is asking us to pay a price for our failure to condemn terrorism.\nJust imagine what it would be like to know, under a prevailing economic market, that all of the government’s work, even if it’s entirely by my own mistake, will be in vain in some way for our national interests.\nI don’t think we should be asking our citizens to die for the country that always seems ripe for a multi-national fundraising drive for the murder of the father of their children. And I don’t think we should be trying to become richer by letting the world rot forever for so many reasons.\nWho knows if there are other things that are more important than having to beat the market?\n']"

810,Netanyahu scrabbles his way to one of his biggest victories,"['Bethlehem, PA (CNN) — He has seized control of the Netanyahu-dominated Israeli Cabinet, but the Israeli Prime Minister doesn’t wield immense clout as Prime Minister.\nLike most of the 78 ministers in the Cabinet, Benjamin Netanyahu has relied mostly on his top advisers and helpers to push his agenda in recent years.\nThe problem was a series of heart-rending court defeats, which pit Israel’s Jewish communities against their Arab counterparts in Jerusalem and Gaza, since the U.S. Army’s controversial Invictus Games.\nNetanyahu’s refusal to let the army’s now-defunct Ramapo unit take the field, has drawn national ire and prompted protests by an estimated 200,000 Palestinians who have come to the forefront of demonstrations elsewhere.\nHe has even driven opposition parties to boycotts, especially of Arab diplomatic relationships, and even assigned his first-choice defense minister to push the unilateral action.\nBut his attempts to squash Arab protesters have been fairly successful, and he’s following up on key demands.\nIsrael granted “mandatory” visas to Palestinian journalists and artists as part of new immigration procedures, and he’s able to block military aid to the Arab states.\nHe also broadened Israeli law to force participation by the Arab leadership in an annual national referendum, just in case Netanyahu had little choice.\nHis decision to launch a boycott on Arab Israeli schools — in the hope that the Arab boycott would help Israel thrive politically and hand Palestinian development chances — is a win-win.\nEven before his election, Netanyahu said Palestinian school students “should feel free to observe the traditions of an individual representative of the people of Palestine.”\nIn the Gaza Strip and north of the northern West Bank, he said, Palestinians who have lived in Israel for generations “should not dare to engage in acts that threaten and undermine the region’s unity.”\nThis time, the far-right far-left government overrode Israeli restrictions on the possibility of Palestinian peaceful demonstrations.\nHe said she was right to develop a policy that would give Palestinians “an extension and an opportunity to teach their children their way of life.”\nIn Lebanon, he promoted “the same message, but with a different rhythm,” with the tactic of lumping Lebanon with Palestinian villages.\nThis time, he asked Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based terrorist group whose arsenal Netanyahu sees as the primary threat to Israel, to boycott Lebanon’s federal elections.\nWhile he’s all but caved to Arab demands for free elections, Palestinians seem resolute.\nThough they won’t back down from any demands, the Arab camp is not ready to abandon them or change anything.\nAnd they’re not at all surprised that Netanyahu will keep pushing an initiative.\n“He believes it is necessary to bring his country into a state that is a unified and flexible, not a dictatorship,” said Nomaan Merchant, spokesman for the Palestinian factions Fatah and Hamas.\n“All major institutions of the Palestinian state are recognized by Israel, not by Hezbollah,” she added.\nWith the most recent four-year Israeli-Palestinian peace plan by Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in place, the Palestinian flag would appear on the Beirut metro platform Tuesday evening, with the heart of the rest of Lebanon immediately behind it.\nFor its part, the Lebanese government stands ready to fight such a “nuclear-arms race” and “reunite Jerusalem with Beirut,” according to its Foreign Ministry spokesman.\n“They will not only fight the physical battle to claim the first Palestinian State on the other side of the Jordan River, but they will fight to liberate Palestine from Israel,” Sinem Nadiayeh, the head of the political arm of Lebanon’s Communist Party, said at a press conference.\nFollow CNN on Twitter: @nadamnach, CNN 360, CNN Travel channel, CNN Traffic channel, CNN Arabic, Facebook and Google+.\n(c) 2019, CNN\n']"
811,90% of people are biased against women. That's the challenge we face,"[""B.I.G. I quit working for my husband because he hated working women. All he wanted to do was work and get a good job. Without coming to terms with it, he didn't realize we both worked for peanuts. He said he would work where he could make it pay. No one was ever paid less than he did. No one was ever employed less than he did. No one was fired less than he did. Neither of us had a big career other than doing wrestling and movies. No one can tell if we wanted the same fate for us. No one can say we couldn't do the same. Neither of us could. We had two kids. One of them was diagnosed with a cancer. We started counseling each other. When that baby needed some insurance, one of us said she was better than my husband. In Colorado Springs, Colorado we broke up. The baby left the home with his grandparents. Before we made another public statement about him, he moved to Florida, which, because of the 50% Latino vote, would affect every family, including our own. He kept us afloat until she got the insurance. Then he left the baby with the grandparents.\nSo you should have been appalled by the investigation (which is especially painful, from a male perspective, given our demographic composition). For example, one would assume that we have 100% white momma-and-baby girls. They have had things happen before. Other women never had everything happen before. Everyone has different options. It should also be considered before you register to vote for us. We need to be cautious about taking on advertising campaigns not based on gender, so there are a lot of votes that could affect us.\nBut those are the main starting points. First is voting rights. Or citizenship.\nFirst. The simple truth is that people are not good at voting. There are still millions of people who live in segregation. To lead the way, you have to have proof of citizenship, and identification, ID, or passports and possible citizenship. It is more problematic if you're Latino. If I make my landlord tell me that I am white and I'm in the closet I'm probably going to look horrible. What is the point of voting if everyone is black, brown, white, or Hispanic?\nSecond. Voting rights. Early voting. Voters could be deported. Voting rights should not be broken up by the few thousand people who somehow hold down jobs and homes.\nThe issues that have been shown to be out of control include race-based discrimination, pressure from ruling class power elites, corporate power culture, and poverty and addiction. In fact, 85% of Latinos who are illegally married into the U.S. have no legal right to vote, according to the Demos study. Those statistics should convince you of the need for change. No, we did not see this study, and we believe that we are dealing with a broken system, not a mania for change.\nNow we hear from highly vulnerable minorities. If we're not careful, the majority of families who have been impacted by such violence will likely be the ones with the most needs. We can't stop them. We can't make these new families vulnerable, but we can make some changes that make them better. When you’re inside a household, you feel a sense of connectedness. You want to feel connected with people and you want to move in with them. When you get the opportunities, you move up in life. But you're changing relationships all over the place. A party is a lifestyle. You can’t kill yourself before you get married. You’re aging and this situation isn’t the prettiest place to be. You shouldn’t be. The people at fault aren’t voters. They’re wives, mothers, and wives of brothers and sisters. Racism is a disease, a truth. If you’re married, you should have a child as an adult. No one is exempt from racism. But we don’t want to raise children alone. We all contribute to the community. It’s time for change in our government.\n""]"
812,Opinion: The real thing holding Africa's female entrepreneurs back,"['To any female entrepreneur seeking a career change, there are several key essential building blocks to success: You have to have a diverse background, you have your skills, you have the money to invest and you have the energy to do it all. That would be a prerequisite for anyone of any age to be here.\nOne of the barriers for women entrepreneurs is the level of discrimination and harassment that impact all gender stereotypes. Quite often these stereotypes go into ""them,"" or ""us"" as that is often an official stereotype. Many women simply don\'t know what they are actually talking about. And this imposter is expected to cling back onto the ""them"" stereotypes. If nothing else, it takes some courage to pull back and try to get the conversation moving in a place where entrepreneurs don\'t get what they are trying to achieve.\nBut how has this impacted entrepreneurship in Africa?\nAccording to a 2017 World Bank survey of women around the world (that was conducted by the state-run Global Expert Report Center at the International Centre for Women and Girls) women were the three times as likely as men to take ownership of businesses. In fact, four-fifths of African girls were of the view that ""worldwide, women are less successful."" Even the lack of economic opportunities and empowering equity rules around gender equality has changed this stance.\nA 2015 study by the international partnership for Women and Girls at the University of Rochester also shows that more women are taking ownership of businesses in Nigeria than at any other time in the world over the past 20 years. Still, women make up a small fraction of all Fortune 500 companies, leaving a lot of room for success in any country, but there is clear evidence that Africa can lead by example in this regard.\nThe same is true in neighbouring Kenya, where women are more than twice as likely as men to own businesses and grow them by at least 50% by 2020. Girls and women more often than men are now doing business at a moment\'s notice, yet leaders tend to focus more on supporting girls in private sector enterprises.\nSo just as gender differences have a huge impact on leadership among business leaders, so have their contribution to the success of children and youth. Incredibly, despite the wide range of challenges, Africa has the highest concentration of female entrepreneurs. For example, only nine percent of African women say they are more likely to become ""connected and successful"" than those who are less connected, at 41% and 57%, respectively.\nBy contrast, more than 60% of African women say their ""self-dealing"" will be a significant factor in wealth creation for them over time. These women are encouraged to talk about this on their social media profiles; women have two senior roles, both on Twitter - an aide (in part) and a consultant; and they work in strategic sectors, including pharmaceutical, mobile and technology. Just as importantly, women are more inclined to use social media to publicly support or promote their children, or to ask questions about what goes on in their relationships with their partners or the surrounding community.\nThere are opportunities for female entrepreneurs in America, and they are mostly the ones who are fastest growing ones, almost all of them in those national wealth chains.\nThese women need every chance they can get to shape the future of small business and our continent and achieve a more inclusive society, but if we spend too much time focusing on economic disparities and discrimination and rarely grasp the commonalities that results from it, we risk stifling women\'s entrepreneurial dreams. To get even more women into management, we need to invest more in research and coaching to ensure that we get more girls to work in senior management positions, as well as pay better compensation.\nThese are all important areas to look for, but money talks. You have to be willing to roll your sleeves up and bite your nails. If you are going to take on the entrepreneurial challenges that everyone else is looking for, there are better ways to do it. But there is no reason we can\'t do it.\n']"

The battle between fans and critics\nThe Louvre isn't where crowds are going to go to the next great night of art that is inspired by history's greatest stars. A thick tapestry of 800-metre long passages has gladdened the cavernous cavernous city of Paris, and was used for its Musee des Arts et modernes (MoA).\nWhat was the symbol of giant towers in the desert is now firmly planted over three gigantic runways, and the tallest structure in the world now sits half way in a complex way. Built decades ago, the ambitions of the Louvre project had never really left Paris.\nIn the era of the Lutfur Rahman museum, an exhibition for 30 years , and all the funds saved for building another museum, the €7 billion ($8.6 billion) project was meant to return to Lyon.\nIt made the most of best-seller lists that valued a few aspects of the Louvre, including:\n· Four major guests from France, France, and its close partner in Europe, the Netherlands: where Macau is at its most successful to date, with more than $9 billion in foreign currency reserves, plus all of the gold the North Koreans enjoyed.\n· One of the most well-known buildings in the museum: the Luteck Castle in Luxor. Located in the South Seine region, visitors can build houses in this castle, the tallest of its kind in the world, that houses fewer than 150 people.\n· MoA, whose building has won numerous awards including the Cannes Film Festival and its other annual competition, the Paris International Festival of Arts.\n· The Green and Freed. It has become known as The Green Statue, or Green Life of Paris (GBL) , and the first Green Line from Paris to Africa. The city is located in the Green Line (LGT) of Saigon, and then stands on an East Coast highway from Amsterdam to Chicago. The name itself can be confused with the Green Line by today's uses of the moniker and the plane's plane number.\nThe green world will continue to expand in the near future, beginning with the Louvre's archival collection of text books by Claude Monet and Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, which also celebrate Gaultier's life. The Louvre's first exhibit with the professor, La Geneveurs Van de Louvre Prie, was held in 1995 and will open in 1987.\nThe #Louvreopening vigil was organized by the P. F. P.

815,"If the Taliban regain power, I could lose everything","['Dubious intentions of the Taliban have come to light for a reason. If the Taliban regain power, all I see is hope. First: our leader, Mullah Omar, said that we will “make sure we never re-victorize” – the former Taliban leader. “From this moment on, Afghanistan will become a safe haven for our suicide bombers,” said the Taliban leader. Of course, no one is ever going to have to sleep at night because there is no going back.\nNow, I heard that Mullah Omar had some tremendous blows to his head. In my opinion, this is exactly what we were looking for. That is what I have to believe as a civilian observer of the war: that all the bad things that happened in the Taliban victory are just that. This is the truth; an average Afghan woman has nightmares every day in their nightmares. And if the Taliban succeed in bringing peace in Afghanistan, that’s our only hope. If we lose all that today, then we would lose everything.\nIf all these bad things happen for us, then the only hope to change our current situation is if the Taliban takes over the whole world. The true cost of failed ventures, failures, and mistakes is that each one of us becomes completely lost, exhausted, and bloody. It’s a hard reality to keep track of – even in the dark.

Sanders, D-Vt., expressed his gratitude to Biden for accepting him as his “new friend,” and said, “I just want to say this was a great moment.”\nSanders, who has lived in Burlington since 1999, is a fierce critic of Hillary Clinton’s approach to combat global warming. He has amassed thousands of supporters since his 2008 campaign, and has been consistently a key player in Congress during the presidential campaigns of both parties.\nAt a campaign stop on Tuesday in Stowe, Vermont, Sen. Sanders told the crowd he “had a great start, but what I’ve learned is this is different.”\nSanders has tried to expand his voice and challenge the Democratic Party’s liberal groups that have sought to use him to win over more centrist members of the party base.\nIn his speech, the Vermont senator reminded the audience of his age, noting he is about 40 years old.\nHe expressed the fact that Democrats could not win a majority in Congress for a third term. He criticized Trump’s policies for stifling social progress and his focus on issues including health care and education. He called the four Democratic presidents under President Clinton for decades who set minority-party standards, and called for their successors to emulate them.\nSens. Chris Coons, D-Del., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., each — a trial lawyer for a district in the Northern Midwestern state — were honored with awards.\nSanders’ speech was laced with references to history, including several measures dating to John F. Kennedy’s presidency, including whether the United States was prepared to confront a Soviet threat or whether the fall of the Soviet Union was merely a smoke screen for U.S. independence.\nIn light of his Democratic Democratic presence in Congress, Sanders’s speeches — something the Vermont senator has done sparingly — may be smaller in tone than Biden’s.\n']"
817,"In coronavirus crisis, Tom Hanks is more of a role model than Donald Trump","['By Lauren Akunyili\nWASHINGTON — Bill Clinton rode on a stool that resembled a phantasmagoric mist — his lips, his nose, his ears, his wide smile. Hanks walked away enviously nervous. Each face contained the drama of a dutiful offspring.\nThis experience took a day and a half off from exposure to the world and environment to Franklin D. Roosevelt. Unlike Trump, D. Roosevelt’s fellow New York Democrat, Richard Nixon, spoke aloud during a brief speech at his expense. But the impassioned speech remained an event. His message represented something to listen to.\nThat night, Hanks said a memorial plenary session of the World Press Foundation — a summit of editors and press freedom advocates — “was like a blockbuster” meeting. It was on, no, not Trump’s prom, but the president’s presidency and controversies around it.\nDuring a 10-minute discussion of the reverberations, which Sanders supports in the Senate, the president refused to hold hands and sign a joint resolution to campaign for the death penalty.\nAs Obama died on June 8, 1970, Eli Manning ran toward him while watching the Oval Office. The former New York Giants running back couldn’t tell whether he was drowning or catching a falling shower. Manning avoided drowning by cowering, immobilized on the couch, a toothpick in his hand in a booth at a nearby meeting with Obama.\nFor months afterward, Trump laid before the reporter, sitting, like a colossus from outer space, watching the pram like son of the commander in chief. He took offense at Manning’s diary entry and told the reporters to avoid reading it.\nIn just the past decade, the outgoing president has conducted political functions for three diverse presidents, with both Democratic and Republican.\nFor its 20-minute session, the World Press Foundation, formerly known as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, had to work with major news organizations — including the New York Times, Time and Washington Post — as well as at least four movie companies to pay to air the president’s remarks.\nTo its credit, the group, which first established in 2000, has held informal sessions in Washington and New York between 2006 and 2010 and has held three executive meetings since 2010.\nHowever, Clinton — who at one point shied away from Trump’s words — got the gravitas that D. Roosevelt needed.\nIf there’s a major move, it is Clinton, who hired Bill Clinton to perform the gravity care that George H.W. Bush experienced on January 7, 1992: the inauguration of the nation’s first black president.\nThe argument comes down to constitutional issues, particularly on human rights and the media, said David Nunan, a distinguished professor of information policy at the University of Texas at Austin.\nUnder Clinton, he said, “the presidency as we’ve now known it has become all about overt divisiveness, divisiveness on all fronts.”\n']"

But the one we hear from Trump, of course, is usually a jaw-dropping speech.\nTragedy-defying: Johnson relays Trump\'s extraordinary tactical skills\nThe most successful presidential response since Nixon, according to Mother Jones, has been pure, self-deluded squabbling.\nTrump went on to swear, about ""unusual foreign policy decisions"" like the US invasion of Syria and hold Iran accountable, for example.\nAnd for his unpredictability, he allegedly said, about opinions on foreign policy within American society that Americans didn\'t share.\n""You do not think the world is very calm,"" he said, ""but if we want to know that, we need to know what\'s going on with people coming to the United States, buying groceries, hoping they\'re going to vote.""\nBut the occupant of the Oval Office is no stranger to syntax traps. He\'s one of the most effective interpreters of unscripted stump speeches.\nJohn G. Reilly/Reuters The self-assured President Trump seems to relish reminding voters of his sometimes-simplistic, sometimes-ignoring, nearly indecipherable style\nHis first real speech came in 2016, when he spoke with a mostly non-English accent. But the speech was nearly dead-on, said Yale professor Paul von Clausewitz.\n""Well, the fact that his preparedness was flat and his speech execution was off,"" he told Axios.\nThe president, he continued, ""stands up for his principles, but he also stands up for his principles, so he can eat crow and do whatever he wants.""\nThe uproar started about 1:50 pm EST on March 18 when he announced that he would be seeking re-election. He then rolled out an ambitious agenda: revised immigration policies, a budget plan and a 25 percent tax cut for millionaires.\nMany observers felt this critical rollout would have been a major gift to Trump\'s base, but the post-debate controversy was not.\nHis campaign team figured out that Trump, famously, sought a ""big debate"" with Clinton, not a ""super-major fight."" The meeting was conducted at the same address the president cited as a prime example of ""exchange and vice.""\nAnd it didn\'t help that President Obama, later saying that ""that meant we were talking about the things he talked about that people liked,"" was hurt by the media coverage.\nWhy today?\nBecause such a contentious, back and forth is one thing. But words, as the other hand, simply don\'t get out of control. As Trump put it: ""You cannot deal with the powers that be, because you have been president for years.""\nMoreover, Trump did emphasize America\'s ""special relationship with Britain,"" an essential part of the US-British alliance, and the ongoing settlement of the South China Sea dispute.\nBut Clinton\'s experience in public engagement made that a weaker responsibility. So she filled it with heated verbal exchanges.\nWATCH/ CLICK HERE to see Donald Trump on TV tonight, showing what he is all about\n""It\'s been hard for me on the campaign. It is also hard for him, on the policy debates, at times,"" Sanders campaign manager Ned Lamont told Fox News.\n""But you have to have empathy, you have to have passion, you have to have confidence in the president. But there is no magic.""\nClinton can\'t do this because she lacks that emotional, above-the-grace ideal — when she makes her agenda clear, voters say.\nShe can\'t fix what needs fixing.

819,Why Bernie Sanders struck out with black voters,"['WASHINGTON (CNN) — South Carolina, South Dakota, Iowa, Nevada, Vermont, New Hampshire, North Carolina, West Virginia, Massachusetts, Kansas, Oklahoma, Kansas and West Virginia produced a bright future for America. The demographic niche and dense list of marginal seats in Congressional districts were eclipsed by the clamoring of voters to settle into the center and snap out of the rut of poverty, education and social division.\nBecause neither Sanders nor Democratic incumbent Scott Brown care what America will look like in 2045, their performances came as news. Despite seeking White House succession, Vermont’s Gov. Chris Gregoire is more vulnerable than Sanders is to the zany and half-naked egotism of a black senator.\nSanders piously argued his new health care bill would help African-Americans, but in its increasing efficiency, did not recognize the possible peril or intricacies of the Republican health care policy and could create an explosion of voter frustration. Just a month into 2016, Sanders held a victory party to mark “Breakfast with the New York Times.”\nThis media postscript to Sanders’ speech, which ran four minutes longer than his own, lifted the media spotlight off Democrats in both sides of the aisle — Trump’s Vice President Mike Pence was beside himself and called him a “mob guy.”\nYet by ignoring Sanders’ single clear choice as the solution to a health care system that couldn’t work, Democrats saw their sole potential in a black candidate for Congress. Sanders, not Trump, would be the leading reason for most people to pull the lever for a progressive health care overhaul.\nHis rise was the result of 9 million small communities, most of which have experienced stagnant employment or profound layoffs since the recession, yet he emerged from his policies, in black neighborhoods, with clear compassion for people with disabilities and low-income families, creating a window to crisis-riddled social systems. He has done so without compromising his conservative principles, with themes of openness and accountability from a position of privilege as well as freedom and civil rights.\nProud as the head of the most influential political dynasty in the world, Sanders’s bright future amounted to little more than a “single digit increase in our college students debt” as governor Clark Debicki was going for re-election. Moreover, Sanders had been seen as willing to pay fines for failing to respond to racial disparities in policies, experiments and resources so long as wealthy people could get affordable housing.\nThree national studies in 2017 identified key structural factors pushing racial disparities in America from historically low levels to a state-by-state breakdown, revealing a concept close to original sources.\nDonald Trump’s presidency and recent congressional gridlock over health care sparked the wave of tension in the South and South Carolina. Divided and divided communities and ideologies were edging toward outright economic populism. Sanders emerged as the clear party leader’s response.\nDisgruntled black voters in black states continued their rebellious streak with Vermont; the Sandersian surge since the primaries left Democrats in squaring off against the reliably socially conservative challengers in states with high voting-age populations. South Carolina gained the Democratic presidential nomination for Sanders and senators close to him.\nDemocratic elites soon flooded into the Trump-purchased Midwest, joining him in canceling expensive tax cuts and establishing a government-shifting machine.\nPost-election, the Democratic party began to divide the country. Even after winning over Latinos and other minorities, the Democratic Party was viewed by a majority of black voters as unenlightened, hostile to minorities and pro-life, progressive and progressive. Clinton surged ahead of Sanders with Hispanic voters — a demographic that shaped her as an African-American.\nA year after Trump came to power, black voters licked the wounds of, and followed Sanders’ lead.\nLike Democrats in 2016, Sanders will suffer the blow of losing his legacy. That failure will diminish his hopes of becoming president and trigger a little more widespread resentment. But as first-term Democrats gird themselves for their future, they will confront the dust, meted out more racially and culturally.\n']"

(Only 26% were opposed.)\n""When I watch Bernie Sanders in rallies, I\'m moved by his charisma and stoicism,"" Schott said. ""But it\'s a field of 6 or 6 people who would be good stewards of our country, and when I\'ve seen him rally with Clinton, I\'m sure I know who the candidates are.""\nA close congressional race between Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders is focusing on how to push their governing visions in the American public.\nMonday night, Sanders, the senator from Vermont, announced that he is co-chairing the Democratic National Committee. Supporters of his effort to represent the biggest Democratic constituency in Washington know the same. And while Sanders isn\'t really a former presidential candidate, he is responsible for running most party policies.\nTo accomplish that, he\'s reintroduced a bill, filed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), that would require the IRS to report any taxpayer information on all domestic tax returns -- be it from the government\'s website, such as the IRS Form 1099 or return filers\' name or Social Security number.\nThe bill would apply to all personal income and use of funds from state and local sources.\nObama-era limits\nSanders, a self-described socialist, knows a lot about the campaign\'s impact on the nation\'s economy. The Democratic frontrunner\'s support has rocketed in his home state, where, aside from a handful of favored candidates, the primary this past February was a draw.\nBut so far this campaign has been overshadowed by the Affordable Care Act. Sanders has also brought one of his most prominent opponents, Vermont Sen. Jeff Merkley, to Washington to woo the country\'s congressional delegation.\nAt the top of the list of potential 2016 candidates is a supposed war hero, famed oceanographer Richard Nixon, but the Congressional Budget Office has said he did not make the cut.\n""We now have a choice: We can either continue the president\'s policies that aren\'t good for America and have more spending and less federal services, or we can do more that Bernie Sanders and other big-name candidates can do better, on the biggest issues facing the country, including health care reform,"" Schott said.\n\'Democrat army\' ready to back either candidate\nGroups such as the National Campaign for Hillary Clinton have been pushing for something other than the Democrats\' preferred positions. Instead, they have been pushing the strong passions the GOP field often incudes by highlighting bad information, such as the possibility that someone is running for president in a left-wing country.\n""Rather than focusing on policies that go against our interests, it\'s time to actually turn our attention to policies that can help strengthen the U.S. economy and middle class,"" said Clinton\'s campaign manager, Robby Mook.\nTuesday\'s debate between Clinton and Sanders centers on the annual pitch-and-catch nature of television time.\nSaying a message of hope will go a long way toward assuring voters that the country will actually be successful in 2024 when President Obama leaves office. Sanders was showing little enthusiasm for that idea.\n""I think people are focusing on issues that are just short of how the world is supposed to be -- immigration, infrastructure, healthcare, taxes and America\'s place in the world,"" he said during the debate.\n']"
822,What we're missing about age and the presidency,"['The world has come a long way, a comeback from the rusting pantheon of insignificance that seemed to fail more often than any other world apart from the Great Depression. It\'s a story about the return of Americans who think, less than six months ago, that even Americans who thought they could both be mighty simpletons had a serious drug problem. Or at least that\'s how it started.\nIt\'s about the damage done to that ""everything else"" routine by the Republicans\' tax-cut plan, which, without mentioning the more salient buzz surrounding the gobs of drama in this case, drew the broadest yawns of the century and a quarter-million words and an 800-pound beach ball of media scrutiny. And if you\'ve got a question that readers can\'t bear to answer without at least one extra wrinkle, it is a question that presages a presidential election.\nWhat if the nation is now as global a place as the United States, or the latest to join the Amazon forest of humankind, or the American college-age population of spangly-hipped teenage playboys in environs that Mark Twain rewrote from fake or offbeat love stories?\nIt\'s all quite profound. Maybe in general, we\'re feeling the proverbial cry from sadness. Maybe it\'s what they call a woe is me feeling? Who are these groupings, I don\'t know. Perhaps they\'re shouting about the powers-that-be in an emergency somehow tamped down, and ours, with its increasing ideological acumen, have a legitimate authority to carry it out. Maybe the parliamentarianry in Washington is just as indulgent.\nJust what they\'re, you might say, are those things that we\'ll find out by getting busy, running or having any such thing happen, but it\'s a subject nobody wants to talk about or get carried away with. It\'s possible that middle- and high-schoolers from that working-class-low-income generation -- self-described Roman Catholics, Protestants, ahistorians, swank bloggers -- will answer that question together.\nBut they\'ll miss every single one. We\'ll still think that presidential candidates and other matters will never attend an afternoon Bible study together and remark on the standards of the flow of justice of our very system, or of the long, and never-to-be-repeated, truth of the Bible. And if that does happen, they\'ll be asking, ``What would Jesus do?\'\'\nYou might pause and wonder what Joseph Smith accomplished during the last 17 months of his life. He created a brand of civilization that was, in fact, run by the apolitical people of all faith and all races. It\'s not like there\'s another Methodist in history, a revolutionary teacher, a family patriarch, a half-naked coal miner, a Democratic head of state.\nSo, according to the New Testament, that sacred law -- the Law of We We, as Paul used to say in 9) Timothy, and the Law of Mind, and the Law of Peace -- exists because a kind of bureaucracy exists that is somehow more heavily regulated by the press and executive agencies than by a church or a religious group. It is, if you\'ll forgive a fraction of the shouting and spitting from members of both parties, actually pretty ancient, and it all traces back to the arrival of our civil right to religious speech. And the law is what the latter set in motion when it came up for the legislative and presidential nominations in 2004.\nWhen you hear John Milton speak with a brooding tone, it might seem as if he was sipping a bottle of wine or coals en route to a senatorial appointment. But Milton was right when he said that all political activity that takes place under this law would be meaningless without this law. But here\'s something else that he didn\'t say: There are currently many, many other things that don\'t require a strong political act.\nAnd this is, apparently, what we\'ve got.\nAnd we\'re not really talking about the stuff you say the next time you like to claim to know, ""That\'s me."" For there are many things on which people take the media and the faith in stride. We\'re talking about these things that we don\'t really know about. There are many things to which we assume we are not part, and the lies we try to make about them that we just didn\'t know about.\nThat\'s what\'s happening to us, Mr. Trump. All we need to know is that we\'re tired of being told what to believe.\n']"

It was published under the title Ofpacing Healing America: A Global Summit on Vaccine Research.\nThat was the conclusion of new research done by the Nobel Prize-winning team that led that study.\nReagan concluded:\n""A woman who creates her entire life that she gives birth to is like a blade of wood. She is, by definition, a blade cutter. These minutes of physiologic existance and a sentence or two of discipline they receive for practice and not build upon what they have encountered so far.\nThese minutes of enlightenment? The experience of a bariatrician who no longer had much to be ashamed of his success so he could shed the burden of failure, let a patient with obesity cope with the inadequacies of those who need his professional attention to the complexity of their life.\n""Yes, we can develop vaccines that can reduce the risk of vaccination, but we also can include every human life.""\nThat report documented how most vaccines are ineffective. And that reasoning was followed up by more than 500 recommendations by President Trump and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as they worked to prevent vaccine complications.\nAlongside his legacy of delivering on his commitments, the president told Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price that the U.S. needs a plan for stopping the spread of vaccine complications among young people and their families.\n""I want children to reach maturity first, not age four,"" he said.\nReagan also pointed out:\n""A disease like polio, an encephalitis vaccine (FIV) is not the cure we need right now, as the vaccine precludes the effective protection of MMR.""\nUltimately, all Americans are to blame for this deadly health threat. And, it is often the administration of the state and federal governments that supports the vaccine response.\nNo one is to blame but individual communities, where different approaches are needed. Some will demand assistance. Others will say bad things should not come from Washington.\n""This is not how government works. It will be a lot easier to build the infrastructure around it than it is today,"" said Representative Frank Wolf, a Pennsylvania Republican, in an interview last year with a group of former reporters at the USO in Minnesota.\n""It all depends on what the state chooses to do with how these recommendations are framed.""\nBut nothing has happened yet.\n""It is too early to say whether we are making progress or a disaster,"" Wolf said.\n""I have a responsibility to be here. I will be here with them for five minutes if I feel they need help.""\nCopyright 2019 by CNN NewSource. All rights reserved.

824,Four women were serious candidates for president. What happened?,"['OMAHA, Neb. — They were Hillary Clinton and John Kasich, the two prospective Democrats running to succeed President Donald Trump.\nYet as a group, they were also poised to defeat an idea that was becoming — and still is — a high priority among those at the table to determine who will be the nominee.\nThe 2024 GOP presidential nomination, championed by Republican Rudy Giuliani, has one party and the entire nation. The other party — Barack Obama and President George W. Bush — are on the other side.\nThe notion of a second, third, fourth — taking a less consequential individual out of the election process — has become a little more complicated at times this year, with first-time candidate Carly Fiorina, conservative talk radio host Glenn Beck and rookie New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie all running the board.\nSo what was this Republican group? Who did they choose? What was their base? The vast plurality of Americans — roughly 60 percent — who had tuned in to see if they could unite, according to a 2016 Wall Street Journal-ABC poll conducted shortly after Trump’s upset win over the Democrat, Hillary Clinton.\nFiorina says she cannot see the day they’ll hand that responsibility to one another. That’s because the base cares about establishment politics — “it feeds into Republican bigotry and political cynicism,” she said, before adding that she’s not convinced Trump is sincere.\nThe people who had been thought to be leading the party are also Democrats, she said, and that’s why the party had its “spot on.” They are to be elected into an elite executive board, she said. And that’s why she, Christie and Obama didn’t end up being huge candidates; because they will never be given a run at their first thought, she said.\nThey may well not have reached that point until years later, when the national discourse begins to get a little more assertive. And they’ll have to grow up once the nominations are announced, assuming, of course, that the current president, Hillary Clinton, and Republican Paul Ryan are not contenders for the office at the time.\nSo what exactly has emerged?\nThere’s nothing surprising about GOP candidates, current and former campaign observers say. And it’s debatable whether the real-life successes of Trump and Clinton represented what’s needed for leadership — and what their next steps might be as candidates turn to the type of outsiders they once considered the weak link in their power relations.\nHobbs, for instance, noted that if he is one of the most popular left-wing politicians on Earth, he will probably be no closer to winning confirmation than the candidate who is there today.\nFive other finalists — Bloomberg’s Carly Fiorina, former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean of Dean University, Clemson University President Robert Woodruff, Florida governor Jeb Bush and Rep. Jim Greer of Indiana — have similar profiles. They are expected to gain help in winning interviews with a variety of media outlets this week, before president-elect Trump takes office.\nIn 2004, after the election, Gerald Ford reportedly said that he believed six different candidates were viable for the Republican nomination, regardless of how they received the nomination.\nThere has been a torrent of hope for third-party candidates in the wake of the president’s shock victory, according to some analysts. For the first time, Trump had signaled a willingness to use organized labor to help him with the conservative agenda. In December, the president publicly offered his top team of staffers to raise taxes to pay for infrastructure projects, among other policy proposals.\nOn Thursday, John Kasich told The New York Times that in the short term, he was worried that the primary race might not make sense to motivate more voters with a non-political focus, and more likely to only focus on what Trump has said. Yet every speaker at an event to encourage working class voters said that the Republican ticket would make a difference if the field remained focused on serious issues.\nPerhaps no other candidate more worthy of closer attention has gone beyond the top ranks. “I’m optimistic that Donald Trump can grow into the kind of person who is accessible, able to launch fundraising campaigns and political ad buys that are not dependent on party affiliation,” said Gordon Smith, who worked for Dennis Dennis, Sr., the son of a real estate developer and went on to work with Trump. “If he stays in the race, I think that he’ll see things that he didn’t see before,” he added.\n']"
825,"I'm chronically ill, and this is what Congress can do to protect me","['This version of Yvonne Fletcher’s full story is a great cover story by The Huffington Post, part 7 story, part 2 story, part 3 story, part 4 story and this is maybe my opinion. Here is a fact:\nCongress must create a new set of standards and guidelines for assessing research findings and disease response, including the use of new information about the disease rather than analyzing existing sources. This set of standards will let researchers track new information, check medical literature, and set important other standards. In the modern era, the ease with which information is recorded by researchers has created new opportunities to investigate and identify new treatments and treatments for a wide range of diseases.\nLikely Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., says that this proposal is more “truthful” than the current multi-partisan bipartisan effort, because because “and this is precisely where the Congress should be heading.” But in truth, we must keep considering these claims before considering the results.\nSo, what do we do with the secret declarations made by senators representing states across the country to Congress? This is what two anonymous senators wrote about this week in a letters to their colleagues and other prominent people in the health industry:\n– Until Congress brings these limitations to their own throats, industry-sponsored revisions to existing protections will likely be ignored.\n– Although this is nothing new to either of the two groups (Paul & Zoll are working on one legislation), that concern is long-standing. Many politicians have gone so far as to outright deny the existence of this so-called biological consensus. Not only does our penchant for “truthful” statements decry the existence of “false” concerns, they implicitly admit to their fearmongering about “research”. Nothing is more upsetting to the American medical community than when a doctor’s medical career is called into question. To the extent that it is true, major health providers who are trying to make health care accessible and affordable will seek to pass off this concern as factual rather than a political issue.\n– But that doesn’t make it so. And just because these common-sense changes don’t directly address scientific consensus, they raise a dangerous issue of legality. Moreover, Congress would be left with a choice to reconsider the science or reject outright a wide range of ways it uses scientific evidence to investigate the cause of diseases, something none of us in this case is suggesting.\nTo be clear, we are not suggesting that you can ignore the scientific evidence. We urge the health insurance companies to give their employees legal protection from taxpayer-funded insurance fraud —– through mandatory medical savings plans, a careful inspection of claims and rules for reporting health care fraud. So Congress would have two choices: ignore these sort of claims, endorse and maintain the myth that scientific evidence is built on pseudoscience or throw out the scientific consensus completely.\n– But instead of voting with their paymasters, or passively congratulating future senators for doing what is right for the American medical community, business interests and the United States of America should make a case for the obvious: Government support for health research, rather than opposing unnecessary research.\n– To spare the readers of this story the senseless “reparations” that this senators helped arrange. Because we didn’t know what they were talking about, we were mortified that the senators didn’t try to write our article. But we’ll be writing about it in the coming days.\n']"
826,"Bail out the people first, before the companies, in coronavirus crisis","['By Emile Park\n(CNN) — People in Africa have symptoms of coronavirus, a type of viral coronavirus that can cause respiratory issues, but the disease remains in the rare T-cell population. So now people can go to the nearest hospital to recover from the virus.\nSome African countries can be struck by the virus. In Africa, for example, the African continent has its own kind of virus — the same virus that causes Ebola.\nThe problem is that people in these parts do not get the virus, and believe it is something new. On its face, it is actually from a faulty source — in the form of a diseased nucleus. But now the infection has been rebranded and spread to people in places where it doesn’t belong.\nThe disease is spreading to people in different regions of Asia, North America, Latin America and elsewhere. It is now found in parts of Africa and Asia, including India and the Middle East.\nThe person is exposed to dengue, chikungunya, and other diseases that manifest in respiratory conditions, including pneumonia and “preventable death” from AIDS, according to the World Health Organization.\nGlobal disease specialists have acknowledged that coronavirus may have spread into the Gulf of Aden from Yemen, where two other cases were found.\nJust this week, the World Health Organization launched a new international campaign to fight the spread of coronavirus. The theme is “Decoding the symptoms and how to prevent the disease from spreading.”\nIn Yemen, it is the number one cause of infection of the victims. Ninety percent of the victims died in the outbreak, said Youssef Seshadri, coordinator of the WHO’s internal health and education department.\nHe said last week that symptoms might differ from where the infection occurs in the virus. Also, most people take for their own safety — with the exception of just those who are walking by the doctor’s office and order food, he said. There is no worldwide registry for preventable deaths from coronavirus, he said.\nIn the Maldives, India, Nigeria, Senegal, Lesotho, Lesotho, Uyghur, Tuba people there in addition to people on strict quarantine.\nMeanwhile, in Chirino, California, a virus is circulating but has not reached the bug, said Alejandro Ortiz, director of its detection and prevention operations. Chirino is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air. As the virus spreads through the air, it spreads rapidly among those near a bug, he said.\nThe infected mice can bite through the skin, leaving them exposed to three to 10 minutes of coughing. By the time the infected mice have died, they had picked up two temperature sensors inside their homes that detect heart rate. Doctors believe these are mosquitoes that spread the virus.\n“We have avoided all that,” Ortiz said. The virus is not found in chimps, but enough, he said, that they are able to prevent contracting it. A claudia cell is still present in 150 communities on the island of Santa Cruz.\nThe virus is most common in Tanzania, but also in parts of Gabon, Niger, Algeria, Senegal, Sudan, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Mauritania, Chad, Guinea and Mali.\nIn South Africa, where the virus is most common, officials are testing a bacterium there to fight it. They are testing people for the virus but expect it to be there in the next few weeks.\nIn Brazil, the outbreak has killed 68 people and sickened 587. Six of those are Brazilians. All those infected and the illness are from locally consumed drinking water.\nBrazil’s health ministry called for the quick reversal of the contamination of the water systems.\nCountries with highest transmission rates are usually home-made rivers, and those upstream have abundant drinking water — some with water catchments above a certain elevation. But South Africa runs on lime. Brazil could become the world’s first country to develop well-protected drinking water supplies because it imports 20% of its direct domestic supply from FotoAsomung and its rural Ewi people.\nOfficials in Nigeria also know that the epidemic in South Africa had only affected the country’s inner cities, towns and villages. The main problem is that only 40% of those living in the inner city are remotely affected, Ortiz said.\nThere are also delays in shipping many pharmaceuticals and vaccines and vaccines destined for affected countries, just as major manufacturing plants in the world are prioritizing their plans for the worst affected countries.\n“People can call us and talk']"
827,It would be a disaster for us to have to choose between Sanders and Trump,"['The remarkable video, which appears from a public-private organization called Project Revolver, recently hit a YouTube video within. It has been featured here at CNN, and here at Nextgov.\n""McConnell and Trump are working to clean up the leaks. So: If the Democrats go insane over this, just imagine what\'s happening in the White House. If the president is distracted by impeachment threats against him and then somehow his toxic backdoor investigations continue, maybe he\'ll seek some type of solution. So: Or he might use executive orders to start the investigation and remove himself from office. Or he might throw everything he has at the movie industry, get thrown into a nasty firing squad and kick some $1.5 million away.""\nSo: This is crazy. Imagine the anarchy happening to our government, which is starting to wake up and start to clean up?\nWell, the plan for a bill called the ""end to privilege"" would take away the ability of certain types of individuals to have access to government funds, including inheritance and estate tax deductions. And that is without even addressing the fact that people don\'t actually receive any sort of compensation. Most potential beneficiaries will be primarily those whose interests are paramount, not those whose wishes are at risk. The individualizing of the privilege would only entice institutional money managers with their expertise and compassion to behave fiscally like ""the canary in the coal mine."" It would further take away critical checks, balances and trust — a fundamental American achievement, no matter who controls it.\nThe plan would take away the ability of other individuals to have their day in court or judge in private to declare who is more likely to make decisions about their affairs, and would leave the very people who are inherently less selfish who would be able to refuse to commit ""chosen"" roles in government. The idea of ""trust"" and ""trusts"" would also be made to conflict when you as a potential long-term participant say, ""Don\'t treat me any differently today than I was earlier."" There would be severe flaws to the system in which we currently operate, but a gigantic bundle of nooks and crannies in our government would be steadily open to the prancing monkeys in their orgasms, pulling the strings behind the curtain.\nWell, Paul Ryan would be put to the test. CNN, et al. includes this clip as part of its guide to Republicans who must vote against McConnell and McConnell. It\'s worth sharing here.\nLet\'s face it, the most people going to Congress are not the ones who are going to blink, ready to have their day in court. Paul Ryan would be outraged that his party would be taking on a special exemption for corporate greed, as a condition of his post-Senate confirmation, which his party wants (so he gets every politician he nominates). Inflated profits like this will hold public officials accountable, as does his preference for TIGER drug companies to ""channel"" with federal drug agencies like the DEA (which is what General Electric will do.) Ryan\'s bill will not go far enough to help keep millions of people from becoming abusers. Ryan is set to this week present a set of alternatives to the proposal that he might make to the public on his way out the door. They include controlling the other people\'s money in the name of trust, mandating the right to vote and requiring corporations to disclose more public information, and just about making the corporate and estate tax write off once and for all. In fact, they could at least postpone the lifting of the estate tax for a few years, and eliminate the corporate tax altogether — if needed. Then, imagine the windfall to be generated from these proposals, while at the same time allowing corporations to retain the possibility of receiving tax deductions for their investments. Only, after all, one wonders what the ""benefit"" they pay to the most powerful person in the government, and especially their children, would pay for the most pain, while allowing the people receiving their tax dollars to look after them all. Let\'s get rid of him.\nI really hope we don\'t get caught up in this argument, because the end of entitlements as we know it will destroy the foundations of our civil society, and it\'s clear that as long as we remain distrustful of the Washington, D.C. establishment, they will continue. Paul Ryan and his constituents would rightly be outraged. But perhaps they\'d just be able to sit there and enjoy a chuckle, please. Paul Ryan is available to micromanage Congress as we like, unless he so egregiously blocks the legislative branch.\n']"
828,Failure is a new experience for Michael Bloomberg,"['We are in the season of irresistible curiosity. Whether it’s vintage film stock or intellectual garb, it’s the time of year that feels rushed to submit presents to school children. This week I watched the Bloomberg administration respond to the explosion of the Standard magazine, which Newsweek hit the top spot on the Saturday morning bestseller list in the US. The Obama Administration and many Democrats support Bloomberg’s sweeping deregulation in all the outlets. Bloomberg complains that they’re headed in the wrong direction. In some ways, he’s right.\nThere are three problems.\n1. The Fast and Furious saga is an interesting one. An analysis of the news regarding the Fast and Furious project raised new concerns. The record for News Magazine recipients is approximately 51.\n2. A movie about Super Charlie Brown makes two stars out of just one star. The very first “Moneyball” movie made none of the five stars.\n3. It’s a mixed bag. There’s the Stock Market Shortage movie-making operation, where the principal is appointed a financial advisor; the administration blocks actors; stock markets are inflamed by thinning the standard earnings while buying struggling companies; and the movie contains characters who behave like adults. On other issues, like climate change, politics and class warfare, films matter more than any other.\nThere are enough caveats to cover this all.\nFirst, New York City’s strict parole system is frighteningly lenient. The city denies parole for adults arrested by police for crimes linked to a specific person’s work as a political official or judicial officer. The Corrections Department insists instead that test applicants become violent criminals. If an applicant shows signs of danger to himself or to the community, he cannot be released. That’s right — as I say, if we approve these films we’re out of mind.\nWhile, back in 2005, the New York Daily News reviewed 13 films (including one remarkably tamely titled “The Negro Chokelord,” published in 1963 and based on the 1956 Joel Smerlin book, it included stories about a sexually violent man named Tom Meyers who “would play into gangs, lure girls up for a break in, and kill them and if he could find a way, establish a school for Negro children, and confiscate his parents’ possessions.”\nBut in this case, the people who wrote the notorious Children in Need story were only hunters, as was “The Negro Chokelord.”\nGrateful, New York Daily News editors wrote, “We’ve long been concerned with violence and crime in this city’s youngest neighborhoods. We’ve created new thought processes to combat the state-sanctioned violence and criminal culture that affects the city’s neighborhoods, and it will continue to do so.”\nAlthough T3 made these observations, we suppose it would be even better if the articles were reversed. That’s why, this week, this probably won’t be the last newsworthy Bloomberg Report.\nAs the family left their house in Jersey City on Friday, the Secret Service tracked them down and caught them while they were asleep. As part of its combative investigation, the bureau pointed out that terrorists had posted extremist watch videos on their computers and downloaded of these videos from social networking sites, including YouTube. Some are real terrorists. Some simply have fled the country to avoid the police and IRS. Some of them may even go to North Korea, the most dangerous of all the terrorists. But those details are hard to overlook.\nIn fact, government agents so much wanted to cause all this turmoil, that they incorporated a crack team into the application process, filed this third Freedom of Information Act request and included them on the computer screen.\nHere’s the thing: The requirements to use the record as a benchmark are rather rigid. There’s an argument we don’t want to hear anymore.\nA paper arriving at the office posted online by Joseph Berger at the New York Times in January asked if the film made anyone more nervous. I was concerned. A literal blip.\nWe’ve all read about bad movies like Michael Crichton’s “Bjork” or Joseph R. Gordon-Levitt’s “Lawrence of Arabia.” But “Stripes of Wisdom” or “Douglas III” were my my favorite.\nAs a young student, I played card after card to represent my neighborhood. My husband was also the greatest athlete on our block, according to his ringside joke.\nBut we aren’']"
829,The Super Tuesday no one predicted a week ago,"['With only two days remaining before the GOP primaries, President Donald Trump and Democratic challengers and independent voters were salivating at the prospect of raising money to help their campaign.\nBut it was just the start of the day, as Trump accused Sanders’s Democratic opponent of trying to “turn our country into a socialist country” and called in his own candidate, Wisconsin’s Paul Ryan, to take a shot at him.\nThe latest set of developments wasn’t pleasant for the White House, which was in town to help Sanders launch his own ticket.\nAt various stages of his effort, Obama himself rallied supporters to a rally in Pennsylvania, where Obama told the crowd his divided country was “trying to turn our country into socialism.”\nCNN’s Maureen Dowd reported in an article published Monday that Obama had claimed that Sanders “can hold a major key to determining what a new country of America can look like.”\nBy that, Dowd meant Sanders.\nIf the allegation proves to be true, it would be by far the most consequential piece of evidence of the primary season that went wrong this week, CNN’s Trump claim or any other.\nAs the long weekend nears, these developments are becoming increasingly important for undecided voters, given the critical implications for the winner in a far-off presidential primary.\nThe popular Democratic Party primary gives the presumptive Republican nominee a chance to offer a bold pivot against the Republican frontrunner.\nDuring the 2012 campaign, Romney lost to President Obama by 16 percentage points. What could we glean from this situation?\nThis was not a Trump candidacy, but a Republican contest that had become about as close as the Republican race can get, in terms of demographics.\nIn 2012, in the House and Senate primaries, the Republican contenders appeared to be a coalition of Republicans and Democrats, a diverse coalition.\nThey were not the kind of coalition of Republicans and Democrats that would carry the party to a major victory in the midterm elections.\nAt the time, Obama and his team wanted to block a Bernie Sanders-led ticket from being established. And they weren’t about to let Trump become their nominee.\nBut Sanders on Tuesday said the election is also being “the result of a brand war.”\n“He said he was going to win in Michigan,” Sanders said of Trump. “He said he was going to win in Wisconsin,” Sanders said of Trump. “What he said at the time is it’s not about whether or not a Democrat wins the election,” Sanders said.\nIn all likelihood, Trump and his opponents are entirely aligned, at least a little, with the nominee. Trump is going to win the Republican nomination, the New York Times said.\nAnd Sanders isn’t the only one in the race. And the core of that race isn’t among Republicans.\nLiberal Democrats will likely be resistant to Sanders, said Robert Killeen, a law professor at Rice University and former executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform.\n“He’s an enormously popular guy, not so much politically aligned with what the Democratic Party stands for,” Killeen said. “But Sanders is too obviously big for that party.”\nClinton has never had a campaign like this, to the extent that she has been able to distract voters from her own unpopularity within the party.\nBy suggesting Sanders will beat Trump in a state with a sizable Democratic electorate, Clinton himself is saying that somehow she and Trump won’t work together.\nSanders could appear that way, if his campaign is a show of fiscal restraint while bending to popular pressure from Republicans. Trump has spent years trying to shift control of the Democratic Party away from the Republicans. And his own handlers have toned down their style, pulling left and center in a move that has energized centrist Democratic voters and the Democratic Party.\nThose who favor smaller government or greater freedom are predisposed to support Clinton, according to the most recent surveys. Sanders has repeatedly said that he and Trump could form a coalition of alliances to accomplish certain goals.\nStill, the election could yield a unique opportunity to sway the electorate in a more compromising direction.\n']"
830,Black voters know the only thing that matters,"['A study by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center says 34.2% of black voters are black, compared to 31.5% of white voters. That’s a remarkable disparity for a state that holds just 23 electoral votes and is averaging around 40 electoral votes over the past century. So where does that lead us?\n“It doesn’t surprise me. I wouldn’t call it surprising, but it certainly gives you a very strong sense of feeling and calling,” says Brokaw, who played basketball with Cheney in the 80s. “You look at Pennsylvania and Florida for instance and think about voter turnout and everything else… What could possibly go wrong?”\nThat may seem like a pipe dream, but Professor Kowalberg doesn’t see anything like it coming from middle-of-the-road voters in the GOP. “Well, the Iowa voting averages out,” he says. “Maybe a few others… but somewhere around the 26% of white voters say they don’t vote. These were pretty common.”\nWhoa, that’s a lot of people out there. Those numbers (a handful) don’t seem all that surprising – why is this a big deal when one group is responsible for the majority of demographic change in a state like Iowa, with an average of nearly 65% of its voters reporting no current Democrat or Republican in the last few years?\nPew puts it this way: 43.8% of Republican voters in Iowa went to the polls in 2016, putting them in great position for an eventual statewide contest. Then there’s Gary Burtless, the presumptive Republican nominee in Iowa who beat Democrat Chuck Grassley, 58-39, for the Senate in 2014 and added another 1.2 million votes to the caucus. The rest of the country’s electorate does the same.\nThe “other,” folks just from Iowa, that’s the other five states that haven’t managed to maintain the double-digit gains Obama achieved in 2008. He won on the red and blue lines in 2008 by 36 points, but within these five states his margin fell below 20 points – a loss that created significant resentment for Republicans.\nThat’s actually the case in South Carolina, where Joni Ernst’s formidable 8-point lead over Rand Paul fell away due to new data from a new poll from the conservative conservative Southern Institute. And the race for governor of Massachusetts is in serious jeopardy: although not super-safe, the presumptive Republican nominee is far from the worst: polls give him a 2.5% lead, and he trails Obama by 8 points.\nStill, there’s something to be said for the diversity of opinions in Iowa, even if we simply interpret that poll results to indicate a loosening of the racial nature of the population.\n“If you want to be clear and satisfying on how you’re affecting the electorate, you have to embrace very diverse demographics,” says Brokaw. “And I think that’s one of the things that has been more of a challenge than any other piece of the puzzle.”\nBut he makes good points in his comparison of battleground states. Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Wisconsin, Oregon, and Massachusetts all have historical gains of at least 20 electoral votes – a pretty large sum of support for a candidate on any given map. The success of the Democrats in states like Colorado and North Carolina, say, comes down to a much more predictable ability to control demographics, such as demographics in the Midwest, South, and Appalachia.\nWhether that means that Iowa does have the second-fastest growing racial electorate in a major population group, or that some of the country’s rural areas – left mostly by professionals – somehow lag behind, Brokaw is certain that Iowa will win its first major presidential race.\n“If you have to deal with a white population in a very rural state like Iowa, then that won’t be an issue,” he says. “In fact, they’re pretty young, and all of a sudden they’re in control. I think that’s a pretty interesting phenomenon, because it appears it’s still changing.”\n']"
831,Warren Buffett has the right answer to crony capitalism: women (opinion),"['If you call the really bottom-10% of people, you’re going to catch your breath.\nA very depressing study (pdf) commissioned by Warren Buffett, stock manipulation, and other trendy predictions for the future, all takes place against this backdrop. On a simple point, it sounds exactly as bad news.\nOne has to imagine some sort of logic in the audience’s reaction to the idea of funding female scientists who are actively on behalf of the government because they want a little piece of why capitalism works.\n“Put something in the price of a company, and it is highly profitable,” the article quoted Buffett. But more often than not, a company must sell in order to receive a profit.\nIn other words, if women CEOs had to work more to their benefit, there would be less competition. That is the premise behind some of the biggest paid media industries today. But as Buffett pointed out, just because your CEO pays less than your “golden cows” does not mean that her employees are.\n“And she really would be more effective with fewer new hires if the company was simultaneously reopening” an intellectual minefield which the American economy and business talk about.\nNo, those press pundits are just understating the absurd scale of the problem.\nOn the surface, women now make up 90% of the nation’s entrepreneurs, and they provide an incredible amount of profits, the typical CEO pays a whopping 15,000 people 1.5 times the average salary of women. The pay gap is predicted to widen more than a trillion dollars by 2040 if women don’t find opportunities to partner or invest with their friends.\nThe simple way out of this inequality seems to be to move from an industry as creative and exciting as Facebook to an ever-changing class of businesses: education, careers, work, family, and anything else that’s at hand.\nA diverse workforce or a company that offers an unparalleled range of services makes that list impossible to ignore.\nThe vast majority of companies continue to employ people who are married, whose mothers are secretaries or teachers, and have a professional relationship.\n(Women take home about $50,000 less than men, according to a 2016 global survey.)\nWhatever your reasons for wanting business to move forward, make sure your company has women in mind for its future expansion. Already they’re tackling issues like military academies and the over-reliance on minorities in major fields like manufacturing, transportation, and construction.\nAlso, introduce the technology sector to the kind of people who would dare to put money where their mouth is, leading to the arrival of robots, pipelines, broadband networks, and other labor-saving ideas that can fill a decade’s worth of jobs.\nThe whole purpose of the Dodd-Frank financial reform system is to make sure people aren’t trapped in the corridors of power.\nThis article was written by my partner at Jeffs & Sidell, who is an investor in the world of marketplaces and invests in the best value companies.\n']"

And then you discover, like the former social media user here, she took the time to fight back, publicly hammering her old boss off of Facebook. People don’t understand what kind of chaos there can be online or what it’s like to move forward because of the “fanati.”\nMixed in there is the tendency to smack people off the ledge of social networks by excoriating them for perceived ill will, and the quick — and tempting — turn away the object of their scorn at all costs.\nOn the surface, the one thing we’ve learned, in surveys carried out by CNN, is that as long as we can’t escape the healthy sense of social media balance — that when we want our updates, tweets, and most importantly Instagram postings to be easily shared safely, as opposed to constantly updating them with what we decide were misleading information, we may as well crack open a bottle and cuddle up to each other.\nBut that doesn’t mean we’re all reliant on our personal and personal interests to stay in the best light.\nIt’s easy to be happy online. We have a lot of photos of our kids, vacation photos, and, for several weeks, we have a lot of feeling of so much fun back-to-back and so many ways we can mingle with one another.\nEven while we’re distracted and gossipy, an ill-defined “social media friendly” reality can have other messages that cause you to be an even more fickle customer.\nEveryone would much rather have “real” social media likes and connections and have the occasional pool of Facebook friends.\nSo many people are searching for their first real contact, but we can always turn to filters to get past these red flags or dispel gossip.\nYes, we know when we’re missing that feeling of “outside the mainstream” — we have our website, we love to be photographed, we’re happy to be given a free event and we work insanely hard to tell our kids how we feel.\nBut, does that really mean “social media friendly” is everything that we need to have or should be?\nMany people feel they need to gain access to these functions. They wish they could do that, but honestly, it depends on how far they try. We get so used to social media interactions that we do a constant spin on where to go and what to do in general, but what if they’re lonely? What if they’re lonely? How should they stay from being captured by other people?\nSocial media strategy never goes entirely wrong. In an ideal world, we would want to continuously be safe, but if we were to inadvertently create social media friendships with strangers, we’d be fighting away from each other.\nEveryone has a different perspective when it comes to giving up their selfie, sharing their dog, or engaging in social media chat. It’s tricky to let go of that aggression, but I’d give it one hell of a try.\n']"
833,The trade war put the economy on its heels. The coronavirus will be much worse (opinion),"['The aorta may have passed from one side to the other, but it’s about to get an almost certain edge in the rest of its life.\nThe clearest indication yet that The ITTF War That Is going on has positioned its economy for higher growth this year and beyond. One of the strongest cash grabs of the year happened at Sino chipmaker Intel this week, acquiring IS Commerce and the IS Commerce Server, a division of the larger and more valuable PlusNote Corporation, for $1.2 billion.\nImagine a country in the middle of its economy and suddenly there’s gone a significant number of jobs and currency – or jobs, or jobs, or jobs – in that, to use one of the twin terms of the Standard and Poor’s Simple Readiness Index, and the Commerce Department just filed its 2018 confidence-booster.\nAs far as I know, the United States still owns the world’s most expensive credit card. There are a whole bunch of others and it seems like you’d be prepared to lose a race with Canada.\nStill, the main thing they’re going after is arguably more insidious than the SHI argument that never was, but it still might be.\nAccording to the U.S.’s most recent two-year construction index – the one we’re in the middle of – the biggest increase is toward the low end of the range that has economists fretting (again) about.\nWith fewer Americans, more Americans “committed to giving up substantial government programs … a quick move away from a balanced budget in 2019 and past years is very likely to push financial markets into recession later in the year,” says Elazar Mizrus, a global vice president of institutional economics at Barclays Barclays.\nIt’s that likely demand for fewer government programs than the official figures suggest. But it’s more likely inflation than foregone dollars is going up, a noticeable shift that would leave the average citizen in better demand for government services — including the financial services portion of the GDP.\n']"

835,"If my campus closes down, my job could go with it","['I am at the high school of the week. (Don’t forget it was only a month ago.) I’ve been in the ninth grade. It seems my mid-grade computer programming plans with the kids from my high school have to sit for half a month before everyone takes a break. Any time to pause for a few days I like to edit stuff so there are slightly fewer hours to edit the next one. This school is going to close and my best guess is that it is going to just stay closed for a little while.\nI usually check my homework at 11 in the morning. Now, it’s 10 on the morning of April 5. I usually check it out. Sometimes I wake up at 2 a.m. to watch television or hear whatever music they’re going to come up with a night before until 1 a.m. (as if from left field) so that I have two chances to copy and practice something. This is not always my best day. Sometimes I’ll check out of the office in the morning before sunrise, and that usually leaves me just staring at my computer screen with a blackening spot where my fingers begin to wilt.\nWhenever this happens, I grab my phone and hang up. I scroll around until midnight and catch up to what my mom says: “The post-graduation nap is about one hour before we have to do this forever!”\nIt’s strange when I get out of the house and I can’t see an emergency cellphone in my hand. But I catch up with my friends at 10 a.m. I don’t need to at night, and I don’t need to ever check my email for all the stuff on the phone. So I take the day off. Then when I woke up I could barely figure out what I was doing for five minutes with this mess of articles about getting it right in my head. I worry that someone will screw up my account, or that things will get automated and we will all be people exposed to a lot of nasty behavior.\nNow that all the electronic circuit boards have gone into effect in all schools, I take up something fun for the kids, like sculpting, spinning and dog-and-chip puppets. I’m going to see an installation tomorrow called “The Fountains of Fountains.”\nI know how much I love watching these things, it’s the biggest thrill I get getting to watch them. How long can I let them do this? How long can they take to learn? Are they going to use some kind of language when you ask them to use the words “stuff”? Are they going to make slimeballs to destroy the steel box that will come out of this thing?\nThis book in which I talk with my friends about the travelogues has helped me learn some basic footnotes, what they might be turning up their noses at before it actually happens. This shows that the constant lag between lectures and homework has taught me some basic skills in the sub-dialectical realm that I am still learning today. It also seems that while it might have been some new fun once I have completed my 10 on the morning of April 5, learning to correct spelling mistakes and explain media bills can be a little more tedious. This is certainly not my first semester to try this theory of civics. I just did it once.\nThis article appeared on book_editing.org\n']"
836,The popularity of 'Love Is Blind' reveals what we're missing in our lives,"['Dear friend: Dear friend, I just want to help the gay community. I have to tell you that I live in Chicago and … too many friends all over America think that we are condemned to be captives to far-flung ideas that on one level meet social conventions.\nWell, apparently so. According to the latest edition of American Psycho magazine, which just made up a cover story for HBO\'s upcoming sex horror series that is set to premiere later this year, \'Love Is Blind\' is their annual phenomenon.\nWe want to thank God for telling us this. We also want to thank you, the magazine, for revealing what makes the gay community so captivating and endearing to the world. Because, this is why, in the aftermath of the sexual harassment scandal that roiled Hollywood this spring, the only thing left for the LGBTQ community to do was rise up and hit the reset button with its members.\nThe magazine details exactly how they got this treatment and what they did to improve the situation. Apparently, Charlie Huston, legendary writer and producer, began the fight by talking about the subject in no uncertain terms in the first paragraph of the magazine article. Among the revelations included Huston\'s use of ""fake,"" ""fake-or-offend,"" ""le"" and ""silent"" pronouns, thereby allowing homosexuality to be referred to and improving the situation. In his inimitable wisdom, writer Huston, unafraid to use any form of non-conformist language, suggested that gay men should be openly confronted with the truths of their sexual orientation, including conceiving of a child with someone else.\nDuring the article, Huston explained why he chose to use the word ""faggot"" with pride. He explains: ""If I\'ve had my day in courts, I know that speech matters a lot for people in their own state of mind. And obviously you can speak of being homosexual, but that doesn\'t matter because they are destroying you, because they are destroying your future.""\nHuston also argued in response to the responses of various community members, including his own political views, that there were men in the gay community who were looking out for their own homes and were erecting homes to be filled with gay men.\nQuite an effort and largely directed at the entertainment industry, the AIDS crisis was particularly significant in the context of gay rights. In his piece about the struggles against the AIDS virus, Huston suggested that it was all because Hollywood, instead of their \'bunny vibes\' promoting issues, was engaged in a glorification of a largely marginalized community on the gay/lesbian/bi/LGBT space.\nThe presence of such a dishonest white, free-wheeling media climate in light of Hollywood\'s insistence to protect its own homo sapiens by challenging the \'bunny vibes\' is quite damning. For Huston, gay and transgender people - who the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation is protesting as being ""hostile"" to the ""bunny vibes"" - are well aware of the problems and this is why they reacted so ferociously. And therein lies the problem with the gay community. Because, the gay community is not surrounded by a white, free-wheeling media environment.\nHuston\'s article, while detailing the challenges faced by its members, is meant to illustrate the fact that sexual exploitation is not only a problem affecting heterosexuals, it is even affecting gay people.\nThe story also makes clear that the bottom line is that the gay community has been marginalised, neglected and demonised by Hollywood which in turn has driven the gay community to take its own destinies. Because such divisive language of lust and violation have done nothing to uplift the trans community or women; instead they have been used as scapegoats which unfortunately attempt to manipulate the LGBT community into believing that things are not easy for them.\nWhile it is entirely acceptable that gay people can be critically held and embattled by the BGLA-operated media which is patronising, this kind of pseudo-pleasure only creates a fantasy space for hostile outsiders who want to protect the ""s***s"" from themselves, or any other group of individuals who has little to lose by resorting to such extreme language.\nThis is a world where homophobia is defined by its perpetuation. And it\'s precisely this really sad kind of group that is able to justify and subvert its form of intolerance to what it perceives as opportunity.\nThank God for the success that you have had with \'Love Is Blind\'.\n']"

841,Coronavirus decisions creates big burden for college students,"['Cofounder of KeepYourHealthUS.com and author Aaron Feis said you’ve probably had a difficult time understanding how to prevent contracting the infectious viral disease cryptosporidiosis (CPK).\nCPK is a disease caused by a virus, usually from a central nervous system infection, which is so powerful that it spreads through the air, causing a milder respiratory disease and psychological shock.\n“It’s not directly a serious cause,” he said. “Its more of a direct consequence of the fact that you don’t necessarily care about making sure you’re testing yourself, but you actually make sure you’re studying properly. It makes us really sad.”\nBut Feis said it helps the student know exactly where their body is at the moment of infection. If it’s more than two hours into his work, he makes sure all their respiratory symptoms are recorded and they are tracked by computers.\nThat simple and unobtrusive biopsy doesn’t keep somebody from becoming infected, but it requires two years to collect, track and evaluate the person before entering the campus.\nAnd he said many students realize the sooner they do that, the better they do.\n“That’s where the public health community starts to come in,” he said. “You want to get people back on their feet and be at ease. People tend to be in these situations at higher risk because, of course, they can’t possibly do any strenuous physical activity to be afraid of it.\n“And that’s great news, because it gives them time to get back on track with their physical activity.”\nOne of the biggest symptoms that CPK can cause is fever. To prevent it, people first think of it as a fever and those symptoms usually end up being problems such as irritable bowel syndrome, unexplained chest pain, nausea and vomiting.\nAbout 75 percent of people with cryptosporidiosis die from it, although don’t worry about finding out through names, friends or family.\nCPK can be carried by people with immune-suppressing bacteria, and in fact, is called porcine enterovirus dorsolateralus, which is what causes the disease, according to Doctors Without Borders.\nSome people with cryptosporidiosis can develop diarrhea and even a strong cough and cough that kill them immediately.\nThe diseases generally begin as early as the middle of March, so they typically last for around the first few weeks of summer. People can get symptoms during the most recent year from a few days prior to their day of work.\nDon’t get caught.\nPeople who are infected may leave the clinic immediately if there is any significant fever or discomfort in their arms or legs. People infected, usually couples or pre-existing health conditions, may require medical supervision or that they cannot get help.\nIf you have a family member with PID, DO NOT contact your health care provider. PID is a new infection that doesn’t have a history of development yet so there is no way for you to tell that you’ve been infected. It’s common for patients with PID to have symptoms which doesn’t stop them from having PID symptoms that cause them to have an increased chance of contracting the disease.\n“Those symptoms can last from three weeks to 30 days and they often are not symptoms that you see in a normal person, but they are markers that work in the body that show your need for treatment,” he said.\nAs for being an entirely human being, it’s easy to forget this in a college setting.\n“I do think we come to understand that you need to be one of the cautious ones and think, \'Can I go through this knowing I have a disease that I can’t help?\'” he said. “How do you prepare yourself before you go to school to make sure you are as vigilant about your health?\n“Let’s face it, when we come in, we’re always there to get something that we might not be healthy for and we always think, \'This is going to be one of these.\'""\n']"
842,How to improve your chances against coronavirus,"['Recent research has shown that deadly coronavirus viruses like Clostridium difficile and C. difficile can survive more than three years without becoming public health threats.\nNow a US-based computer-aided-diagnosis team, led by former geneticist Andrew Wakefield, has developed a way to track the flu symptoms of HIV infection.\nThe virus is already in the medical arena and into real life. So how should you approach this tricky management?\nRemember the “bunny spots?”\nMany viral strains have been discovered in people’s lives in the past. These include Clostridium difficile and C. difficile.\nWhat happens to virus A viruses and the E virus? (a distinct antigen, which means you don’t like what’s in your body.) And how do you know the virus A has caught the bug and isn’t developing more lethal infections?\nThe virus A is an antigen that has been used in a variety of products, like droppings for homeless dogs, lawnmowers and skiing equipment.\nClostridium difficile can thrive for about three years, and how long does that stretch? By our estimates, over three years.\nIn their book “Guiding Cybersecurity : Two Ways to assess and Protect against Clostridium difficile,” research team leader Anil Patel, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, offers three key ways to fight the virus:\nDiagnostic is a tool, but it is only a limited tool. It is important to monitor the virus’s activity to make sure it’s tracking the vaccine efficacy for vaccine candidates. In the next step, Patel and his colleagues applied the same search to identifying new genetic codes for protein groups in how the virus types can evolve. “If we can isolate the protein groups and improve on them, then we can continue to test new strains. We can use this to find gene mutation-lovers. Our interpretation of this may also enable us to recreate genetic changes in other groups of viruses in an environment that offers better immunity,” says Patel.\nEarly detection helps\nThe team developed the SIMON1 laboratory device, which aggregates two layers of a virus group measuring a visitor’s blood, the germ line, and the threshold for testing the symptoms. The two layers are then scanned by an infrared camera, keeping in view the virus’s presence and then counting the Ebola virus as it moves between the two layers. It has developed a way to determine precisely the virus within each case, thanks to its camorbatic properties.\nAlarmingly, one of the team’s findings was that one of the seven strains whose virus-fighting test had emerged 20 days earlier in the virus lineage, was five times more potent than Clostridium difficile. And it’s likely much more effective.\nTo prevent illness, the researchers also wanted to collect the viruses using ECG scanning and lung CT scans. This allows them to conduct a pilot study to determine whether each other in the sample will suffer severe allergic reaction if they are exposed to Clostridium difficile.\nThe way to beat the virus\nIt’s also important to understand why the flu virus is so effective against Clostridium difficile. Adverse reactions such as the viral diarrhoea and vomiting, often caused by the germ, can kill an even more innocent viral strain of Clostridium difficile, “because Clostridium in itself is linked to drug toxicity,” says Patel.\n“The influenza pandemic of 1918 ultimately caused thousands of deaths from disease caused by Clostridium difficile (clostridium difficile) in what would have been estimated to be a serious public health emergency,” Patel adds. “Now it’s showing that we should be looking at doing even more urgently and thoroughly.”\n']"
843,A common-sense approach to coronavirus crisis,"['It’s the same battle each year in this time of crisis for hepatitis C, A.P.H. – commonly known as coronavirus or even Norvirus – in which scientists face a crisis of the brightest minds. The first known deaths of coronavirus patients began in 2003, and peak cases began in 2008.\nWe now know that this scourge of hepatitis C is a constant concern for the doctors and nurses who care for it.\nAmong other researchers, P. Moy is currently working on designing a new vaccine (currently the only one available to treat people of hepatitis C, which has infected more than 5 million people globally and infects more than 1.3 million people worldwide).\nUnable to provide a vaccine to replace frontline staff who failed to receive necessary samples, the team is working with Stanford University on a new vaccine. In December 2012, UCSF and Hackensack University Medical Center scientists discovered, they have one unique possibility for initiating a vaccine with essential protection against viruses originating in the virus’ contacts – the mosquitoes that act like parasites that carry microvirus, the parasites that are even more virulent and are especially protective against the virus that causes Norvirus.\nIn order to begin to identify the one organization that can produce a vaccine, the team asked UCSF and Hackensack to conduct a test tube test for mosquitos grown in fish ponds and tracks the mosquitos on laptops. The mosquitos would be tested for parasites, and then Zika virus virus, or Zika E.\nThe team found an abundance of mosquitos, which were transported to laboratories in California, where they were also tested to be effective in effectively infecting people with certain viruses, the team found.\nNot every mosquito toxin is capable of causing birth defects, but both polio and HPV viruses can help and impair the prevention of diseases like cancer, stomach cancer, and foot ulcers, said study lead author Dr. Lloyd Andreoux, an infectious disease specialist at Stanford’s Huber Medical Center.\nThat “demand” for vaccines, and that “demand” itself led the team to develop a new molecule that somehow would offer a potential host of human pathogens capable of causing disease-causing parasites and many other sorts of infections, the team found.\nThis material was published in the April 5 issue of the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.\n']"

These are boring books. Characters must be dead.\nSure, some of the individuals on these series, though, can be loyal allies to humans who are embroiled in criminal activity, like the guy on the waiting list for the hospital-access slot for a guy that was supposed to get his special implants, thus justifying his previous role as a lowly celebrity chef.\nBut, our version of the story, by the way, doesn’t function as a plot device as much as it does the same thing at every turn. Some characters just suck their teeth into each other’s high-tech gear.\nWhat’s better is the idea that it’s all about two heroes on the same thing, combined, that the plots in each series basically don’t mention too much.\nTheir logical pairing is why we should care about two of these shows. And we should care about their fictional characters as well, too.\n']"
845,Melinda Gates: The women who showed me the way forward,"['I’m not saying I know the women who are doing the best thing possible, but I’m saying that they’re the kind of influence who I want to recognize. They were among the people working towards the feminist agenda that was at the core of my success growing up in New York.\nThey made it possible for me to organize around, not only the progressive labor movement, but the women of the world that needed so much help to advance their agenda in a progressive way.\nAs I’ve written:\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\nAnd continue:\nA key takeaway from reading those blogs, that is, is to know the women who represent you.\nThose women were the ones with no other choice.\nThey put the third rail, you know, in politics. Not conservatives. Republicans and Democrats have had no choice but to change the stuff they’re trying to do by promoting egalitarianism and for Americans to become more committed to the political system and to having more female politicians.\nEleanor Roosevelt, though, could not close the door on equality and we should not find ourselves ambivalent about it. FDR taught us, in a very direct fashion, the most important lessons, and the children of the day, whether you were white or male, and what I learned was that this is nothing but the manifestation of the ethos of truth and principle.\nMoreover, it wasn’t class. Democrats were supportive of racial equality. The United States was the envy of the world.\nThe popular media isn’t Jewish, nor is the Democratic Party, nor the Conservative, or even the liberal left. We all know that our people can get along, for a few reasons. One is that there’s a populist energy to the movement and it’s this aspect of the party that I associate with matters of ethics and morals. It’s usually rooted in the ideas of a particular faction of feminism or the gender movement or something we see as human beings should be able to get along without problem.\nBut as liberals we’re all just beginning to see the great strengths that exist as opposed to the wisest things of the past. They want to create fresh ideas that don’t really come from those points of view, which they’ve rarely been able to find unless they feel that special is what’s most important.\nYet, Democrats for years argued that they should have been more progressive. Unlike progressives, they understood that progressive economics was an inevitable reality in a time of income inequality and stagnant wages. They argued that having a woman as part of the progressive agenda was the perfect stepping stone.\nAnd then they helped launch the feminist movement and pushed it back.\nFinally, the moral compass wasn’t so strong on the Left’s side. It did not fit squarely in the hand of others. It fit happily in the actions of the Times, on the other hand, which was trying to get our attention and mandate more openness with a more mainstream liberal agenda.\nA new generation of people was beginning to express their appreciation for, and support for, it. Hillary Clinton was the change agent of the progressive movement. Bernie Sanders served as the defenders of that agenda, on civil rights and women’s issues. Donald Trump was not America’s nominee, either.\nAnd then the influence of these women took root and encouraged the movement to make the dream of racial equality a reality in the American society. It wasn’t an easy task.\nThese women have been crucial players in generations of change. Beyond that, they’ve been tireless in providing reliable guidance and mentoring to those who chose to challenge them on their own terms.\n']"
846,We're not talking to our girls enough about money (opinion),"['As we all know, money is scary for young women because you basically just have to put on a pair of jeans and get out into the real world. This includes feeling a little pouty and being tempted to squabble with a guy over a haircut, any meal that we have planned or credit cards that we can afford, loans that will “eventually kick in,” letting our kids “drop off” our bills, a wealth of government programs that will charge us to park our cars and send our check through the ATM that’s supposed to hook us up with your old e-mail address.\nI’m married and have a child. I’m being anxious for a life beyond my young kids, which is an understatement! Being hyper all day, every day, looking out for one another, dreaming that one of them might be having a “birthday,” in other words.\nAnd being “usually careful” about what we buy for ourselves.\nNothing I buy will get me sick or get me honest.\nMy skin is new and I’m growing it in at a super rapid pace, in order to prevent skin diseases that may soon be peep-cbeding me in a hurry. The hardest thing I’ve ever gotten to deal with is I’m so afraid to shave. I’m almost in a little panic mode, and I’m wondering why I was hiding my vagina in my wardrobe and thinking it’s cancer hot under the collar in the middle of nowhere. I’m just trying to protect and watch her dance and make her laugh.\nOK, my foreskin is protecting me.\nBut also I’m concerned about who is going to get the lot, if one of the ladies wants to pin him down at dinner, and who gets to say “Welcome to the cottage cottage” and the last time they saw me, right before she came off and threw one of these, what they won’t be doing, what the rucksack (what? What the hell is this on? I know it’s not messed up, but apparently her booty is quite getting wet)… has he felt empowered with those damn jeans as well?\nThat little butt pain or tightness? The yelp of “I’m good!” or the alarm of “Let’s go. Let’s go; let’s go, let’s go!” The fear that creeps up on you like this, the need to decide who’s going to be given the “nipple”; which one will be given if one of them is looking attractive or attractive and sexy or sexy and sexy, or not being attractive. Or not wearing shoes for a while; you know what they’re talking about.\nWhat I mean, there have been times where that’s been the best part of my job. There have been times when that’s been the worst.\nSo when I become pregnant my legs are the easiest and clearest. How can I be a “crazy stalker” if I aren’t supposed to care?\nI’m pretty damn serious about looking good. Is I taking any of my clothes off or glossing up? Oh, I am, but I am who I am! So that’s how I was never able to decide who I really was?\n']"

That’s the kind of assumption struck by Vivek Murthy, former CEO of the chip giant Intel and a host of tech leaders when they chatted with CNN’s Chris Cuomo on CNN Business Thursday. “It’s just a really weird notion,” Murthy said in discussing the latest environment for the far-out approach taken by officials in Japan. “We have very competent people working on this, and for that I have to say, give us a little credit.” Still, though, Murthy thinks that Trump should have another opportunity to fight back against Japan’s almost subservient military posture.\nThe continental United States is being “no longer a regional land mass, a peripheral but also global center,” Murthy said. “That fact is coming up short for Japan and the rest of the East Asian region,” he said. “Japan is the center of the scale,” Murthy said. “And the rest of the East Asian region is getting its teeth into and working down the Japanese side. … It’s very, very unsettling to be dealing with somebody who has never been to Japan, who always acknowledges that there may be tremendous problems going on.” He thinks that should be a “great subject for a different style of political discussion,” noting that much like the Tokyo Olympics debacle, the ongoing story of what’s actually going on in the East Asia’s No. 2 economy goes well beyond Japan’s borders.\nUpdate: The Washington Post has updated its story with the background on the ongoing story. It’s a bit unclear why Murthy is speaking.\n']"
848,The big question about 'West Side Story',"['That chance to show wry emotions that are not easily apparent right from the start makes Kenneth Turan’s history of classic stories so brilliant. ""West Side Story"" is that big, 1970s populist romanticized fun that should come as no surprise, and it does. So something so pompous, so true-crime-softens the protagonist in the third act when he leads the tortured, failed romance of Jacob and Meri through great slights, heartbreak and cheat-downs.\nTuran’s staging — American musical numbers available on iTunes — are so grand and delicate that the judges even loved them. They particularly loved the holiday number for where the characters lives. And for being so sentimental — there’s more to the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical than a refrain about ""never"" — that makes every time the show gets the best of it. Why? Because in these rooms, every time we see the subtle presence of the identity of the characters, we see their steadfastness and struggle. It’s priceless.\nBut sometimes, the story takes a real turn. In ""West Side Story,"" for example, a baby begins to suffer from underlying Sysysys allergies. The poor guy was the right guy, in every way. And in ""West Side Story,"" that parent angst is at the center of the entire experience.\nSysyses get better with age, as young characters grow up and become agents of their own kind. Time is wasted, though, and the Youngsters — ages 6 to 13 — are too old for what they care about and enjoy. How else do you explain the power of wordlessly pumping into an 80-page piece of free entertainment, without having to commit in half-price tickets? Oh, and that soundtrack is extraordinary. The Rialto is an excellent production, if unconventional for this generation (even more effective with its score, and accessible to the newcomers, than the full-blown Broadway show ""All the Way"").\n----------\n""West Side Story"" runs through June 11. 7:30 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 3 p.m. Sundays. $12 at advance, $10 at the door.

She was such a talented woman, whose death affects so many of us, from colleagues to students, from community members to donors.”\nThe community responded to the news by asking those who knew the Harwick family to “give back to the little children in our community.”\nStories like this one will be constantly present.\nIt all starts with “you tell me I loved you and I’ll tell you I loved you,” Harwick’s sister Aileen Hutchings said in an interview with CNN affiliate WKRN.\n“I will never forget when she walked into my office in town and her chin got up and she’s got my hand down and she brought my teeth out of their teeth. ‘Mr. Harwick,’ she said.”\n“It’s true. We’re just standing there feeling upset. She was good-looking and she knew everybody well, and she knew what to say and didn’t need to say anything.”\nHutchings said Harwick’s family, together with others, have been lending their voice to public service.\n“Just yesterday we went to the funeral, and someone at the funeral said they have people from the community coming, and they’re doing a lot of service from the community,” she said. “We’re talking about the people on the street that would be the same regardless of who is doing what.”\nWhile Harwick’s death is a tragic and tragic incident, it still resonates, especially to the community of Columbia.\n“I would hope and pray that the angels (are) not sending anybody who happened to be in this area — and especially in the Circuit Court house — into a murder,” Hutchings said. “That’s something she’s dedicated to every day and so many other ladies and family members who love her are hurting right now.”\nThe Virginia City Police Department, who investigated Harwick’s death as a homicide, said in a press release: “We have received media reports from around the globe and news organizations that depict a double murder involving multiple individuals in central Virginia, occurring in either downtown Columbia or within south Petersburg, North Petersburg, Robert Wood Johnson, Frederick Miller and Virginia City.”\nThat in addition to deliberate vandalism, “circumstances clearly suggest that this individual could have murdered those involved in the murder,” the release said.\nThe assailants were identified as Robert and Christina Brown and arrested on August 1st, 2017.

851,Harvey Weinstein is convicted. Now what?,"['Most people and institutions are an unpleasant bunch, but they can also be a positive force. The reason you won’t notice or raise a fuss is because they’re thinking people are in denial. They think that these people are screwing around and it’s all about money, but what they really mean is that if you’re a big deal and these are people you should be outraged.\nOh, and still and this :\nWeinstein was convicted Wednesday on three felony counts of harassment, which came to light in 2016 after the National Enquirer published an anonymous letter detailing allegations of Weinstein dabbling in personal relationships with other women. Now we know: Weinstein is still behind bars! … and the chaos will only intensify once he’s free. “Once Mr. Weinstein serves his punishment,” a law-enforcement source said, “the specific charges of harassment won’t come into effect until he is 30 years in prison.” … Anyone else feel feel free to write about “harassment.”\nThe chutzpah of that statement is inexplicable. In this regard, it’s clear: If we’re going to post a message across the Internet in our favor, we’re going to post a message that stings. Why not mention it in case we don’t want the world to get caught in the light? …\nAdditionally, this is a deeply worrying aspect of anti-trust laws, right? If they’re not cool with some sort of recognition of “unfair competition,” they’re really kicking ourselves. And, frankly, people should talk about what is a regrettable subject and not be ashamed of it. It’s about securing a larger definition of “fair and just competition” that includes both the rejection of unfair barriers of entry and reward schemes. Any other thing might be considered unfair competition. But that’s a legal matter. It certainly doesn’t mean that requiring incentives to buy into societal norms (“dignity”) and “winners” respect unfair competition or “traditional institutions” don’t have the right to control information flow.\nThat certainly doesn’t bode well for the defending of rights, which are women’s rights. The next step must be an apology.\nOne of the government’s most ineffective ways to settle a conviction is suing people who get it wrong in court. The Americans With Disabilities Act failed, and this latest injustice is for the very worst. It takes the burden off of an individual to take a stand, as protectionism threatens power and competition, and making rules can only be the opposite of promoting their interests.\n']"

854,I was raped and broken. So I picked up my camera,"['When I was growing up in Alexandria, Virginia, no matter what my mother told me that I was too thin to be abused anymore, I never felt that way, and my friend, who was also pregnant at the time, never reported it to police. While I was only a child of 8 years old, my mom constantly spoke of my innocence, reminding me of the five of us in trouble. My mom had mentioned that the land where we lived was under sanctions against her for having poor eyesight and, so, my mother convinced my dad to do the same. In the midst of the abstinence campaign, my best friend teased me when I was younger, teasing and teasing her throughout her entire life. When I was ten years old, she wanted to push me out of my home state for fighting with her boyfriend. She was always joking around and told me to keep my mouth shut. I followed her advice when I was five years old.\nMy mother often told me what was really going on with me: “Pick a fight in class, bitch.” In return, I’d promise I would just make my boyfriend happy, but that didn’t last long. I once called her (mostly with a pretty smile) a “crazy bitch.” Whenever I showed up on stage, I pretended I wasn’t in trouble and said that I was treated like that too. I didn’t tell her about that, just the show that I was performing and she was thrilled with me. And when that one made the news, my mom knew what it was like to be in a room full of girls. I’d been there many times and planned on waiting until they started filming so that I could escape, but by then my mom was terrified, mostly because she knew I was probably being abused. That seemed impossible to stop.\nWhen my mother came home, even though she knew that I was a difficult and vulnerable person, I was probably too emotionally unstable to say anything about it. By that time, she would finally direct me toward something constructive: contacting the police. I decided I’d try my best to avoid the police altogether. I honestly was surprised that they still treated me like a child at all, when I was a child and somewhat vulnerable as a child. It turns out that if I ever told anyone I was going to do anything wrong, they’d be so much more likely to lash out than help me. I went on to have a good relationship with them and each time, they’d treat me like a person. My mother never told me that I was reaching for the “toys” in the toys she was making with my hands. She always addressed me as “normal” and tried to scare me away from them. Even though I had a strong sexual desire, she tried to help me. I always shared her feelings (like I wanted to be a girl) so I wouldn’t be seen as insecure as her. I never got the attention she wanted me to get. It hurt so bad that I never gave her another compliment to call her a “y” (that’s like “kookaa hoon”), but I did express my discomfort to her over time. I learned to say things like, “If you hate me, then you hate me,” and “I’m not my own worst enemy.”\nThe fear that I went to such a mental hospital to deal with that I shouldn’t be allowed to represent myself to a relative, like the man who abused me when I was little and wanted me to be nothing like him (and he was already a beautiful son). I wanted to be called “Aye” or “justa peja” or my mom simply as that. I had to climb into that room in awe of that experience.\nIronically, all those years later, my mother is now cancer free, and I’m so glad she survived.\n']"

857,Asheville's woes are the story of America,"['NEW YORK – The story is hazy.\nPopularity continues to be humbling.\nHow do you navigate the turbulence of truth, fairness, honor, democracy, and question?\nWhen there’s little daylight between John F. Kennedy’s bid to turn his nation’s socialist movement into a critical mass, he and much of the country have quietly carried on his basic rhetoric.\nBut, the president’s “thank you,” whispered through a steel cage during the first half of the campaign, and “every breath I took,” and “governing is for the people” aren’t answers to the problems that nags President Lincoln.\nAt the end of the campaign, the new president blamed the Kansas Democratic Party for trying to “pull Americans out of their bombs” as a sign of his being “un-presidential.”\nThe future looks ugly, but even that is real, because it will be hard for Lincoln to imagine a government that never departed that way.\nRepublican social theorists urged Lincoln not to go to sleep at night.\nBut he did, and when Trump seemed daunted, and even confused, Kennedy crowed of the “beautiful soul of the people,” he came to the country with a certain sense of victory.\n']"
858,Fractured America got together on this issue. And it could point the way for more,"['When I served as the legislative director for the Iowa Republican Party, I started noticing, up to then, quite a few people on the right, some of them coming to me, to say things like “We want to be looked at more respectfully.” People, they were marching, and they would start with things like, “President Trump and House Republicans are being too divisive with one another,” or “It’s time to open the floodgates and give the moderates in Congress more options.” As when I explained to Senator Young something like “We do think (he) ought to look at ways to get conservatives to the table for conservative compromises.”\nBut I also noticed that a little bit, knowing folks I didn’t know. And I also noticed some “Instincters” I knew. A few of them who told me, for example, about the failed Romney-Ryan arrangement during the Republican primaries, and other candidates. When I asked for opinions, then-GOP primary voters said, “She’s gross.” I mean, was it mean? Was she mean? Didn’t he kiss her kiss a lot before the primary? He’s just not good at what we do.\nThe truth is, a lot of these people, a lot of them, coming from high-pressure lists of who they know, high-powered people like me, come from pretty high places. They know how to run their own companies. They know how to get their own bank accounts. They know how to run a business. They know how to run their company as a husband and father. And they’re just excited about being looked at more respectfully.\nI think that that’s what’s most important here. Not having anybody standing up against Trump, when he is praising or vilifying a Republican running for president who openly peddles his theories that minorities make up this country’s poor, with his calls for closing the borders to illegal immigrants and not hurting families, and more. That’s what’s more important here than a team trying to do this kind of foolishness, on a very short notice. They’re ready to use their leverage, and they’re not going to hesitate.\nThese folks are ready. They’re part of a bipartisan group here. They’re serious. And they’re so good at it they’re willing to overlook the flaws of their own party.\nThe issues they want to deal with, even though they might get one or two votes (to be more likely than Republicans) to do it, are vastly different. They want to fix the problems. They’re not going to trade ideas for the most unpopular ideas. They want their ideas to change in a genuine way, to bring the American people into line, rather than fragmenting the party and wrecking every congressional re-election in the country for a single week.\nSo, in the years ahead, I think they’ll start talking about things like, “We want to be looked at more respectfully.” I think they’ll start thinking, “It’s time to open the floodgates and give the moderates more options.”\n']"
859,Conservative: She was not a faceless liberal,"['President Trump loves to claim he’s not a small-government liberal. But my jaw dropped when I read the recent e-mail from the White House claiming the president is “proud” of his leadership position on the federal debt.\n“Trump was elected to run an independent government,” he wrote. “He is ‘proud’ that we are the 25th largest government government and spends big dollars on foreign benefits and unnecessary subsidies to foreign countries.”\nMore importantly, his presidency, which began in 2001, is “responsible” for cutting $100 billion from the nation’s national debt this year alone.\nAs many have already read, Trump is building a massive wall along the border with Mexico. He has drastically cut spending on border security as well. A Wall would cost the country billions.\nBut what would a wall cost? There are national parks, airports, a border fence and more! These are some of the proposed projects and national parks haven’t been touched, nor have the Great Smoky Mountains, Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Little Big Horn State, Everglades, Indian Lake, canals, lakes, freshwater springs and rivers.\nImagine, if we’re going to fix these failing and bankrupt Great Smoky Mountains! A 10-mile barrier with more land to protect, funding for water quality improvements and signage of good drivers to share, water, land and water use … we’re headed for a wall that we wouldn’t even like to see! Imagine this is what could cost our nation! Now how can we minimize the damage to our economy when every single person who crosses our border illegally owes us more than $9,000, and more than $1000?! That is a bill that would only benefit the very rich! What is wrong with these policies? These are not a demeaning message to someone that doesn’t want us to pay for his policies!\nIt’s now their job to replace him as president with John Kasich, and that could cost us up to $500 billion a year!\nTo keep things running smoothly, Trump and Kasich have had a major skirmish that brought them closer together as they represent Ohio. Kasich holds the seat of office on Ohio’s 4th Congressional District and Kasich represents Florida’s 2nd Congressional District.\nTrump has never really been a partisan in Ohio. He runs on the right, cares about working people, and enjoys winning so badly with the support of the many minorities, Native Americans, women, LGBTQ people, veterans, immigrants, immigrants to the U.S. from other countries, and people of color! He wears his heart on his sleeve and so has always been a winner.\nThe best thing he ever did was the tax cuts and make the American dream even easier to find. Donald Trump loved that. He is an unbelievably capable candidate to lead us down a path of economic growth and prosperity!\nMake no mistake, the damage has already been done to our national debt and our kids’ future will be devastating. The president is also the Democrat with the most popular celebrity in America – if all goes according to plan!\nThe lesson learned by Washington is this: Having a national consensus to prevent a crisis now could cause another crisis in the future. I love this country because it has a national consensus. But even if our country’s leadership demands a radical spending spree, I believe it is perfectly reasonable to ask the federal debt to be cut dramatically.\nAmericans are resilient and we need to be prepared for emergencies and other challenges. But it’s up to Congress to put out the fires and sit down and do what is right and what is necessary for us to function and protect our families and our communities.\nWe’re really tearing down our dreams for future generations that are Donald Trump.\nPlease follow CNN on Twitter and see CNN’s “There is no Trump!” video\n']"
860,SE Cupp: A third party could get us out of this mess,"['By Troy Smith, CNN\n(CNN) — A third party could do enough to protect you, but then it could prove toxic for you.\nThat’s why companies are banking on a new gig-by-gig approach to risk, a simplified jargonish place to work on a variety of fronts: the so-called G4S approach.\n“Beyond risk” consists of a three-year-long effort to identify the most appropriate risk-related behaviors to manage. In other words, G4S companies plan on getting your company out of these risk-gathering activities.\n“Instead of the single taggable tagline,” says Lance Baker, a researcher at Cornell University’s JPL (formerly Nanticoke Research Institute) and the director of G4S Research International. “Instead of getting a handle on what you’re willing to risk, the tagline is, ‘How can we prevent the environment from preventing climate change?’”\nG4S is part of 18 companies that will roll out a G4S service from May through July — and even more in the coming months.\nThe programs are designed to support companies that treat climate change as a simple luxury; a recognized disaster; and that people don’t need anymore.\nThe result is: better outcomes, fewer such experiences and less climate change-related problems, according to Baker.\nBut those are just some of the tasks that G4S experts are focusing on.\nBaker says one of the ways G4S helps companies push their boundaries is by giving G4S teams a way to trade over email privileges from the bulk of companies.\n“Organizations and employees have access to more appropriate email policies and controls,” he explains. “Competing email providers also allow organizations to specify which technologies the server enables them to use for email updates and policies.”\nCompanies can then assign those users multiple emails — such as appointments, donations, reviews and status updates — so there isn’t a standard hierarchy for lead, lead or lead management. That means managers can view whether to assign a lead solely for a call, not because it’s merely useful.\n“One or two senior managers on one team may have a team on that team,” Baker says. “This turns it into a successful business case for the entire team.”\nMcDonald’s, a restaurant chain that deploys the G4S software, says that contractors such as FedEx and UPS are more inclined to enter into monthly contracts than moving over to new servers.\nAnd FedEx — a key customer for G4S and its three partners — says it’s given more notice of its plans to shift back to a cloud-based environment. It promises speedier shipping times and a path to inventory replacements by analyzing emails.\n“With the data on our servers (as opposed to our centralized data centers), those same users can move to a cloud-based environment,” FedEx says.\n“I think the work is difficult to quantify,” says Dan Harrison, a senior vice president for business development at Fast Company in its annual “10 Companies Dominating the World.” “But it’s good news to realize you’re literally sitting at this crossroads with a very difficult action plan.”\nHe says companies have to plan around those words. That means, he says, selecting the right website, having automated resources on your website and otherwise managing emails using small Web-based machines.\n“You can work with the people you want in your organization, and then combine what you know to provide solutions to that,” says Harrison. “A lot of companies would love to have something like that. It is an absolute passion for the company, which is all about the experience.”\n']"
861,Confronting the cult of partisan media,"['Posted Wednesday, April 5, 2017 9:46 pm\nWhen I attend university in the American south, many of my peers continue to push for an end to the partisan media: the media the elite select and maintain. This, though, is especially true of all college and university professors. And the universities I attend have their own partisan institutions, which are as well.\nConsider the biggest universities in the nation: Notre Dame, Cornell, Rutgers, Columbia, Yale, Cal, South Florida, and Washington. College presidents are active in Congress, and former members of Congress and former members of Congress are engaging with Fox News, ABC News, CNN, MSNBC, CBS News, Fox Business, CNN and other news outlets. I have been invited to attend broadcast dinners hosted by these networks, events I have yet to attend.\nI never met college presidents. When I did, however, I was introduced to media chief Bob Woodward who asked me why there was so much coverage on campus and radio. He then asked me to write a thesis on the shift in media coverage from its former, and admirable, authorial character.\nThere was a huge surge in independent online reporting in the \'80s, and I thought that was positive news. However, the media coverage have increased, as was the magnitude of the increase in partisan outlets: CBS a daily met several times, Fox News Sunday and CNN tied for second, and is more than twice the size of the pro-reform HuffPo\nOver the last several years, my generation has become completely separate from the political left. Neither PBS nor CNN exist. Neither Fox News nor CNN have time to interact with students or students at Cornell. It has been strange. Journalism, perhaps, isn\'t the center of the new politics -- its center is college.\nEverything I do at Cornell compares to my predecessors. More importantly, it compares not only to my predecessors, but to my parents\' generation. My parents graduated from college in 1964. But my parents\' generation are now gone.\nThe media strategy by these institutions that is succeeding right now, how they adapt to the changing media landscape, and how they respond to it, reveals a very disturbing truth.\nOne of the most misleading aspects of college journalism is that they are aloof in fact -- they don\'t try to be conservative, they don\'t respond to criticism, they feel they cannot control their audience.\nWhen students ask what degree they received, they are often assuming that they were doing a thing right. When students ask what college classes they attended -- not simply what colleges they attended -- they are often relying on the words of the individual on the college website.\nThese kinds of deceptive tactics continue to exist. For example, some media outlets have reported that the Colorado Springs college had admitted as many as six dishonest students to a school, sometimes double or triple the number of students admitted as told.\nTime after time, colleges have encouraged students to find the truth. The national debate on college admissions has continued apace, after news outlets have focused exclusively on the selective admissions process.\nAt the University of Michigan, there was an overnight student suspension after a freshman student exposed he had a ""too-boyish-looking"" obsession with the BDSM movement. The university had a headmaster then.\nThen there was the Amherst College of Art and Design, where administrators fired the dean of students after a sophomore student was accused of taking part in an art contest in the jewelry department. That same group of students remain enrolled at Amherst, yet again, because of (the host\'s) partisan coverage.\nThe underlying truth is that these universities are not doing anything right. This is less about education, more about media manipulation.\nThis is particularly true of colleges who are dominant in their own universities. These schools have been associated with prominent networks like MSNBC, ABC News, Fox News, CNN, NPR, Time and NPR, not to mention the academic reputation of those networks and professors (many of whom were unionized at their colleges).\nPart of the problem has to do with the role that professors play in society. Under President Donald Trump, colleges have been criticized as caring — much too caring — about taxpayer dollars. Republicans, after all, have done a fantastic job at reducing class sizes in recent years.\nThey have been very active in increasing the amount of money that the government spends on universities. Also, they are expanding their budgets year after year in ways that favor student neediest students.\nThere is a lot to learn about these universities. But those who engage in both their politics and the factual analyses that aim to advance their interests will have a very difficult time hearing from them.\n']"
862,26 voices on why the free press matters,"['By Charles M. Smith\nSenior White House correspondent, CNN\nWe’re nowhere near full support for the democratic reform narrative in the United States. We have a population under 40, where as the CEO of the Small Business Administration, Jessica Mendoza was in charge of getting grants to many businesses.\nOur government was introduced to the media by Congress, which stripped two major media voices of their power. Yours, the late editorial page editor turned columnist, John King. Rulings from the editorial board weren’t distributed to members of Congress. And there were no hearings.\nThat made us all mistrust government. After all, these were people we needed more than an inkling we could be informed by old news clips or scientific data.\nDo you really think we are paying attention to the truth? We must.\nWe see in the paydays of our Facebook friends what we can buy and how we can find out about it. And we buy things by filing them to the press. And sometimes by friends. And sometimes by lovers of the free press.\nThink about it. As King observed in his vivid lucid writings of the challenges of standing up for liberty, he no longer felt let down, and he admitted publicly that he was a “man of honesty.”\nToday, if we blame the media for the Trump administration’s dismal economic success, it is largely inaccurate. We are still in the dark about the failure of the administration. And we’re left with the images that we wanted to portray to make people forget our voices have been silent for so long. And that seems to be the underlying theme for this political discourse.\nFor the last two decades, freedom of the press has been a campaign issue in our country, and we’ve been working together for years to put it out to pasture. There is talk about replacing the Federal Communications Commission with a smaller one, and it’s fair to suggest that this could happen in a Democrat-controlled Senate. Or one with no big White House.\nBut perhaps most troubling is the rhetoric we have heard. I’ll set the record straight: The current administration’s obsession with free speech isn’t just about the collection of evidence that proves Republican policies didn’t work—it’s also about taking the fight to lower our voices.\nEven when we have an elected leader who has her heart set on the presidency, we don’t have the political will, or the legal capacity, to wield that power. A powerful executive insists that we stop pursuing laws that harm jobs. Even the incoming administration has a tradition of bending to President Trump’s will, most recently when the president-elect nominated Timothy O’Brien, then the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to chair the agency for public safety.\nWe need leaders who are interested in civil discourse, who want to share the common ground rather than engage in global warfare. Those among us who are on the center of the conversation will have the chance to exercise those civic values. Those of us in opposition of the president-elect will have the chance to use that perspective in the fight to promote Trump and his agenda. That’s why freedom of the press makes our democracy great.\n']"

Like Twitter!\nYes, Twitter, it's the social network where many people will comment on news, suggest new products and often about politics themselves.\nBut it's also like Facebook, where people will merely digest the news and post video reviews for each other.\nBut Twitter is where The Washington Post takes its own political satire seriously as it competes with Google's Daily Beast and Time to attract readers.\nEverything has always been and will always be different from the rest of us.\nI've spent the last year wondering if Twitter is up to the challenge of taking on our once-rock-solid, inaccessible legacy.\nTwitter announced that it was holding a contest that kicked off Tuesday. What it saw was a way to incentivize contributions and increase the amount that people can donate.\nThe company then announced that it would award $10,000 worth of prizes to people who tweet, share, blog or comment about what they saw or heard. Those two were top entries.\nTo answer that question:\nThose who click on a link to the contest's winner will be rewarded with a brand new Twitter handle: Sheryl Sandberg's Twitter Handle, the @SylSandberg.\nA $5,000 reward will be given in a lifetime. You can still enter.\nCounting the winners is limited to people who can tweet their responses on Monday.\nIf you didn't already have your @SylSandberg handle, don't panic. This is the second year in a row that the group won a contest with the hashtag #CleanAnalysis.\nBy the way, Twitter announced that it will be returning to its roots of #ThinkNow for more information.\nAnd just in case you're wondering what Twitter did to spark the study of reproductive rights, you just read that Sarah Palin's kids were involved in it. The trouble is, they're never actually citizens and aren't even eligible to vote. That means that birth control isn't that easy to access.\nBut you still have a lot of possibilities.\nWhile you may agree that voting is a pain, how do you imagine changing our culture through the use of social media?\nResearchers at the UCLA Shute Institute said their research on the creation of a government website suggested a way to improve the lives of Americans whose social and political movements had made it difficult for them to obtain birth control.\nIt's just a start, though.\nHere are a few ways social media can make us more connected.\nIn a statement, CEO Jack Dorsey said:\nToday, we celebrate 40 years of leading men who changed the way we do business, innovate and connect. We see the power of big ideas to impact society through active involvement and video campaigns. Think Now, at 60 million unique users per day, celebrates of some of those 30 years of badass female leaders.\nThat was a pretty massive undertaking.\nBut I'm on to something.\nDo we really need any more women in government? Well, quite possibly. But I don't think Republicans are going to get paid if they want to. And I hope no one gets pooh-poohed at home when they pick up their phones and watch people in prison complain about not having access to contraceptives.\nI hope no one is asked about it. I hope we make it possible for women to voice their concerns —whether they get it from friends or corporate or individual or political leaders — directly.\nBut I'm afraid, they're scared to do so.\n""]"

The human personage that is made in these exact places is just the symbol for perfect characters that exist, simply uncorks, and invites us to create them.\nAnd that's what we do. Without dreaming of all the illusions or blurred reality, we would miss the glaring truth: perfect characters exist. When you see these, you understand the beautiful, hardworking souls that they are. If you just see the quiet, rustic simplicity in the sheepish way – or worse, the simple uplifting, ochre life of those down to earth, young, juicy rhinos and grizzled bears – it's a sign of sure things.\nWe post the world as beautiful, as progressive, as crisp as roses. We post the powerful grey clouds. Even then, we might be giddy that some of this is real, and on the bottom of the mountain we're flying.\nThe beauty of the world is written on the inside of our heads, on the dirt of the earth, on that wall that the giant horses sit in, on the yoga mats, on the hills of autumn. We are seeing mountains as imperfect shapes, though often rather fluffy and natural.\nI wrote the letter before we knew the world that existed. It's the most magical and startling thing we've ever seen. It's the most beautiful and magical thing we have ever experienced.\nIt took months of translation, carefully dictating to the codt of human nature. I wrote my letter by phone to (note: only) executive editor of Detroit, the unknown. I didn't always like the phone, never liked the hard news, and never like all that jazz. I wrote the letter three days after the first of my family's trees exploded. I wrote it on the day of their birthday. I wrote it on the day the first men got up.\nI gave myself a holiday too, because life, my heart and my soul, are always me.\nI wrote it to celebrate beauty in the world. It was art. It was poetry.

865,Why the black press is more relevant than ever,"['“The FBI and Congress should be laughing.”\nThat’s the refrain from U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) at a news conference where he sought to correct his oft-maligned report about the FBI’s 2014 raid on Planned Parenthood.\nThe incident prompted Trump to dismiss Nunes altogether, for reasons ranging from opportunism to a revealing defect. He suggested the probe was going, yes, tough enough for his investigation of the FBI.\nHis next tweet referring to any probe with “strong subject matter” is a reminder of his insatiable zeal for the political right.\nNunes’s findings of an ongoing investigation into leaks to journalists has stoked a national debate over the legitimacy of congressional investigations.\nThe fast-growing, heated press has been a vital, if temporarily embattled, conduit for many investigations over the past two decades.\nIt serves as a critical thumb in a headlong rush by the Trump administration to end the partisan gridlock at the federal and state levels.\nBut to those who favor the status quo, Nunes’s personal attacks are just a trip down memory lane. He has focused on the FBI’s investigation into possible links between Trump campaign aides and Russians during the 2016 election, and blamed Republicans for their failure to investigate possible collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Moscow.\nNone of this involved collusion and didn’t happen, of course. The story died along the campaign trail.\nDemocrats were prepared for it, but they didn’t know how to react. That job should never have been left to a partisan outlet, particularly one that so frequently supports the GOP.\nNunes thinks the FBI acted illegally and somehow lied to Congress, and he has issues with the lawmakers trying to flip over the issue.\nWhen asked about the reports of an FBI agent planting two leaks at the Arizona State Department of Public Safety (PSA), he accused them of being “deliberately a political attack in the spirit of the Committee on Investigating Hillary Clinton’s Email Scandal.”\n“I’m not getting involved in it,” Nunes said, adding, “It has nothing to do with me or our investigations.”\nNunes would be successful.\nBut even if the FBI mishandled the story, it’s unlikely they’ll provide proof that the agency has in fact done anything wrong, like of the manner in which it found out about the leak of memos issued by Tom Bossert, the former head of the FBI’s Los Angeles division.\n“We have more information than information we could have been given,” Nunes said.\nThe questions are the consequence of what happened during that embarrassing confrontation in the House in December. Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) has tried to put on the record why Trump made that decision, and he has two eyes waiting for the conclusions.\nBut the Congressional Ethics Committee is willing to add to the furor. The panel’s advisory panel on congressional ethics will investigate the FBI’s Internal Revenue Service (IRS) leaks to the media, and whether any such emails are relevant to the 2018 congressional elections.\nInvestigators already are gearing up for the outcome of the probe, as they are in California.\nPresident Trump has made it clear he is fed up of Nunes and his findings, and the constant chatter about the “Russian witch hunt” has bolstered Democrats’ desire to hold the probe on the account of “top political staffers.”\nBut Nunes may be right to do so. Trump’s former legal adviser, Michael Cohen, was indicted on a criminal conspiracy charge in December. Trump could face some complicated charges if he responds to the entire investigation without self-serving complaints by Republicans and special counsel Robert Mueller.\nNunes’s goal is clear: Americans should be laughing at all sorts of conduct while a scandal engulfs them in a partisan realm.\n']"
866,Branding news outlets as foreign agents won't make them any more transparent,"[""Any foreign journalist who scoops a story that gives them a severe audience on social media or sports will soon face a double-whammy.\nThe Washington Post's reporters, Cameron Bailey and Ezra Klein, expose some foreign agents as struggling to navigate media policy over a reported breakup with their longtime partner. Their stories that trace many of these non-western stories back to Washington, represented at least part of their journalistic modus operandi. A focus on domestic communications — there's a broad spectrum of the global press in both the Beltway and in the workplace — makes them as infrequently relevant to journalists as their journalists.\nBut it's not just domestic access that's undermined. The coverage of Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 election, and U.S. obstruction of the Russia investigation, has given foreign journalists greater access to Fox News and MSNBC. That's why it's imperative we in Washington and elsewhere start working in a new, more transparent way — to defend American journalists against foreign agents or foreign meddling. It's not too late.\nThe stakes are higher today, and the news media in the United States must use their power to define the boundaries and the frontiers of a global industry that is already vibrant.\n""]"
867,Student journalists deserve a free press too,"['By Andrew Hill\nMy friend and colleague, Mary Atkin, just graduated from a female journalism degree in 2012, and this year she and a small group of students from the University of Pittsburgh published two books about journalism — one about the 2001 anthrax sting in Washington and the other about the concept of free speech.\nMy colleague, Nick Alden, is one of us, but mostly we’re students and students of other institutions. We were interested to see what the writers from both platforms thought about free speech, and largely what they thought about it.\nI gave this title to a great book (Entitled Free Speech for Journalists by Mary Atkin, in reference to the Nature Line column about \'spreadability and the evolution of consent\' in politics). He wrote about how the “contentistic” movement, he said, “for many of us has become little more than a yawning yawn” and to what extent do we think and speak as we believe?\nMary Atkin and her colleagues—Mary Langford, Kevin Drew, and Jesse Mathews—found the kind of diverse perspective we need as journalists. As one of our esteemed contributors, I agreed with her. When I showed her a journalist posing a thorny question, she used a pen to elaborate in detail.\nSo why did she put out this book? Why did we think that brave young journalists should be respected in their area of expertise? Mary Atkin said that free speech has always been important, but journalists should have the freedom to express themselves equally. Atkin told me that “it would not matter whether [the journalists] said what they said, or if they said what they thought, whether they stood by what they said.”\nIn my mind, free speech was not just just the form of written criticism, or as a tool that publishers would employ to dress up their books to give them brand recognition, but also those books for the success of the other professions. For example, writers who wrote for various TV shows gave unexpected and unexpected success by announcing that their subjects were writers. Women writers encouraged us to think outside the box in popular culture, and writers who had an opinion that could be misinterpreted by anyone. Even if we’re in college, we’re free to express ourselves outside of our free time.\nJournalists from various networks and/or media organizations must take the same risk to argue against free speech at all. For them, the vast majority of time spent covering the earth can give us skills and voice that cover a variety of subject areas, which allows them to show us what they mean when talking about what we do. And speaking to a journalist does not necessarily mean asking you to practice your spoken word. Journalists like Mary Atkin, who speaks directly and comprehensively, can even offer words of support and encouragement, for example, to writers who want to connect, even support, people not to be influenced by a message.\nJournalists sometimes have to show us what’s really important to them and how important it is to them, but that’s how the small group of them came up with the idea for ""Free Speech for Journalists."" I’ll tell you why: because, as we all know, we are precious hanmen.\nI am so proud of this idea. It’s so important to us that we must treat each other with respect and respect without it interfering with our freedom to assert ourselves. Thank you, Mary Atkin, for upping your homework.\n']"
868,Media martyrs: Among those who died while working as journalists in the past 15 years,"['Posted Tuesday, April 5, 2019 11:00 am\nOne year into holding leadership positions in the government broadcasting industry, the path to independence has been very rough. When President Trump announced in the spring of 2017 that he was creating a special commission to study the scope of the national broadcasting industry, it was ostensibly to prioritize new industry measures like better use of and investment in broadcasting. But one year later, this new group of bipartisan industry leaders seem to have stumbled, and, as of last week, may not even be emerging.\nMany of these well-connected corporate moguls have been conducting interviews among their peers and their organizations in the past two years, attracting welcome attention for their collaborative approaches, free-wheeling investigations, and their outspokenness in making the case for both the importance of local media and the limitations of federal law.\nAccording to the Financial Times, Vice President Mike Pence worked with the former Prince Charlie speechwriter in 1995, and in 1997 he persuaded members of Congress to act on economic aid for Syrian refugees. (Three of them sought the same punishment from Congress.) During the 2000 campaign, Vice President Joe Biden also held discussions with the party and the White House on the issue, and in 2007 Biden threatened to boycott the GOP Party convention if the system’s elected officials failed to support the convention resolution condemning the Islamic State.\n“They’re no longer dominant groups in the party anymore — they’re already gone,” says David Jernigan, a U.S. professor and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. There has been a rapid consolidation of the powerful within this new breed of media leaders.\n“A number of important congressional Republicans and senators, and not a few powerful voices, are becoming increasingly vocal in supporting the separation of powers,” Jernigan says. “It’s a fairly dramatic shift. This separation of powers is one of the major contributors to large-scale illegal immigration.”\nMuch of the recent upheaval over a proposal to restrict immigration comes from discussion of the specific barriers this effort would seek to relieve, such as the restrictions on the civil immigration system, for the recruitment of candidates for U.S. Special Forces. But the idea is catching on. And it’s being embraced by Congress, some of which already has laws in place, such as those concerning outreach to the elderly and infirm.\nIt’s almost certainly not the single single biggest issue the Republicans and their new majority have debated, though the four Senate senators behind the so-called immigration bill have promised — with the hope of being able to iron out major parts — that the divisions within their party will be addressed as soon as possible. “I think they’re willing to get together,” says Jernigan. “There seems to be a willingness on both sides.”\nMeanwhile, those efforts are small potatoes compared to what has been happening throughout the North American broadcast business at a federal level. Comcast Corp., the parent company of CNN, with its sale of Charter Communications to CNN earlier this year, showed that, even if it falls short of breaking even, it has still managed to turn a profit. Turner Broadcasting Group, Inc., a division of Time Warner, reported a 19.4% increase in earnings for its second quarter. The median price paid for cable television in the US is $18.78 per month.\nAll that’s left of that business, however, is to look for ways to be the most competitive in the industry. “First and foremost, competition is great” says Jan Lande, president of the nation’s largest and most respected multicultural and multicultural group called Media First. “New technologies, in terms of content development, impact access to new audiences, and also new production platforms, will do more to improve access to and guide video news in African-American communities.”\nThis year, companies including Yahoo, Facebook, and Netflix have discussed potentially harvesting the popularity of streaming as news in the Philippines, creating even more interesting ways to reach poor people in the first place, as the ratings of the Netflix drama, “House of Cards,” shows. The prospects, however, are decidedly bleak.\n']"
869,Why press freedom is your freedom,"['Saudi Arabia is one of the world’s most repressive regimes and according to CNN is a total tyrannical regime. CNN Arabia seems to produce the perfect case for a New Era.\nSeveral news outlets have a record of using violent language to condemn Saudi Arabia. But why did King Abdullah, the supreme head of the Islamic State (ISIS), bravely use violence against religious minorities or journalists to deal with vicious protests? Is it a matter of prestige or prestige?\nLike all propaganda outlets, CNN does not treat its report as the state’s home page. The government was not given the opportunity to hide from the news, nor was its distorting or controlling coverage just simply evident. To get around the law, CNN utilizes the “safe space” CNN is developing over in Saudi Arabia—a ""one stop shop"" for the coverage of events around the world, and a convenient place for anyone with a digital presence.\nAs you can see from the chart above, even when reporters weren’t using live footage, CNN has often dealt with sporadic, far from violent protests in the West. That’s because press freedom is an internationalist non-state means of promoting information. CNN has done a U.S. plus handful of investigative journalism and has allowed foreign reporters working out of Riyadh to work on cover stories reporting on any violation of international law.\nIf you look closely at the Times of London and other newspapers from which we are embedded, they have been deeply critical of the Saudi rulers for many months. And just recently, they demanded that the Saudi government remove us from certain sections of its weekly newspaper.\nCNN’s reporting on these big-city protests can seem so mainstream, but the demand for our exit seems like a statement to anyone looking into U.S. national security.\nTo turn against the Communist East Asian regimes in that region, you could turn the American media against dictators in your own country. This was one plan—which was based on my argument that democracy has been trapped in ever-so-slightly “wrong” countries, where there is no one, and no one is held accountable. Democracy has helped create the Black Death and other unrestpots that we’ve been held responsible for all through the decades.\nAnd while every American understands that democracy has been trapped in ever-so-slightly “wrong” countries, if we allow conflict and repression to destroy an institution like a democracy, we are bound to do whatever it takes to keep it safe. There is no “democracy” to criticize.\nThat is why CNN has built a government by consent of the American people. As we learn, they do not make their own decisions. As their platform highlights the really notable newsstand, CNN has controlled their own newsroom for years, and access is rare for the publication.\nSo why do we expect outrage? The U.S. government has found all sorts of unacceptable errors or outright violations of human rights. It has undermined the various institutions that make those institutions work. That is why there is such a vibrant role for BBC journalists that employ freelance Iraqis, and even better, BBC reporters in Saudi Arabia.\nIt’s clear that CNN’s cover story on Saudi Arabia is largely engineered by Saudi Arabia’s media. There is no identifiable “democracy” in the headline, yet there is an almost prima facie consensus among the mainstream media and in Saudi society that any misadventure that occurs there is being completely committed by the Saudi government.\nIn many ways CNN is playing a major role as a propaganda arm for the Saudi regime. Alongside any failure to sufficiently defend fundamental human rights in Saudi Arabia, CNN journalists love a mission and are willing to pursue the underdog. That may not be an easy agenda to execute, but it is the best the media ever has to do to endure. It’s human nature.\nCNN itself is suffering from the malady. People love beating up their sons and daughters. The same-sex marriage amendment passed in California is easily revisited and is barely touched by conservative progressives who insist it is a threat to society, and one used to serve their own agendas. For CNN, it is down to another corporation to see what their American public palates are getting ready to watch.\nIt appears as if the Saudi government is simply not going to recognize or permit independent reporting about the Saudi regime to survive. But CNN is just one step away from giving American readers a New Era.\n']"

""I love what I do. I love our kids, though, and we make sure their day passes without me having any care.""\nOlson is a father of two and a grandfather.

871,The Trump administration is hiding something,"['What\'s a simple thing to hide?\nWhat\'s a cyber calamity when numerous other monsters, some of them remotely under attack, are said to be holding one another\'s humanity hostage?\nFor officials focused on preventing or mitigating a cyber attack, revelations about data breaches in key sectors could have dire consequences. Rather than taking on the difficult task of communicating with such threats, they\'re likely to instead be taking on the name-calling and catch-the-guy talk.\n""Take the IRS"" is a misnomer.\nThe IRS is the target of the most sophisticated cyber threats in history, according to The New York Times, which notes that the Department of Homeland Security officials routinely use ""50 or 100"" cryptic words to describe specific targets, and who can blame them?\n""The first one to be cataloged,"" said Kelley Hobbs, a senior policy analyst with the Violence Policy Center. The other, Ben Hester, a policy director with Emory University, said the maximum threat radius for terrorists would be 6,000 meters, ""with a hover gun to kill a person.""\nDeliberations that will likely be triggered by a data breach, and evidence-gathering trips to news sites like the New York Times, ABC News and The Guardian, reportedly could begin next week in the course of a Guardian investigation.\nOn Tuesday, from there, ""unnamed homeland security officials, including DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and senior security adviser Lisa Monaco, were forced to hint at vulnerabilities in the Department of Homeland Security computer network that could allow hackers to reach into consumers\' personal data and redirect data stored online onto them.\n""Some of them apparently felt that the effort was infeasible,"" Hester said. ""Ultimately, everyone agreed on one thing.""\nHester and Hobbs declined to disclose their personal names.\n""We don\'t think we should be helping harm [one another], but we shouldn\'t have to stay quiet because it\'s a one-shot deal,"" Hobbs said.\nAttorneys for New York Mayor Bill de Blasio offered to build a firewall over the city\'s internet network, said Heather Thompson, a social security attorney.\nHowever, when asked whether this unusual arrangement could impact NYPD investigators looking into “the behavior of a few agencies” on the Net, Hobbs said, ""I don\'t know what you\'re talking about.""\nChris Capress, a lawyer with Rafferty Davis, a firm that specializes in cyber-privacy law, said, ""It\'s unfortunate that this so-called bad actors may feel comfortable hiding behind the radar by going public. That\'s not the law.""\nOftentimes, he said, ""we don\'t know until someone publishes and it makes it easy for them to slip in"" as time and manpower grows to target such accounts.\n""The potential is that if the person in question is a witness of a terrorist attack, we may have to withhold their investigation,"" Capress said.\nHester suggested that some of the data breaches may come from ""a hacking campaign.""\nAccording to the Times, the government\'s reaction to “an unusually violent cyber activity” near the end of 2016 was to opt out of its annual National Information Assurance Agency survey. The survey asked all agencies to do a year\'s worth of things, such as sample surveys to see if they could provide more insight into the attribution of the cyberattacks, and which systems were compromised.\nThis decision had numerous unintended consequences.\nFirst, cyberattacks may have caused personal data to be mishandled, possibly revealing intelligence of known attacks, according to the Times. More dangerously, the Times reported, ""It could mean an attack against the administration\'s spy agency, or on Internet providers, which could be dealing with even more attacks on intelligence agencies.""\nThe result could also be embarrassment for an office of the powerful, which already has been worried about its own cyberattack capabilities and struggled to keep its employees ""local.""\n""We just want to stay safe, right? All of these things are really going to happen to us, to our intelligence organizations,"" Hobbs said.\n""At this point, everything we do and how we communicate with people ... I don\'t think it will be there until we have to hang the head out of a pretty big bucket,"" Capress said.\n']"
872,What this will cost Mitch McConnell,"['Speaker of the House Michael Mitchum, who spoke at Tuesday’s Joint Session of Congress, said he is not running for president; he just loves it here on television. While many Republicans are unlikely to stick around the country to vote against President Trump, their fate is yours.\nMitchum was a rival for the Republican presidential nomination; which he failed to win. But as he was campaigning against Donald Trump and his conservative agenda for Congress, he showed the same passion he exhibited in office that helped him be elected to the Senate.\nDespite his tepid support among voters, Mitchum seized upon his strong support for immigration reform to win the Republican nomination, even launching a failed bid for Senate president on the strength of religious liberty.\nHe has already voted against immigration reform three times (see “Turning to religion to advance immigration reform”). In 2017, he voted for the DACA program; in 2014, he opposed it as it wasn’t in his lifetime; and in 2012, he voted against the DREAM Act; in 2013, he voted for a resolution asking Congress not to fund the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program; and in 2015, he backed a Republican proposal that would have begun the process of comprehensive immigration reform.\nA fine line for Mitchum: Does the anti-immigration rhetoric on the left obstruct the strength of his campaign? Or does it create an unsafe setting for Trump and his agenda?\nWhat happened at Tuesday’s Joint Session on Republican involvement in Congress is a precursor to what comes next. With Nancy Pelosi at the helm, the new majority Democratic majority has three choices – either surrender leadership and renounce the GOP amnesty plan, or capitulate to a so-called alternative, complete repeal of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.\nIf only Mitchum’s and Pelosi’s approach to immigration reform – explicitly accepted by the majority of conservatives – resulted in a vote to approve Trump’s president’s immigration proposal.\nIf only he would’ve stepped aside this time.\nWhile Mitchum shouldn’t play hide-and-seek with Trump and his “establishment,” he’s treading on the line to try to embrace the would-be president’s economic populist message.\nThe nominee to be Mitchum’s White House campaign manager would add significantly to the swamp within the GOP party. If Trump carried in November, Mitchum would then be a thorn in Mitchum’s side, accusing the GOP establishment of being slow to recognize the president’s commitment to fiscal responsibility.\nIf that behavior continues, there are sharp polls showing Trump’s approval rating between 40% and 63%. Mitchum would put together a powerfully positive impression of the Republican Party.\n']"

874,House Democrats can't miss this valuable opportunity,"['WASHINGTON – After touring the federal government, the President appeared at events and watched presentations. The President and Congress must do more than cheer and waffle.\nThe next time you watch news reporting on politics in the congressional environment, remember these facts:\nRepublicans are filibustering legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\nEvery House Republican voted for this money.\n“The American people will not stop the Democrats from repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act,” House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters Monday morning in his daily agenda in the Senate.\n“If the American people want to know about it, they will do that themselves. We will not give up. We will be relentless,” Ryan said.\nDemocrats are in a hole and have no way of surviving. If they can pull together and break all the obstructions, Republicans won’t have to stop them.\nNow is the time to get active.\nA bipartisan group of House Democrats has released a strategy to reach their targets, the first of which – and the most important one – must be the repeal bill. House leaders insist they’re “committed to trying this bill” and require legislation within the framework of a working plan by the end of June.\nThey can make up for it by promising not to delay the defunding of vital parts of the Affordable Care Act. They believe they have the votes and will work with Republicans in both chambers to pass the legislation soon.\nIt is crucial that Republican leaders -- and like-minded Republicans -- pull off this historic “no” vote, even if some in the media and other pro-life advocacy groups oppose it. This will hand House Republicans even more leverage over GOP opponents, just as it has since Obama’s last reelection campaign.\nStep up the pressure on Republicans, and put forth a clear pathway to repeal the Affordable Care Act and clean up the tax code. If Republicans can pull off that process within the framework of a working plan, Democratic leaders would have no reason to hide under the cover of darkness for what may be months.\nIn the meantime, Democrats must make their own strong plan – and actually set themselves up for success. There’s a $2 trillion federal deficit in American federal coffers today. Congress must control it to retire some of the liabilities.\nIn no doubt, those estimates need to be revised to make sense and explain the how many people it will eliminate.\nMeanwhile, Republicans have already indicated they want to increase Social Security benefits for the elderly by a fifth – somewhere between 30% and 60%.\nThey don’t want to eliminate Medicare, don’t want to abolish Social Security and do not want to stop Medicare.\nBut seriously consider Democratic pledges of spending cuts. Putting further burden on Social Security recipients and providing voucher-like payments for college graduates would get Republicans beyond hardball tactics.\nIf Democrats can close any funding gap, assuming Republicans don’t tack on the repeal bill to pass at the end of June, it would help solve the federal budget crisis that has already proved extremely unpopular.\n']"
875,Trump's 'I want nothing' defense doesn't hold water,"[""Nancy Pelosi sniped that Trump isn't actually “standing on the shoulders of people who want nothing” while defending his idea of of offering a voluntary suspension to people protesting against what he sees as unfair, racist deals being tossed around by the federal government.\nShe basically used the analogy of her age as just two years ago, noting that it wasn’t that long ago that the president fired Robert Mueller, who was investigating collusion between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia, for a fake news story that had stoked a Russian election scandal, some even saying that Trump made peace with Bill Ayers (Stephen Colbert described him, and Bannon allude to him, as a “born boy”), she said.\nAt this point, all would make sense, she said, except that any sort of agreement would come with a mutual fear, a vindictive retaliation of coming on top of anger so long as “fairness” gets a greater “equity”.\nThe notion of breaking from your pledge to cut spending is not particularly a winning one. Some of our highest levels of government accept only one set of cuts while endless battles with other government agencies, legislative and executive, can eat our brains for months. Your default position is to give in to those who truly want nothing.\nAlthough Speaker Nancy Pelosi today listed the five demands of resistance to Trump: first, for the president to negotiate with Congress, second, to implement the Health and Human Services Act (which limits future expansion of health insurance to people with preexisting conditions), third, for the replacement of the education and defense budgets by Democratic budgeting and certification, the national debt to be brought down to $50 trillion by 2033 (which is clearly part of the $20 trillion crisis that remains), we can only exercise this “feeling” as a party.\nWhat Congress could have done was to drop the Kaepernick issue and find common ground with the NFL players on the subject — rather than continuing to protect people who are on the wrong side of the Constitution, who would think that a civil right is not a fair fighting ground to allow. After all, if you can’t get agreement with the other side, you have nothing to lose — and shame on anyone they might jeopardize by not pursuing a fight.\nWhen Trump tried to have the Justice Department prosecute the likes of Wolff without first getting an indictment, he actually got a guilty plea and was acquitted. Perhaps his head was spinning at the same time: we all hate him (or are content with his voting record.) Unfortunately, it was this excuse that Obama officials, put up through impeachment, caved in to.\nIf Trump would sit back and let veterans avoid violence, fear and division, we could go about dealing with a rise in unemployment rates, now having more college graduates than citizens; more immigrant children being sent to the United States today than fathers. Better to hear all of this from our President.\n""]"
876,Democrats' only choice is to impeach Trump,"['1 of 2 2 of 2\nBy Rachel Abramson, CNN\nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- On Wednesday, the Congressional Oversight Panel and the nation\'s top political strategist delivered their vote on constitutional amendments to allow Congress to impeach President Donald Trump.\n""The Constitution, the House, and the Senate should protect American democracy from becoming an unholy collection of evil people who stir up patriotic passion,"" the panel\'s chairman and ranking member, Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, said in a statement.\nCiting a ""radical fundamentalism that has dramatically transformed our political establishment,"" he added, ""this amendment would enshrine Senate control over the president\'s power to fire law enforcement, make attorney general appointments, remove political appointees from his Cabinet and change campaign finance laws to favor corporate donors rather than Americans.""\nSome Democrats have lashed out at the commission for voting to remove Trump from office while Vice President Mike Pence and others got extensions for the debate.\n""Today is an unprecedented day in which our political leaders are using national power in a way that fundamentally corrupts the American people,"" said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, the panel\'s chairman.\nAt this point, it\'s unclear how the panel will vote on the amendment, and who will decide. But the panel and most other political and legal experts, including campaign finance experts, say that it represents a ""strike"" on the ""risk-reward"" of being taken out of the president\'s hands and without a parallel attempt to move it to the floor.\nRep. John Lewis of Georgia, who is black, called it a blow to racial justice and constitutional interpretation that ""we\'ve no longer had a president who can say that the Constitution is a joke.""\nThe panel recommends that Trump\'s removal be part of a fourth-term. That would mean Trump would retain his office until 2024, a year later than the current president and Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton.\nIt\'s unclear how Republican Attorney General Jeff Sessions, currently the most senior legal official in the Trump administration, would be involved. The panel is considering whether it would approve his request to continue his legal service pending his review of the commission\'s findings.\nDuring the hearing, multiple Republican members of the panel cried foul over the commission\'s decision, including Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, a member of the ""No on 4"" leadership team.\n""Maybe the self-righteous national order of our day, which is \'vote \'em up or \'vote \'em down,\' is coming to an end,"" said Cummings.\nIn addition to causing a split among the panel\'s members, the protests at two White House events on Wednesday made it clear that there would be no room for broad discussion.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., joined Trump for one of the first White House events of the day, where Trump called on the commission to ""let the criminal justice system go away.""\nIt\'s unclear what went into the concerns held on Wednesday.\nIn reality, they were the only way for the majority of the panel to keep hearing President Trump\'s views on immigration, taxes, jobs and economic initiatives.\nThe panel members were sympathetic to each side on a number of issues, but said their main request was to keep them waiting until they were resolved on the measure to vote on it, so that they could ""gather together and say, \'Wow, here we go. What do we do?\'""\n']"
877,Rescue Kavanaugh? Trump's ridiculous idea,"[""Your absurd claim that Kavanaugh never did or has ever tried to abuse women would sound bizarre if you had the chance to read that summary in your email or newspaper. But I have one:\nAdam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, recently recalled that a “source” who briefed him on Trump's eligibility said he’d met with former Trump White House lawyer Michael Cohen at the White House. In addition, Schiff said, he’d also read a White House official who testified that Trump “never used any kind of violence or recklessness to suggest we were in trouble.” “Our briefing by Cohen is unprecedented, if not unprecedented in terms of domestic political speech and communication,” Schiff said. “To a lot of people — even to Trump himself — it was a textbook violation of confidentiality.”\nIt turns out the stories were true, as my colleague Daniel Petrocelli points out — some researchers believe that Cohen may have exposed Trump’s pre-trial bar without any evidence, despite Cohen saying that he didn’t even know about it.\nStill, the anonymous CIA source was better than Schiff, and that should give you reason to believe that Trump is not prone to deceit. President Obama said that he couldn’t yet tell what Lewinsky might have told him in the coming months, because it was “so controversial” to first give me a review of Trump’s claim. As Paul Kessler points out, Trump “kept on the defensive,” but his claims of violating a president’s constitutional right to the presumption of innocence have reverberated throughout history and will never be completely discredited.\nThat being said, we have another former colleague who reminded me of a line we all saw before the election. Trump wrote up in order to paint himself as disloyal to Ted Cruz because he had been in the Senate (so you can guess what the actual claim is), but that allegation obviously would not have been a bad thing to write if she’d publicly convinced him:\nAgain, the question would need to be decided in context, and from the American people. Would she have resigned or resigned straight from the Senate that day? Did she really have a total written response? Our country voted for Ted Cruz, and the answer is yes, she was popular and talented and wrote a report on Hillary Clinton, and the answer is no.\nThis proves that the president is not a proud male narcissist who likely loves urbane women. More proof: Yet another piece in a cocktail party the one I took at the Ford Center held last Tuesday was an invitation to an exclusive dinner, where not only did Trump’s accusers attend, but a couple dozen others paid $5000 each. There were phones coming out, and there was beer and sandwiches. Very impressive.\nIt’s sad that the president’s behavior has gotten such a go-with-it-the-after-party vibe, but this year is only the third time in modern American history that a president has engaged in such a joke-by-the-night act.\nYes, a guy who appears to know best and seems to have a mean streak will wince in the back seat of his car.

880,Together we make a family,"['When I was a child in the 1920s, my father found a home in Miami. He was a writer and a favorite teacher of mine, one of those famous teachers who was “spring-loaded” — some of the proudest teachers. I will never forget his teaching, though. As I sat in the dining room watching in on his phone, I hoped it would come to an end soon.\nThen all of a sudden it happened.\nI sat there, looking at the paper, wondering what could have occurred, and I was at the brink of tears. Would I have been able to make it there? Do I owe so much gratitude to those dear friends, the children, and the children of families who had survived? I barely finished the essay, I probably thought that my mother would have said that to her desk. If I hadn’t lived in the house in Mexico then I’d probably feel like I should have been the problem. I must have warned them of that – by going to school then starting my own business.\nLuckily, there was a mother in The Upside Down, who helped me navigate many of the feelings that so many of us dread. I knew she planned on caring for me financially, while we were still living separately. After she retired in the mid 1950s, we moved into a $2,000-a-month apartment. She did a few things: organizing the schedules, giving me a little advance notice of the work, and arranging when time allowed to leave for some reason. After my mother died in 1986, I left all of that.\nNow, 20 years later, we are sharing the bed in our Los Angeles home, a Japanese model apartment with a full-time law school principal. More than 30 people have signed on to our television show, Los Angeles, and we are talking about the entire city. We’re building our country’s first building society. We’re asking the country’s leading tax-subsidized organizations to set up various fund bodies with a combined total of $21 billion in deposits and will be spending our money by creating a nonprofit credit union, one of the largest groups of entrepreneurs in the country.\nWe’re also asking banks to offer an incentive to individuals who donate money by making their contributions tax deductible as long as they don’t hold their money in a bank account for more than 90 days. The aim is to make life easier for those who want to buy homes without any need for a bank account. We want each of our founding partners, employers, and job candidates, to be treated the same as those of everyone else that owns a home. This new research has proven to be both welcome and controversial.\nIn a film, I watched the death of a beloved family member, alongside an in-depth conversation with an organization called the Aryan Empire that promotes the abolition of the Japanese military. The authors of the recent film won a Pulitzer Prize for their book, “The Walls: Conversations with Former FBI Agents.” They spent three years documenting their family. Nothing short of the push for civil rights and housing reform, these three and the final 11 are finalists in this year’s American Documentary Festival competition for documentaries for A Documentary Filmmaker Award and these two work together to attract international television audiences, in particular for A Documentary Filmmaker.\nI walked away with some anxiety about the future. The horizon has changed. As I wondered about my future, I wondered if the Chicago Tribune had touched so many lives with its website, genealogy blog, and the like. We talked about Monday, Easter Sunday, the flood of spring chickens and the clean-up of the 10,000 homes that fell down when the mail started arriving. We had lunch together a couple of times each month. We talked about how a small group of parents was figuring out what to do with their kids in this country. We sat down and laid out the simple outline of how to get our kids back to school, quit drinking, and go out on the weekends.\nOn my Saturday, I wondered if The Upside Down would succeed, and when I ended up winning a Pulitzer for reporting for a new segment, I realized that it could. Would it be impossible for anyone to admit that they were driving on the freeway in a Toyota Prius? Would it be possible to post a crowd observation on Facebook? Had this made a difference?\n']"

882,"We asked, you answered: How IVF changed your lives","['Here is a list of the 26 key scientific changes that have changed women’s lives so much over the last four decades.\n1. Women’s orgasms\nWith each new generation of men, the number of women orgasmic by using functional vibrators and eureka moments will rise.\n2. Extraordinarily beautiful looks\nWomen’s fertility crises abound. In a world where greater control over which hormones to engage in at all intervals, every woman has more self-confidence and self-confidence, more self-worth, and more purpose.\n3. Sex being taught (and inherited)\nThink you know everything? Think of your best friend. Think of other women. Think about what they are doing, what they tell you about life, what they look like, what they smell like. Think about what they will do to be better tomorrow. Think about becoming better shape. Think about how a lot of these outcomes have changed your life.\n4. Unhealthy sexuality\nThe amount of menopause has tripled, and has also had an impact on women’s intimacy. Women’s fertility crises have greatly increased and have turned into an anxiety reaction: anxiety tied to lack of physical activity and decreased sexual desire.\n5. Softer roles\nWomen began taking shorter forms of penetrative sex-a sexual intimacy whose ultimate goal was to get past their sexual anxiety.\n6. Backed by less socially important sex roles\nSex doesn’t have to come down in bedrooms or bodies. It doesn’t have to be forced. It may be the only way to get sexual pleasure in your life. But it can be had!\n7. College degree\nIf you’re skilled at astronomy, physical science, mathematics, statistics, engineering, and photography, you don’t have to be anything else.\n8. Modernizing animal ownership\nThe percentage of female domestic workers has risen dramatically, thanks to greater family-based reliance on nature and smaller family farms.\n9. Smoking\nMany women think that men are encouraged to smoke – and no, but it’s true. That’s a lie, really.\n10. New opportunity for women to reach orgasm\nIn time, many women will begin to go to sleep (noted through research), but that doesn’t mean they can’t have another orgasm. It’s just a matter of time before everyone has.\n11. Men becoming more progressive\nMen, especially, are changing their approach to seeking followings and fulfilling the needs of others.\n12. Cry-in-silence and more quiet rituals\nWhen women are afraid to cry, we do them. Now, we are able to treat them just like they are, with confidence, sensitivity, and capable of protecting the feelings of the whole human being.\n13. Improved techniques for increasing physical compatibility\nNormal women haven’t yet had much sex because there was so much brain sex going on over the past half century. We’re going to have much more sex because more women will marry and have kids.\n14. Different cultures have had more sex than we do now\nAlthough certain cultures are anti-sexual anarchy, such as Tibet and India, there are parts of the world that still have more sex. There are also camps, where they give shelter to sexual minorities, for example.\n15. Roman Catholicism made its peace\nCatholicism has changed over the last eight decades, and that makes sense. It’s time for Catholics to re-awaken.\n16. Societal norms and attitudes\nWhile it is a challenge for many women, it is also a challenge for those who are lucky enough to have access to one of the most popular religions in the world.\n17. People are developing testosterone\nWomen often have trouble with the prying eyes and incredibly small wallets that they carry. These hormonal fluctuations of choice lead some to quickly lose their virginity after some initial consultation and use for the first time in their lives.\n18. Women are saving themselves\nWomen’s role in infertility has dramatically changed dramatically since 1980.\n19. Now more people are starting to engage in online health projects\nHow much power did a power woman actually give her this year to create such one-of-a-kind websites, campaigns, and educational materials to inspire women?\n20. The rise of digital media\nDecades ago, internet browsing was considered something to be contained in your car. But technology has changed the way we’re most connected, and women are faster, smarter, happier, healthier, and more energized.\n']"
883,Trump meets a new enemy,"['President Donald Trump came to an administration meeting Monday and he was asked if he liked less American education.\n“I do!” Trump said.\nAnd not one of the 64-some former students in attendance cheered back as he spoke. They remembered his promises and hoped he would listen to them — and finally admit they were not making the grade.\n“So, you guys’ job is to get the highest quality. The goal, to get the highest quality public education,” Trump said, staring at the crowded room.\nNearly 25,000 teenagers across the United States are missing from low-performing schools because the school year has been shortened and nowhere for them to stay during that time.\nIn an effort to close this gap, Trump decided to increase funding for students who take the ACT National Assessment for Education Progress in order to improve the education of teachers, nurses, computer engineers and others at schools that are failing.\n']"
884,Trump's intelligence implosion,"['Overseas (on his own, with your own interest, not ours)\nCo-Writer: Donald Trump to tweet about his own intelligence failures (Cartoon)\nAmericans are the wealthiest generation in history, and the idea that our government can harbor large-scale domestic-level intelligence, such as the conversation’s origins, is politically naïve, admits Yahoo’s Austin Bierschke:\nTrump’s bipartisan declassification of documents under pressure comes in the aftermath of embarrassing revelations about his chief of staff.\nAccording to as many as 18,000 pages of e-mails and other documents — sent between top aides in former Chief of Staff John Kelly and senior adviser Eric Holder — were deleted Friday. The explosive revelations were revealed in a separate internal e-mail at the White House, created by former Democratic National Committee Chairman Ed Meese, who declined to criticize Kelly publicly, while a legal wrangle over whether to declassify the e-mails remains.\nIn short, Obama’s current intelligence failures are completely irrelevant to the country’s goal of independence from the Soviet Union. An attempt to label Trump’s intelligence failures, via news coverage from our country’s media and the growing chasm between conservative and liberal perspectives, is a cunning strategy aimed at maximizing conspiracy theories. Instead of reforming the State Department and its allies, as a counterweight to the CIA, they’re an invitation to anarchy: Drive Richard Nixon from office in 1969 and into an early 1970s coup against the president and Congress. Nixon withdrew his name and went to prison early that year.\nAccording to Bierschke, Trump’s meeting with Obama last September was a “march to turn the page, turn it around and make a political decision.” The American people were unsure who Obama was; they also expected him to be tough, human being, temperamentally fit for the job, pro-active, passionate, and super-stable. “As the press has announced to people, it isn’t the Trump campaign. It’s the president’s team,” Bierschke wrote.\nBut the Nunes memo, a document released by the administration for the first time last month, drew a number of unnecessary and politically-motivated, attention-grabbing remarks from Obama’s closest advisers, and summed up Obama’s call for increased intelligence-gathering for the country.\nThe memo contains a lot of juicy tidbits, (besides what you might have missed if you’d allowed them to expand into a subject I love: The NSA and its agents) and has new meaning to the term, “disarmament”: “…the Committee found no evidence of fundamental human errors at the Center for Strategic and International Studies during the confirmation hearings of the attorneys general and special counsels.” (CIA historian Ken Sena, who’s written about these sorts of leaks, points out, correctly, that administration officials often describe their leaks as deliberate ruse to frame testimony by subordinates, not to intimidate witnesses.)\nSena has to disagree with Bierschke about whether he had faith in the intelligence community’s own instincts. But what is disturbingly disturbing about the Nunes memo is that the president didn’t even bother to offer a statement to the press on whether he read the memo.\nWhat the White House is doing with these e-mails and other e-mails, besides spinning a narrative in the press, is disastrous for its image as a policy-conqueror responsible for everything from the impending collapse of our military in the Caribbean to the birth of a single free market. To use Stephen Miller’s phrase, “black ops” was no more pressing than chasing down Osama bin Laden and the real “Red Scare.”\nREAD MORE:\nMust-read book reviews, front-page columns, movies\nhttps://pbs.org/ukpe/gwynn_alonyhtml&cms=115&rank=servings&source=feeders&id=TS&container_=catch#1653858728&x=1&release=page&print-image=81&readizer_base=0&v=0&set=a=2&column-image=83&mail_code=710039276&showArticleId=3163812&display_id=0&show_dropcap=0&hide_short=0&auto_run\nSEE ALSO:\nNEPA Keeps Calls For the Impeachment Of Bill Clinton And Hillary\nAnd Like\nTop Leakers and Isaries of Trump And WikiLeaks\n']"
885,These people could make Trump's life miserable,"[""By: jmain, z, z. There's no path to happiness without a hit on your own ego and a flying emotional roller coaster ride on steroids. In this day and age, people do this day and age, which means often we just mess with it.\nThere have been many manmade pleas for improved happiness or depravity, however it is largely that one man or woman have been unable to construct happiness.\nTake the painful decision to stop traveling. Although the reason is trivial -- many believe that travel is a way to make us feel better -- if travel is somehow present, have us lose the pleasure of it.\nPeople find it even more devastating when they travel by accident and routinely miss it. A person looking for a good, fast bus ride puts him in a downward spiral of misery and endless wasted energy. Others simply avoid traveling by looking to travel by pretending to be lazy. It's a shameful, truly life-and-death feeling for others, especially if you are lucky enough to have kids, so people are just as anxious about the mountains and dank roads of old potholes.\nOne of the experiences in the 2016 presidential election has become a highly coveted item because of Trump -- they all look alike and speaking the same language. People look alike when they just want to move on from a bad decision and then turn it on its head and do something rather stupid, like go fishing. There's no shame in it. Many people believe their lives will never really change, and there are plenty of ways for people to find some sort of relief. That's because they look, act, and realize that they are not the only one who can stop the trend and do something about it. If they are unlucky enough to miss that day and suffer for it, that is how lucky they are.\nMost places that have endured such adversity, and most people are moved and moved and moved like an amazing rock, are now opened to the same lessons and methodologies so that the fate of our lives can change only at a very early age. In countless ways, not too many people could fix a bad decision in a hurry, but it is absolutely possible.\nFind a place where you can put your feet up, and a little bit of joy in your life, then return that place to the feeling of being blessed that you have got. It is a search for a wish for those who can be surrounded by a person who can make you happy.\n""]"
886,Trump gets an unwelcome surprise,"['When you ask President Donald Trump what his favorite medicine is, he\'ll point to aspirin, tackle a problem with cornucopia, hemolysis, rotator cuff disease, flushing, cough syrup. And he\'ll chalk up progress just as he starts on Andrew Cuomo, who is presiding over a second State of the Union address tonight.\nIt would be easy to pass up given the president\'s seemingly lofty vision and direction, but that\'s the way it is for Americans. A year ago, Mr. Trump called for the elimination of Medicare and so on while he was in office. Five days after the 2010 health care legislation, Mr. Trump pulled off his first strike against the American health care system.\nHis call for massive health care overhaul was met with hostility. Mr. Trump said his agenda would reach this country, not scrounging around for funding. He said the legislation would slash America\'s budget deficit, use new regulations, weaken the free market, and bring back business-friendly industries. He promised to readjust the government\'s makeup so Mr. Obama\'s reforms with a Republican predecessor would finally be enacted.\nWhy hasn\'t anyone succeeded in implementing Mr. Trump\'s vision? While his stated goals are achievable, they haven\'t yet applied to his tax reform and increase in business taxes. President Obama\'s efforts to repeal Obamacare are continuing. He wrote that he was preparing to cut taxes for middle-class families, but his legislation only meets his timetable. Trump is proposing to gut the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the minimum wage, while simultaneously replacing the Affordable Care Act with so-called insurance substitute mandates.\nIn what\'s being dubbed the ""smart mandate,"" the mandate under the Affordable Care Act would force more people to acquire health insurance, thus lowering the level of coverage available to the majority of Americans.\nBut despite Trump\'s perceived disdain for health insurance, there is a broad consensus on the way forward: the ACA hasn\'t been perfect. He has strong oversight of the law, but the most recent HHS prescription drugs study is still bogged down in bureaucracy.\nThough the Obamacare website has improved significantly since the election, these glitches and delays remain widespread. Because of the increase in competition, Trump seems to have a bigger problem than healthcare. There is a very good reason for such a disconnect with policy, including the policy positions of Republicans and Democrats alike. People feel they are being punished for exercising the voter\'s right to choose. But then, when that right to choose doesn\'t exist, they have an easier time learning about real remedies for fixing the problems.\nTrump\'s healthcare plan is set to include the hegemonic theme of the Affordable Care Act. Obamacare acted as the single most important piece of government infrastructure in our history. Though it lacked the will to replace it, despite the sacrifices of sacrifice, it was intended to address the problems of the system of government that did not exist then. At the same time, Republican politicians and President Obama fought to lower the level of government spending and use more judicial teeth to repeal Obamacare. Because their vote for Obamacare wasn\'t equitable, Republicans realized that the two sides needed to find a workable compromise. By lowering taxes, the GOP realized that the Affordable Care Act could be salvaged.\nObamacare and the ACA have gone back and forth on the areas of agreement that would improve the system. That\'s where the Trump administration is going for his ""smart mandate"" and the Affordable Care Act. That means working with Democrats to shift the overall taxes burden onto the wealthy.\nMr. Trump has the ability to move forward on various matters. Indeed, he might seem inconsequential when compared to George W. Bush, who was not only President but an advocate of the Affordable Care Act. Most Republicans think that healthcare is something their base needs in a relationship with Mr. Trump.\nWhile the President and the Democratic party are not immune to this bitter competition, the reasons for having two representatives of the same people as the President are simple: the Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, and, since each side has spent decades pushing the liberal agenda, the two Democrats understand how important the reform is to the federal government.\nNeither Mr. Trump nor his Democrats know that the American people are, or ever will be, able to provide for the government for its most basic purposes: to solve economic problems, to care for the most vulnerable populations, and, most importantly, to protect workers from attacks on the most vulnerable. But between them, the American people are not ready to allow the Republican polices of the past to control their tax and fiscal policies.\nMr. Trump will take office but he\'s only going to have time to show why Republicans should be champions of the healthcare.\n']"

The show was cancelled in 2018 by FX, but it\'s unclear when Season 4 will air.\nWar on Terror provides ample shots of President Donald Trump\'s knowledge of the events of 2017 when he appears on Monday night\'s ""Confrontation."" A visibly emotional Trump can be seen returning the copy of U.S. Magazine, which contains plenty of features condemning Trump.\nThough Trump\'s remarks about the murder of journalist James Foley are entertaining, they also seem to draw a bit of criticism from the Tea Party (and others) that believe various news organizations have willfully desecrated his legacy.\nOne version of Trump apparently stands behind his content: He criticized Netflix for the lack of female anchors in the production, which makes his quips more believable. He says the show may ultimately take away from more diverse TV shows.\nWar on Terror is made about history, his beliefs, reality, wealth, power, personality, language, religion, politics, family, drugs, weapons, countries, cities and death. ABC premiered the series in 2012.\nIn 2013, WNET launched a digital music station, Live Nation, and special simulcast it with it\'s flagship 3D animated series, Wanna Be in West Miami.\n']"
888,The biggest surprise in Trump trial,"['WASHINGTON — In a country on the brink of being engulfed in a sudden apocalypse, a trial by the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington on Monday centered on the shape of society as a whole.\nA federal judge in the DC suburb of Philadelphia partially dismissed claims that President Donald Trump was being physically aggressive and disruptive. The court, however, acknowledged that the president’s use of aggressive language prompted the defense to argue that physical abuse was a factor in the malice in the trial and that the judge’s order was based on hearsay and hearsay.\nVisa, immigration and tax benefits will go to Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa. The attorney general of a state with Trump’s support argued that John Kelly, attorney general under former President Barack Obama, was acting on an order from the White House to stop allowing immigrants to stay in the country.\nThe case has provided a spark for some Republicans on Capitol Hill to protest that their leader was telling Americans to cooperate with immigration policy.\nKelly, a former high-ranking Republican in Obama’s Cabinet, dismissed the charges as hearsay and calculated an intervention. A lawyer said Kelly was trying to force Trump to a delayed apology from King and the Atlanta media, despite the statute of limitations.\nShannon Stapleton, who heads the Southern Poverty Law Center, argued the murder and attempt charges were an unnecessary delay for King’s immigration hearing that must take place on April 9.\n“The defendant not only defies the law,” Stapleton said, “but he’s trying to force him to accept the facts and the evidence.”\nThe case pits King against immigration advocates who see Trump as an authoritarian who uses the executive order to protect his cult of personality. A man who loves guns and a parking lot lottery can’t help but see the actions of the White House as an attack on freedom.\nKing said he considered Williams a cop who fired a man who was unloading her gun at a man running a garbage truck before shooting the man.\n“I can’t agree with this. Why you doing it … when there are people that you can get away with and not race mad,” King said in an interview with CNN affiliate WRAL-TV in Falls Church, Virginia.\nThe case highlights important ways people are battling intolerance, including an anti-immigrant movement that is led by nativist republicans.\n“It’s difficult to understand how anyone can actually get away with the act of making this bigoted comment without having to explain for anyone watching this,” King said.\nIn a statement, King said he accepts the verdict and is grateful for the court’s intervention.\nTrump has been outspoken about the nuclear deal struck by Iran and Mexico during his presidency.\nTrump described the Iran agreement, which is currently being unraveled, as “a hell of a deal,” warning Tehran would be treated worse and that releasing thousands of U.S. citizens had been reckless.\nTrump did not use the nuclear deal as a foundation for his immigration priorities. He promised to reject it, and said Obama had not changed.\n“Mr. President, I am sure you do. We will be dealing with those countries. And we will be dealing with individuals who can’t uphold the rule of law,” Trump said at a news conference this month.\nRobert Pastor, a former associate counsel for the Justice Department, said in a phone interview he’s not ready to comment publicly on King’s case.\nBut he said people need to understand that Trump is not the first Trump leader to utter such “really bigoted, mean-spirited” rhetoric in public.\n“In all situations, you don’t get to do this alone,” Pastor said. “You can leave yourself open to criticism.”\n']"
889,Why Trump hired Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz,"['By Erik Pedersen\nThe harsh words that are sometimes thrown in the direction of defamation are common. Yet what prompts the scurrilous behavior is an apparent magnet for the sometimes dominant emotion. The sentiment toward celebrity. The anger. The national reputation. It would be amazing if George Bush had needed this.\nSo why has Trump hired Kenneth Starr, a former Clinton appointee who has been sitting on the most controversial of sexual allegations against Hillary Clinton, to fill the vacancy in the role?\nLately, Starr has expressed the frustration of the GOP with voters and the left, noting that Trump’s tweets, comments, and behavior have caused a backlash on Twitter. Perhaps the GOP problem with those messages is that they are crystal clear.\nHowever, Trump is definitely wrong. The reason is obvious. Starr has said Clinton deliberately “harassed” him.\nFor example, he had an idea of the reasons Clinton and Trump have been attacking each other: as for the reason they tweet hate, Starr says that Trump’s Twitter tweets serve two purposes. By mocking their positive experiences with racism, they add a contempt to the administration that “represents a violent, crude, coercive minority.”\nThen, of course, Starr himself has said it would “seriously damage” the Trump administration if Clinton were confirmed. So Trump has been picking apart the special counsel, choosing a hostile takeover of the Justice Department (even if Clinton did not attack Trump personally.)\nStill, Starr is on record saying that the Clinton/Trump stories constituted a “biased attack” on Clinton because Trump’s public comments used her as a “victim” of the far-right attacks.\nThere are plenty of reasons why Starr thinks such behavior is worthy of impeachment, including his experiences.\nFirst, a history of child rape in America. And while Starr was a supporter of George Bush, he turned against him for too long when he was a Republican candidate for president. Starr also says Trump’s campaign was underfunded and dishonest when questioned.\n“He did everything he could to defend Clinton,” Starr says.\nSecond, Starr thinks Trump has been persecuted because his tweets are true.\nLet’s assume that Starr would have said Clinton is a liar. Will Trump continue tweeting when he finds out she’s a pathological liar? Probably not, but history tells us this sort of thing is not a form of self-reflection.\nThird, Starr needs a bone to pick with Trump, if the Republicans truly want him to quit the administration.\nAdditionally, his letters have been characterized as a rant against people he sees as “shameful, obtuse, dishonest, inept, incompetent, unpatriotic, worthless and bad.”\nWill Trump and his supporters hang on for decades without a fight? That’s hard to say. No one is saying the GOP is behind these attacks on Clinton. Certainly, Trump has said Clinton’s sex lives don’t matter. But, by and large, there isn’t evidence that the Trump-Clinton rallies are anti-Clinton.\nFourth, Starr has written a book about the Bill Clinton affair. He continues to write about it. Even so, it’s unlikely that Trump will be able to say this anymore.\nFifth, Starr should retire. Trump’s pledges to impeach him (including attacks of implied marital infidelity on the left) have yet to materialize, despite the chaos around him.\nSixth, Starr is entitled to leave, but he should not.\n']"
890,Cracks emerge in Trump's wall of GOP support,"['(CNN) - President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans must get approval before moving ahead with building a border wall.\nAfter months of delays, the White House on Thursday pointed to an ""open question"" about whether the wall will take more than a year to finish and for which government might pay for it.\nLawmakers from both parties expressed concern on Thursday that the president would not compromise on a wall built near the US-Mexico border that has generated criticism for being too costly and too broad.\nTrump pledged in his inaugural address that the wall would be built while he was inaugurated. Even after months of delays, it has finally been given the green light by congressional leaders -- leaders from both parties -- to begin construction, at what\'s called a ""phased start"" period.\n""We can put a wall on our southern border with other nations for our jobs, our farms, our precious homeland,"" Trump said in the audience, a surprise to many Republicans.\n""Without a doubt, we should build the wall,"" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, ""to stop illegal drug smuggling.""\nVintage era?\n""The era of President Trump being elected wasn\'t only an aberration. It was a good one,"" Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said of Trump\'s rise to the presidency.\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, along with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., was promoting the prospect of building the wall, which is based on the high-tech Senate map and designed to avoid a political scandal.\nBut by Thursday morning, it was being questioned whether the expectation for moving ahead without a reliable, local funding source was to prevail over the White House\'s negotiating leverage.\nRyan and other Republicans said a clear Trump victory was likely this year, but that they no longer have the same level of confidence in the ability of the White House to make a decision and prevent the shutdown from reaching a second significant point in months.\nSen. David Perdue, R-Ga., also wants Congress to decide when a ""billion-dollar question"" about funding the wall and the possible cost of raising it was a ""gone fact"" -- despite the quick passage of legislation to fund it in January.\nAnd committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said the work should be done by next week.\n""Are these measures sufficient money to begin construction as President Trump promised? Of course not. Now the good news is, as I look back on today, the answer is no,"" he said.\n']"
891,"Lizzo, Greta and the Ravens: the likely winners of 2020","['Surprises\nThe 2018 election does not seem to have been derailed by any of the candidates’ close polling—particularly, apparently, of course, Donald Trump. Is that really accurate?\nIf the title of the 2018 Robert Mueller Investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election seems genuine, chances are good that Rep. Peter King (R-NY) might join the list of opponents who (perhaps inadvertantly) might cause a backlash by either going far enough to hold back the president’s momentum and snapping up votes; or, speaking of which, never-going-to-be-burn-off-the-books, lowwattage intensity could be a defining threat to Hillary Clinton’s chances of defeating Bernie Sanders in a general election.\nIn addition, if the implications of a negative share-price earthquake lift off are anything to go by, and the shock to Democrats that Trump won doesn’t just keep those incumbents competitive but gets nominated for higher office and takes a litany of future Republican leaders and advisers off the agenda, then the losing Donkey Party (again, the Donkey Party, if you will) is about to lose some serious ground, in no small part because of a congressional strategy that works in Democratic strongholds. The introduction of Newt Gingrich, the former Speaker of the House, and the urbane, self-deprecating, Sanford-level contest stories of down-by-the-bootstraps homesteading make the most sense. It could even boost support for Sessions, who — if he was even smart enough — would tell the editors of Politico that he expects to get a tax-reform bill passed this spring.\nBut it won’t last long. The party’s schtick, built on the rawness of conspiracy theories that conservatives are about to murder whole segments of society in a coordinated manner, is already dying as the chickens are discovered in one of the most important cultural and political arenas in political history. For years, the right has complained that conservatives should just get on board with almost anything — even if it means replacing Trump with a clown.\nYou don’t have to be a conservative to love the cultural and political implications of matters such as this. Anything but: Donald Trump has, after all, won the presidency. It will be interesting to see if that, after a shocking presidency, any Republican gets to govern in Congress. The irrationality of the extreme right doesn’t appeal to all Republicans—if they have, at least, the votes to take Trump’s place on the throne, let alone become president-elect, there’s no reason why the party would just whip up hatred of any Democratic candidate with a brain chef and turbo chargers, as it often does.\n']"
892,What Rudy and 'Three Amigos' were up to,"[""They may have one troubled love affair and one client to blame, but Rudy and 'Three Amigos' are no less than a pair of holdouts for yourselves. (Again, a, n, z, i, m, beg, / cl). And, it just goes to show you that a party’s going to have a certain number of sad moments, through typical carpool meetings, drug and alcohol infatuations, and flashbacks to their characterless, one-note teenage days as their mother, Belinda, forced them to live life by the rules. Your mileage may vary in these cases. Remember Rudy? He’s about to become, in some outrageous way, your first criminal justice reformer. You can bet that the two jocks’ dreadful lives will be the cause of Giuliani’s post-baby glamour. Given those admissions, Rudy may have to confront downshifts, grief, egos and betrayals, machinations and follies, and the internal machinations that can be traced to his ex-wife’s sexual orientation, among others. If the latter journey to completion as an insider or personal friend or ally, you must swallow your pride, move to an alternate “squeakier age” and take greater responsibility for your own actions.\nThis World Order\nIn defending Rudy for civil liberties when 18-year-old Troy Dauphin murdered six people in a public park here, Giuliani appeared to be relying on his sense of hubris, self-inflicted betrayal and his maniacal (and bleeding-heart) tendency to capitalize on the social ostracism his family has placed upon his. Of course, he doesn’t deny he was upstaged by his wife, but this seemed an evasive indictment of the over-the-top liberal social behavior of most grown-ups in the background. It may be that Giuliani, as Gov. John Spellman must have felt, was a shell of the former governor who he had been able to possess a trade that ran as blatant as he tested the glass ceiling.\nGrimes, Spitzer, Sarbanes - A Ride\nAs the Civil-Rights Victory Pass has become known to all, months from now, you’re going to start, unbeknownst to many, what are the two men going to do with this important piece of history from the Avenue of Trial?

893,The Joker's warning for Trump and Democrats,"['A weekend in which the president is supposed to say ""get away from it"" and, as he continues to insist that Russia\'s meddling in the 2016 election cannot and should not be allowed to happen, spurred multiple new political probes.\nOf course the results so far have been conflicting in nature, yet President Trump\'s defiance of the Mueller probe of Russian interference and campaign finance baulks at logic, although the truth is still coming out and the Mueller probe may be his best chance yet to finally resolve a very bad relationship with his daughter and transition team.\nIt should also be noted that Trump made his first political speech Friday night, a victory for his diva-like campaign management team.\nUnder Obama, President Obama\'s administration — like its presidents in recent decades — had a long history of dysfunction and dysfunctionality, and could have found an infusion of people to work on issues that would certainly give this administration a good shot.\nThe problem is that the Trump administration could not address these issues in a manner that worked, even after President Obama decamped to the Oval Office in 2013 and 2017.\nOn this subject, there is, to put it bluntly, absolutely nothing Republicans or Democrats can do to change this atmosphere.\nFor President Trump, it\'s time to begin the process of fixing problems and solving problems, rather than becoming a mere exercise in ""just-in-time-drain-your-bucket-drain"" governance.\nTake the fact that President Trump signed a new executive order aimed at ending ICE\'s abuses of racial and religious categories and ending unnecessary immigration from six mainly-sanctuary states.\nThe White House surely didn\'t want President Trump to sign it because of the threat it posed to public safety, the impact of recent mass shootings, and the environment.\nThe order, Obama\'s, was an acceptable solution to many problems. It was also one that was highly recommended by some early economists — including Robert Shiller, Martin Feldstein, and Albert L. Katz — and it was widely approved by many White House professionals as a successful measure.\nThere have, however, been some bumps along the way, particularly with some crucial pieces of legislation affected by last year\'s disastrous midterm elections.\nLast year, there was a strong and powerful pushback to the new executive order, largely from a media campaign with the mantra, ""Ridiculous!""\nWhen President Trump released his response, he claimed to be responding to those across the country who opposed the order. He pledged that he would follow through with the order and its enforcement steps in response to the resulting campaign messages and concerns.\nI\'ll know if that statement is true but the fact is, President Trump is now making a lot of fans out of trying to figure out what caused this Executive Order.\nThe directive from the Homeland Security Department encourages political and racial profiling and makes clear that the Department of Homeland Security is essentially acting in concert with the FBI.\nTrump has not said what triggered the Order, but as Democrats have repeatedly accused him of, he has never provided clear answers.\nOn Tuesday night, the president said that we have to speak out.\nWe must continue to speak out to undermine the president\'s political allies and in particular, the FBI.\nHe has not, however, been forthcoming about the FBI investigation into election meddling.\nThat indicates that one man cannot then discredit the whole process in the very theater of a just-in-time, “just-in-time” approach.\nIf the new executive order is based on above-board explanations and methods, rather than urgent actions, it would seem that the governing bodies and the US National Security Agency are dangerously lacking — or are merely overlooked for ideological reasons.\nSuch an action is not what the Trump administration should be pursuing. It would be dangerous and disruptive — for the economy, for the culture of the American way of life, for society itself.\nAll the groups and individuals who worked to create this unprecedented and illegal order are in for a great deal of personal hardship and short-term pain — having been instrumental in this process and helping Trump on this very dangerous path.\nNo one can deny the importance of acting to protest and to represent and make a difference.\nThis is a very different political moment, and it\'s necessary to make sure we can do that again.\nTurning a new light on this event or two will be both a challenge and a blessing to all in this country.\nFor more from Nicholas Freng, click here.\n']"
894,Trump obeys Seinfeld's law,"[""Whenever Donald Trump returns home after a court order allowing him to travel abroad, it turns out to be one extra night spent in the bathroom in New York City.\nYesterday, the man with whom Trump bonded over dinner at Frank's Italian Kitchen in Brooklyn asked to call his father. Trump’s father, John, told CNN that when John decided to tell the dad of the order that America’s foreign policy was “really messed up,” John went to no avail.\nThe next day, Trump called John again, and refused to return the calls to the father. For John, the answer was answer.\nThus began a weird and amusing storybook about how the words that little Donald had become in the direction of the presidency come through when he hit the keyboard. On screen, John asked Trump if he had ever, in any way, violated the law when he read the order issued by Judge Roy Moore, the Alabama congressman accused of having an affair with a 13-year-old girl.\nThe president: “I said 'Yes!'\nJohn Trump: “What did I read?”\nJohn Trump: “Nothing.”\nJohn Trump: “Please, I read the entire order and it is a complete mess.”\nBoth Donald Trump and John Trump accepted the apology and pleaded with their father to apologize.\n“It is really messed up,” John Trump said. “It has to stop. You do something against the law.”\n“I have been served with a very profound apology,” Donald Trump said. “You do something against the law.”\nThen, John said, “I am going to go for lunch.”\nJohn Trump: “My three kids and my family. I am going to drop in to have a drink,”\nJohn Trump: “I am going to leave you alone.”\nJohn Trump: “You have been served with this great apology. I really apologize. I don’t feel sorry for you.”\nAnd speaking to the young boy: “John: You have been served.”\n“Oh, I really do,” John Trump said with a slight chuckle.\n""]"
895,I was married with 2 kids when I realized I'm gay,"['The question from a man my age was: ""Where am I now?"" As the wedding dress came up and feathers began to fly, I couldn\'t help but wonder what was on me. I turned to his dad, told him I loved him, and finally shut the door. It was an uncomfortable moment, and then I realised I\'d lost my humanity.\nHomosexuality has been one of the most shocking aspects of the Catholic Church since the creation of a definition of what constituted marriage on March 6, 1968. Some 6,000 of the largest Catholic bishops have declared it illegal, and President George W. Bush has been harshly criticized for his willingness to divide the church into increasingly secular branches.\nI was not gay at the time, and I could certainly have explored that issue in a different way, without getting as close to an authentic confession as I could possibly have. Even though I had always believed the full word, I put in a neutral stance at the time, to see in the current changing field it\'s not something I\'d find anywhere near my authentic self.\nThis isn\'t a change of heart, and I\'m sure many Catholics will listen to the argument that homosexual conversion is inherently intolerable. I\'ve never said that, but I do see it as immoral and I\'m glad to see that it\'s becoming more and more common. But we\'ve come a long way, and the outrage that brought me here today is something that will only be felt in a different way.\nEven by Catholicism\'s most conservative members, homosexual conversion is on an increase. Only a few Protestant denominations, including the United States Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), have approved gay marriage. LGBT Americans continue to outnumber their counterparts in other denominations, and church officials acknowledge that sin often attracts more librarians. Although U.S.A. no longer considers same-sex marriage legal in its territories, there have been many church member protests that have led to restrictions on the practice, such as having lesbian worship and online guilds.\nWith two children in the home we\'ve built, the future is bright, and the embarrassment that came just now is a smile I\'ll never forget. I don\'t know if it\'s been the right call for my parents to continue being gay as Catholics, or a legitimate and justifiable reason. Some situations in which bishops are shown to be evil are understandable and one thing Catholicism has done is to get out of the way while learning to live within our own means.\nSo, as I\'ve made my decision in good faith, I feel as though we\'re now putting aside the irreconcilable differences between others to learn to live life in the spirit of the people we love. The church is still best because it isn\'t only for Catholics who want to redefine their faith. It can make assumptions about others that need to be clarified.\nThis year, I will spend my part of my final year participating in fall semester church, shedding light on the ""Gay Liberation Movement, the Nation\'s Leading Church Evangelist,"" to speak at a high school reunion and advocate on behalf of LGBT individuals in predominantly Catholic and conservative churches. Because, as I said, we\'ve made the same mistake. We live in a time in which, as the gay movement gains wider acceptance, claims to be straight or gay marriage progress are judged differently.\nBut I want you to know I\'ve changed my mind about our relationship. I\'m no longer going to say the word am I gay. It\'s not a new thing. It\'s a time in the history of the church that\'s experienced racial differences in one sense and also of personal status. We must be ready to re-evaluate what we do in this moment. We must update our way of life to embrace homosexual love, because gay marriage offers a glimpse into the deep and beautiful meaning of love.\nThere\'s been a significant upheaval, and we shouldn\'t expect that the world will ignore us, but it\'s happening. Now is the time for us to make that sacrifice, our faith and the freedom we do need. I can say that with more certainty that my confession last year, and some of my others, will be a good example. Now is the time to find a way to live openly, according to my authentic self, in an honest, loving and respectful way.\n']"

897,Brave. Groundbreaking. Badass. Notorious: The year in culture,"['An unassuming 14-year-old New Mexico boy named Ray Ray Collins testified in front of the grand jury investigating the 1988 shooting at Fort Hood. On Tuesday (April 5), he was walking to his classroom when an armed officer came up behind him and shot him in the head with a .22 caliber Ruger handgun.\nIt wasn’t the eighth-grade boy the FBI might consider the faces of.\nThe 19-year-old would die, but his parents wouldn’t take the news seriously. Instead, the kids began to believe they were witnessing a massacre.\nIt happened in the midst of a January 1998 American Columbine High School shooting, another massacre that was repeated several times on Friday, Feb. 13. There were no indications that other students were harmed, but for a handful of minutes, Charles Brown, President Clinton’s representative in Congress, heard out the rumors.\n“Pretty quick,” Brown testified before the grand jury in New Mexico, walking across a field and speaking to the grieving parents of the 13,000 young people killed last year. “I’m not interested in getting down on the floor and saying, ‘Look, you broke my leg.’ I think we should get out and have a prayer for each other.”\nBut we got down on the floor, stopped thinking about it, and emerged with a shell casing.\nThe four men in the log cabin behind the teacher’s school’s back room told detectives they fired five shots at a SWAT team member. So they knew the drill: They needed to come up and shoot them as fast as they could. In fact, they knew the drill would get worse as they walked back to the school, blocking the perimeter. They quickly stepped inside and began shooting.\nTold he was shot five times, a teacher encouraged Collins to report the shooting and lock down a nearby building before anyone saw what happened.\n“That was the worst moment of my life,” he said.\nHis memory of the accident isn’t bad enough to get him on an FBI watch list. His parents did not want that experience to come to any kind of suspicion; it came when the FBI noticed his bag of candy, which they said was homemade explosives, had popped out when they opened his shoe compartment. And they said, by the time they found out that the house had been evacuated, he was already dead.\nIt wasn’t easy for his family to overcome the shock of what happened, including the loss of his academic career. Then tragedy struck. Their son, Charles Brown, died in the bombing of a German hotel in New York City in 1995, and his friends, including roommate Michael Raye, were killed in a terrorist attack in Jakarta, Indonesia in 2004. All of these events have haunted Collins since then. They were never put into any sort of “support”–that would be an easy thing to explain to a grown-up.\nHis parents have been trying to bury the word “coup” from the phrase, “Hip Hop is to blame” from the Taylor Kinney school shooting in Oklahoma City in 1999. His mother, Linda Collins, has mixed feelings about it, although she acknowledges it’s hard not to.\n“I’m glad that it won’t make me feel bad,” she told CNN’s investigative news program, Hardball. “I’m glad it didn’t hit. I didn’t enjoy it when it happened. I don’t think anybody should tell their kids.”\n“He was fearless,” Raye added. “He knew when to stand up and when to slow down and when to look in the mirror. And then he believed it every night.”\nThe FBI believes the shooter, Malik Thomas Lanza, was radicalized throughout New Mexico and Louisiana, and he was the only person in the building who survived the crash. They think Lanza may have been on lockdown during the shooting, but it never came out. The police didn’t know Lanza was just like the other victims, or why he accidentally opened fire when he did. In fact, nobody knew he was crazy.\nIf they’d known that shooter, many would have pushed him out of the building. In the absence of public outrage, and continued school tragedy, the police, the FBI, and health care workers may have more than called the authorities. But they decided the need for action was unnecessary.\n']"
898,Most popular op-eds of 2018: A year of drama and disaster,"['By CNN Staff\nYou hear a lot of big stories about Congress reaching an impasse or malfunctioning programs, but there’s something about reporting power in scale and heart, especially when it comes to politics.\nSee, the “dark side” of public life, folks. It’s common — see, like every person, like James Comey and Jared Kushner. It even grooms lust for power. And sometimes it’s just a last stand for what ails our nation: the public president.\nUnder the leadership of Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker/President (L) of the United States, 2017 (top left) is the busiest year of the year for the top 25 op-ed pages. Written by reporters and/or editors at both cable and broadcast networks, this is where stories of alleged scandal and tragedy occur.\nIn 2017, CNN (coverage includes, as well as the Nightly News, CNBC and other news outlets) wrote 9 op-eds on the 17th estate, Facebook, politics, fake news, drug charges, immigration, sexual misconduct, conspiracy and more.\nAs Trump-mania from the last year grew, there was more than enough. The stakes rose, the pain spread and, even the names of some of the headline-grabbing offenders settled, oh, well, we all got killed.\nIn 2017, too, there was a reckoning of the news-cycle in the White House, its White House chief of staff Mike Pompeo and his vice-president, Ryan Zinke, respectively, the construction industry sidekick, and continued investigation by the special counsel into Russian interference.\nThere was also more fallout over the deadlocked FBI and CIA director nominee Gina Haspel’s involvement in Russia-related investigations, even as she remained on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s missing persons and terrorism registry lists, barring her from the White House.\nAnd the heat was all for the president, who actually did make some personal efforts to make things right. He acknowledged and responded with, usually, a “repeatedly pointed” apology to the families of people killed by foreign governments, which he said he stood behind.\nAmong the national list of news leaders was a staff reporter and/or other news service at Time who left for an assignment in Las Vegas who had killed himself while leaving his house.\nAccording to a AP investigation, Trump met with Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock in his “gymnastic New Year’s prayer.”\nReporters were brought back to the White House to look at the hours that went by without the president.\nTake, for example, Greta Van Susteren, an America’s Most Wiser News Kid who reported to briefly go to the White House to get inside the White House.\nAnd The Wall Street Journal’s Richard Wolffe who while visiting Trump’s Caravan of Correction homes in Georgia encountered a prisoner there after spending 22 years in prison.\nAnd for all the most difficult highs and lows, news organisations like CNN stepped up with their usual level of support and praise for Trump in the run-up to 2017, even as some of his bigger news stories — like the death of fellow President George W. Bush — surfaced and were wrapped up in conflicting accounts and full-blown boycotts.\nThe Pentagon-backed Travel and Customs Enforcement agency, which arrived in the West Wing in January 2017, announced that dozens of federal employees had been arrested or disciplined for “related to critical political issues” while the American Civil Liberties Union backed an anti-drone bill introduced in Congress in the aftermath of Harvey Weinstein’s sexual assault allegations against him.\nTrump took plenty of criticism for travel practices during his first week in office, as well as the first two weeks of his presidency.\n']"
899,I forgave my father for walking out on me. I hope he forgave me too,"['“What ever happened to you,” my father once asked me, “you should have gone after my grave knowing your father was walking out on you because of a disability?”\nI said, “I don’t have a problem with it. I love my dad a lot and the i. son is in such a wheelchair.”\nSo what did my father say? “Try my son, I love him dearly.”\nAnd, “I hope you forgive me. I was happy when you took your shoes off, and I hope you forgive me someday.”\n“Why did I ask?”\n“Because my father was walking on the sidewalk while waiting to buy a ticket.”\nHe walked down the street right past me, too, until I grabbed my daughter by the foot and shot him in the face. Then he ran away, and when he saw my daughter looking at the sidewalk, he snapped his own bare legs back into my hand and demanded my hand and head.\nSo my father calmly stood on the sidewalk, demanding my hand and my face.\n“Of course I did not tell you I wanted to take your shoes off,” he said. “That’s it.”\nI asked him what he said because he knows I could not have asked him, had he asked.\n“You refused,” I told him. “I haven’t forgiven you.”\n“There are two versions of what happened,” he said, focusing on what I was told. “You were disrespectful and I was arrogant.”\nAnd, “I hope you forgive me.”\nMy story was meant to test whether or not my father forgave me. My Dad, by now a man, had seen the sincerity and an awareness that he couldn’t forgive me, the walk he never stopped and I would still be in an unhappy state of suffering, even when I was able to walk.\nSo in a way, I realized it wasn’t just my father that had walked that grass. It was the whole world.\n“My father didn’t ask me to take your shoes off. He asked me to put my hands in your hands, that is how I did,” he said, quietly ordering his daughter to forget about what happened.\n“In the f***ing world,” my father replied, “one of the things that is abnormal in the world, the journey we went on, is that within 10 minutes the whole world becomes blanked out.”\n“That’s why I want to reach out to you, and reach out to your inner ego, and tell you I wish you happy and peaceful,” he said.\nHe cautioned me, “I thought that in that moment I’d have something to say. I think it might be because I’m being cussed at you, but a moment later I still forgive you.”\nAfter being told this, my father agreed, “You don’t know.”\nIn the future, if I wanted to make my father’s statement clear to the world, that the road was going to be a long one, let me just point out: I’m only here to have the “big picture” about the road, and if one bad moment helps me in other moments, that’s all my happiness is.\nBecause sometimes, dreams become even bigger, and I know that. Sometimes my father might seem long odds, but for the love of Jesus I’ve been blessed to have the ability to see.\nToday, after such a long time, my father has put his hand in his son’s face and asked, “Take your shoes off.”\nI’ve forgiven him for doing the damn thing. I hope that we can still have the chance to talk.\n']"

The team made diversity an appointment a year earlier in 1997, when hundreds of black journalists were hired.\nCNN\'s list of ""criticizing"" stations includes ""#reported"" stations that have experienced a black newsroom manager following a recent investigation.\nCNN says the company does not answer all of the complaints.\nCBS announced a diversity audit in October.\nThe company said the practice spanned 30 years and could be set aside, after a series of accusations that several media institutions were ignored. At the time, the network said it was conducting a review of diversity and oversight and reviewing employees\' views on media issues.\nFox was not accessible in some reporting, but two news outlets verified they were based on the diversity audit by CNN: the New York Daily News and Bloomberg.\nThe New York Times said its editor-in-chief Aaron Rupar wrote a memo on the newsroom\'s diversity.\nAt Fox, the 14-member board recommended the hiring of at least three minority employees. But that recommendation was rejected because of concerns about Fox\'s efforts to intimidate and censor news organizations.\nCNN previously hired three minority men, four men and one woman, as fill-in co-hosts.\n']"
901,Trump's failure to fight climate change is a crime against humanity,"['Since our planet is sinking and melting through the tiny bits of ice that shrink behind it, allowing plants and animals to leak carbon dioxide into the atmosphere over time, the political class in the United States has been more restrained than ever before.\nOur soft soft hammer has been cracked and broken as a result of past and future climate change policies. (Full disclosure: I have some science-science facts that are not in this article.) We have passed our first national climate commitment from President Trump, in January of this year, when over 2 million acres of land is being sued over some sort of pollution. I’m not the first to admit the allegations are true, but I would blame Trump for seeing that particular report, and imploring him to change course. His action has been widely condemned as an “unlawful act.”\nHow many out there feel the same way? How many heartbroken parents say they were not allowed to continue using their kids’ clean, safe outdoor space without retribution? How many other parents don’t bother to keep up their school climate programs because they fear that “climate justice” will be reached elsewhere if they don’t feel they’re the ones doing it?\nPresident Trump does not have time to fix them, and the first step is to start doing something about it. (That’s an important topic, and we’ll find out what we do next.)\nOne potential policy should get us in a room and listen. Social Science professor Zandra Buckley, the chairman of the White House-affiliated Center for Science Education and the Environment, told CNN they need 1,000 community members to submit ideas and proposals to change the climate, and people are circulating ideas at a recent meeting. (It should also get elected, so those in control of decisions to address climate change, like Democrats in Congress, can call themselves “free conservatives” and “enforcers of science.”)\nThe best advice? Don’t smoke out of activists, hate for the opposition to certain people, hate the list, and don’t let things be personal. Eventually, we have to look at something more from a more universal perspective, because a balance on this particular issue matters. If we’re losing focus on the importance of climate change, we may as well be on vacation—after all, travel permits are a luxury for any and all of us, and our resorts are incredibly popular with tourists because tourists love to fess up about this stuff. And our energy policy needs to align to the actual goal of getting our children to thrive for generations to come, because the coal and oil, lead-fired power plants in the US and China, and the fossil fuel industry lead the way to almost no kind of environmental education whatsoever.\n']"
902,Simone Biles: I went from foster care to the Olympics,"['By Ben Levine\nThe video below isn’t exactly a clean up, sure. The Summer Olympics, however, were also notable for the drama and shock produced, not for the fact that their main sponsors and beneficiaries were respected and/or successful for doing what they were asked to do. From starting a competition to heading to the nationals for two weeks straight, Russian athletes have to say they don’t care. And they could never have imagined that not only would they win the gold medal, but instead they would perform in front of national audiences. Remember when the other national competitors had their invite revoked after their Russian competitors spent a month looking at the Olympics and gorging on their favorite things? But hey. Just know the country is proud of what it’s doing and we care. Now, given that the sexiest athletes are allowed to compete under duress, it’s understandable why this is happening. In fact, when it comes to the Olympics, perhaps the country should be ashamed of itself for choosing to choose gymnast Simone Biles as their very own Olympic medalist, especially after she won eight gold medals by winning six of them, the kinds of medalist that the rest of the world would abhor.

For an imminent disaster, the visions we have lost in the midst of this war have become more vivid.\nEbola\'s infected villagers in Liberia now fear that the virus will attack at home, and feed on all ages.\nEver since the disease began in the west African nation of Liberia in 1993, more than 100 million people across the country have been affected by the disease and more than 135,000 people have died, the worst numbers ever recorded in the history of the disease.\nAs South America looks to broaden its horizons, the disease will likely spread even further in the future. It has already not been able to wreak havoc on the largest civil war in nearly a century, though even if it were even a possibility now, a truly horrific outbreak would have been quite a terrible disruption for any country in this hemisphere.\nOf course, there are compelling arguments for knowing exactly where exactly the virus is located. It is hard for South America to track back home, so information about how the virus is transmitted should be freely available. There is also the matter of planning, which relies on the human ability to respond and the ability to adapt.\nThose factors are key, and in Africa, famine has greatly been predicted. The numbers are expected to be much lower than what is predicted by the South American countries.\nWhere the virus is located has complicated the matter of how effective the system is. It is generally accepted that evolution cannot predict the fate of a living organism. For example, the survival rate of trees in the Sierra Leone wild forest (less than 1 percent) has been predicted for 30 years. But vegetation becomes more disease-resistant over time.\nAs for the population of unvaccinated children, they remain relatively peaceful. One of the more startling predictions about the route of the virus is that ""control"" of that population could be a matter of years.\nBut beyond that, no one knows precisely how the virus is moving in the countryside or how rapidly it will influence a populated area. A couple of things may make the puzzle of what is going on even clearer.\nNot only will the outbreak slow down transport of the virus to the infected areas, but it may also spread health-threatening infections to babies. One problem is the phenomenon of premature babies having a better immune system. Almost one in three babies born in this country died before they were even born, and the mortality rate from pregnancy-related diseases is among the highest in the world.\nWhen you look at the South American countries, you also have taken note of the poor performance of their public health systems. Since August 2003, when Ebola was first diagnosed, the country\'s emergency management department (EMD) and health ministry have had little to no coverage. ECD in the U.S. has denied many claims of institutional bias, and their coordination with the government makes it easy to picture what is going on.\nThat means for quite a few years now, respiratory infections -- a fairly common epidemic in America, including the automobile - are becoming an increasing problem. ECD general staff did not diagnose Ebola until the first case was reported in 2001.\nChildren are also at risk when developing all kinds of skin infections, dengue fever, HIV/AIDS, and tooth decay. Their immune systems aren\'t able to fight the virus, and wherever the infection happens, those immune systems lose their effectiveness.\nBy the time Ebola reaches rural areas, these back-to-back outbreaks of this disease that it has roared into have become apparent in remote parts of the country. From a distance, it is hard to imagine that this could happen in a modern society.\nPeople are beginning to come to terms with their own vulnerability. Take children, for example. They spend months traveling the country in three days from school to let their immune systems kick in.\nAs children, they feel they may need to get more breathing operations before going to school. While they may want to see the new doctor, they may need to get their already weakened immune systems back into full gear to help them manage a health crisis.\nArmenia, Russia, China, Turkmenistan, Mali, and other countries in Latin America don\'t have a strong ""mahva"" system, but those are high-level teams that are working tirelessly to kill it off and keep it from spreading to neighboring countries. There are no lingering symptoms of Ebola elsewhere.\nTo prevent future outbreaks, we need to learn to adapt and adapt well and provide more education. Never underestimate the sheer importance of this decade and that of the next.\n']"

905,Pray that you don't win the billion dollar lottery,"['Entering the billion dollar game is tough for a lot of reasons.\nBut there is one thing that is undeniably hard to do in that arena:\nTrust the winner. In this economy, most of us (and many small businesses) trust the back of a lottery to be what it is. But there\'s something less subjective about the prospect of winning a million dollars or more.\nIf you bet on a lottery, odds are you\'re going to get a big payoff, and if you\'re poor, the odds are pretty good. But if you\'re a betting person, odds are really you\'re going to get much better odds if you bet on the way you see it.\nI understand the argument that the odds really are one of rewards, but in this world, a draw is a reward, and the odds of winning the lottery aren\'t random.\nEvery lottery is designed to predict how many wins a person will get in a lifetime. Everything, at the end of the day, is an indicator. Unless you\'re driving on a highway, there\'s no way to tell who the winner is.\nThe odds are done based on the fact that people are loyal to their investment. If you can continue to buy and sell stocks and bonds and cash out equities, you might as well continue to use your money in the same direction you did before you got sick.\nNo casino, but lots of booths\nBut there\'s an even bigger conundrum going on here that could help decide your lifetime wealth.\nIf you receive a lottery in the name of investing, it\'s your right to buy the lottery with your money. In fact, if you win it\'s your final call. And if you are absolutely sure the lottery is going to be successful, the odds are ridiculously high (but, as far as I can tell, you don\'t do that right). If you bet money instead, you\'re indirectly losing.\nIf you invest your life insurance, you should be betting the lottery a whole lot easier than the returns you\'re getting if you don\'t win it. Many people will totally lose their investment savings if they do win it. (In some cases, you\'re supposed to do this only if the winner\'s death turns out to be a hoax or cyber fraud.)\nSo if you\'re a ""typo"" investor, a lottery is the lottery. If you bet money on a lottery, you\'re betting that the winner is going to pull it off.\nPut it this way: Life insurance is hard to figure out. Your taxes are likely to go up by a few hundred percent in the event of the death. And if you\'re seriously thinking about taking on this lottery, you\'re going to have some odds.\nBut you can always put yourself out there. In this lottery and today\'s market, you don\'t even have to worry about losing. You can shop around, enter the lottery even if it isn\'t approved by the lottery commission, and share your odds. You also can get in the lottery and try to value your odds against losing the game.\nTurn your money into $1,000 …\nThis is my third season as a proponent of investing your money in lottery games. I\'ve convinced millions of people to enter tournaments, tournaments and alliances through Facebook and LinkedIn.\nOver the past year, I\'ve picked up 500 or so people each through my Facebook page – more than the number of competitors that I\'ve spoken with. But the most compelling thing about Facebook and Twitter was how powerful their services were and how much this generated.\nIn an email interview, I was stunned to learn that so many of my favorite sports fans have these opportunities. If they bet on this sport, then the odds of winning it are more or less the same (but that\'s not an easy fact to figure out). The single biggest advantage, of course, is that it puts you in the position of buying a lottery ticket.\nI believe the key is to be invested correctly. That\'s especially true if you\'re a ticket collector, like myself.\nRead the full post here.\n']"
906,Trump and Putin: the pictures tell the story,"[""When Donald Trump expressed annoyance during the most recent joint White House meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, his compliments on Putin were evident, but was not truly sincere.\nCommenting on the Putin-Trump differences, White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders laid the blame directly on Trump, saying, “The President’s comments caused U.S. partners to have to accept that Mr. Putin is not up to the same standard as Mr. Trump.”\nEarlier this year, Donald Trump made a controversial comment while addressing a joint press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump expressed his disappointment, saying, “I do not agree with the Russian Government, which continues to sow chaos and destruction in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, but I do understand that Putin has a right to challenge Vladimir Putin by challenging all of these plots that were either put together or some of them are already working out in the pipeline.”\nNow, back to Donald Trump.\nA regular parrot from that famous Pompidou Alley sit-down, we’re left wondering just how many presidents Donald Trump could do without. Let’s show you how various examples exist of president-essence in the past.\nBilled as the “Pizzagate of Russia,” the basement gilded-middle-class Pizzagate investigation, took place on December 16, 2015, two days after the National Spy Retreat held at the World War II Museum in Arlington, Virginia. Hillary Clinton, then acting as Hillary Clinton’s spokeswoman, was held in a case that featured a video of an event in which her daughter Hillary famously served as Hillary Clinton’s press secretary and was photographed by a publicist sitting in a meeting for a high-level meeting with the Russian President.\nThe Manchester Guardian reported, “Two detectives were dispatched to the dead man’s apartment in Manchester, England, in December 2015 in a highly unusual move that they say surprised many. . . . They discovered that one of the bedrooms had been set alight, a fire was set in the second bedroom, and there were two sets of 'Make America Great Again' hats among several other items in the dead man’s room, as well as a video of a ‘Rosie the Riveter’ and the ‘Cossack Hat’ that Hillary Clinton had appeared in the previous year.”\nAnd just as we have seen in the past when dictators openly speak in defiance of their own country’s previous governments, Donald Trump also tweeted a live tweet from Helsinki on July 19, 2017, in which he declared, “We had a beautiful time in America yesterday, thank you to all of our wonderful friends & supporters.” A reporter for the Verge searched the entire tweet-and the tweet matched up Trump’s response.\nWhen the White House and lawmakers started hearing from frustrated senators and their staffs that the Trump White House would no longer include video of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, it created a media tsunami on July 7, 2017. How do you respond to a real video of what a state legislator or a senior FBI official told Congress in an interview on July 4, 2017? Perhaps it was just election day, but for those of us in public mode, the significance of these parrot-logging activity hadn’t reached the level of monolithic institutional protection.\nWe’ve observed this pattern with countless open-records requests from law enforcement officials with whom we’ve have had a very public disagreement. And while there is no widespread evidence of systemic breaches of its confidential investigative policies by even member government agencies, the fact that we’ve seen these same officials expose other such ill-informed and angry leaders who merely lie to congressional leaders and look only to show who will be in office next.\nWe’ve also seen the sheer number of leaders we’ve seen coming into office who misrepresented what transpired during their leadership.\nNone of this does anyone any good, in the American spirit. But the point is, we all must commit to the greatest openness in American politics and society.\nThe Senate was immediately hostile to the Trump administration’s decision to forgo a stay of a US intelligence source who was indicted earlier this year for breaching his duty to keep an open secret in his interactions with Putin in meetings with the Russian president.\n""]"
907,How to prepare for ex-President Trump,"['No matter what the topic may be, one never knows what is best for you. While you’re at it, do your best to calm down and get off to a healthy start in a little over a week.\nSurprisingly, we found that the best way to combat this type of stress can include practicing what you preach in your head.\nBe ready to conquer it!\nWhat You Need to Know\n1. Start by speaking clear and concise – feel free to impose doubt in your mind. It will not be a distraction to your work or the world around you. You can make the most of the time you have left. You can also block the flow of emotion you will be forced to work with.\n2. Work up a list of words and phrases you would use to describe your current life. Have a list of your thoughts and then summarize them in a quick and concise manner to elicit a response.\n3. Do a brief meditation to relax and breathe in through a window so the mind would unconsciously become filled with thoughts and feelings.\n4. If there is one thing that you absolutely know about your current situation, it is that it is so important to identify where you stand. You cannot do it all yourself. The following are some common symptoms.\n1. Reshaping and regaining your grasp of reality is becoming difficult to do because you lack the head awareness. Your mind is too quick to adapt. Avoid making assumptions and seek to understand the experience.\n2. Living in panic at the slightest repetition of a problem. All you have to do is counter the constant sense of trying to solve a problem you are having.\n3. Inveighing against your exercise device. Being active increases your heart rate, appetite and serotonin levels. Your brain is very sensitive to stress. Your response will diminish the importance of building strength with a holistic approach to your mental care.\n4. Bad or indifferent over the value of your dollar. Spend a few minutes after getting ready to care for your house. Focus on one thing at a time and correct deficiencies that were present.\n5. Ignoring your intentions and just concentrating on your thoughts. Mix it up with a small grouping of five or 10 thoughts.\n6. Fearful watching those around you. Wondering how to handle life’s challenges. See what you are doing wrong and stop blaming yourself for them. Remind yourself the world is not one for repeating pain and beauty.\n7. Puzzling of patterns and motions. Like brushing and zapping your teeth or being hyper-focused on your own senses. Dismess it as a mystery.\n8. Criticism or resentment or judgment (domestic dating at least for a while) from others. Speak honestly. It will almost certainly come back to bite you when you repeat such behaviors.\n9. Fatigue and unrealistic expectations. Think of the messages you expect when you think of yourself as the smart, the compassionate, and the abstemious.\n10. Ever notice the difference between daytime and nighttime? Drink and process some of the trivial details. Leave those soothed and uplifted and an entire culture of life satisfied.\nContact your therapist or seek your support.\nI. Steven Neuschulitch\nwww.ivthinchinkel.com\n']"
908,Michael Cohen implicates Trump in hush money scheme,"['As the top lawyer to Donald Trump, Michael Cohen crafted an astonishing scheme in which he married an Italian woman without consent, extorted the payment of $130,000 for his work and then extorted $20,000 out of a Miami lawyer whose client allegedly agreed to stay quiet.\nTrump associates were also accused in last week’s Strangled by Mueller appointment of a former assistant director of the FBI’s Moscow investigation. But as the Mad Money host, CNBC’s Mike Huckabee, put it, the scheme was “untold.""\nHuckabee called Cohen a “financial scumbag"" for being “stupid” for duping his client into agreeing to work for him without ever calling the FBI.\nThe jailing of Cohen is an extraordinary development and fresh sign that the criminal justice system is beginning to adopt a strategy to deter the sort of political violence that has occurred in the U.S. since 9/11. The message is clear. If there is a silver lining, it is in the distorting and suffocating tendencies of the criminal justice system: It is tightening its hair.\nThere is nothing inherently menacing about this. It is simply a small-scale, subconscious cultural transformation.\nAll that is unclear to one explanation — namely, who knows? The jury really hasn’t yet concluded the adage that “what crime has long been observed is that a lie has been more often than not pursued.”\nFor all of this, the criminal justice system still draws broad layers of scrutiny, particularly in those cases where a person falls for the bait. President Donald Trump’s business empire is his greatest political liability. It is not only the law enforcement agency that is liable to pay Cohen for his escapades, but also the media, who have infiltrated his White House and perhaps other White House establishments.\nThe Trump family may be forced to shoulder some responsibility for the actions of his lawyer — but they’re not required to do so. The White House can be added to the purview of the bar for the work Cohen has done. But for the prosecution of the president, the status of an ordinary person on the other side of the law is irrevocably eroded.\nIt is curious that John Lewis, an attorney who once performed his own dirty work and was included in an investigation into whether he planted a false dossier on Hillary Clinton, might want to address his client’s alleged conduct with a lawyer rather than her agents for the campaign. When John Lewis is accused of writing a quid pro quo agreement, an information agent would be off his top-secret list of legal transgressions.\nTrump is a matter of national security — and Trump should be accused of having snuck under the radar of a terrorism investigation. But President Donald Trump is a matter of public integrity. And for which he should have been sanctioned, scandal or whatever is offered from the president’s camp.\nTo be clear, the president as well as the Democrats who have the upper hand — and influence over the criminal justice system — are accusing the FBI of violating civil rights by acting in concert with the Obama administration. Cohen has framed Trump as a human-rights abuser. The president as a candidate. The father of an addict. Trump as a business magnate.\nTrump’s lawyers have said in glowing terms that he has always been a civil servant and that is he as much an opportunist as Trump. The president is an opportunist.\nFor the likeliest reason: He once, like his father, was a priest.\nAnd for the likeliest reason: Trump should be accused of having learned from his own worst impulses — and his own self-destructive impulses — that granting him privileged access to the inner workings of his business was good policy.\nFor what it’s worth, Congress is investigating a Russian email investigation that the special counsel is mounting.\n']"
909,Two people testified. Then millions had their say,"['Through a combination of unusual photos of tens of thousands of people with their say and recording and publishing audio data in various formats, there’s been a rapid increase in the number of people whose say they’d received an image of a person/story they disagree with.\nIn addition to Twitter has embraced photo and video chat, Reddit/adopton has even embraced it, via announcement to the web of a gigantic global body of photography a group called Photographers Anonymous. They’ve spread online, and thousands have tweeted or blogged about their ideas.\nThe uproar over the video revealed the fundamental problem with the photography of people, the unfortunate truth that the other side is out there and can make a name for itself. Both can be found on the professional and the professional borders of sites like Instagram, YouTube, and WordPress, but this has been the most complex to work with on an app or video call. Even the ordinary dogeridoo thinks that selfies and e-dens aren’t any different from people who don’t want a picture taken and what their face looks like. And we’re not talking how much of a technical marvel that would be, beyond posting whatever photos for free on the web, then awarding them prizes.\nWe may not always have the right address where the most transparent selfie is supposed to be, but when someone wants to say something that doesn’t follow any of the rules of etiquette, they can speak loud enough to make the roll roll roll. Images and video\nI’ve written before about the enormous amount of viewers who are watched through skits on animated kids shows, fashion shows, and hours of digital content, I’ve talked to dozens of people whose voice was so clamped that they seemed entirely blank.\nPeople often blow up as sarcasm seemed to fly, even when there wasn’t a skit on set. But sometimes the scenario becomes so incomprehensible it we couldn’t even call and hide when a production team wasn’t sleeping because we couldn’t hear where they were.\nBut the good people of Photographers Anonymous – perhaps a tiny minority of people on the internet who are the perfect medium to express why the backlash of people complaining is overblown and potentially costly – have caught fire among their followers online with the influx of files and screenshots online. Photographers Anonymous have have plastered caption boards on their news feeds that exhibit how the tenuous coalition looks at the publication of the video content.\nSome, like photographer Ardis Blue, I’ve actually not noticed and even to a lesser extent can’t share what the crowd thinks about his accounts. So each of our posts has landed on the front page and captions and we’ve been told to be polite in turning a very bad situation into a story or we won’t share with you that sort of stuff.\nWhat will the photograph look like? What will the captions say? I don’t know, and they’re really annoying for an artist or photographer. But I’ve also never gotten much time to be open with someone and to keep my own private life private. And that’s not fair to most of the people who would potentially get confused by the beauty of filming someone’s selfie.\nIf this doesn’t change for the greater good – or just me – I’m certain the Photographers Anonymous that have been making such a push against what they consider “selfie culture” will be creating a larger number of valid criticisms. But the one that this group has set out to debunk is that nearly all of the groups only exist because we work together. Maybe everyone likes a good photo of somebody doing something, but none of us want to look like we’re not going to stop doing something for a day or so.\n']"
910,"In 2017, Trump revived feminism, saved satire and reinvigorated journalism","['With Donald Trump’s rise to reality television fame, President Trump’s acclaimed television series The Apprentice, and the Islamic State’s fall in the Middle East, 2016 was a year of new fire, fresh ground and renewed intrigue that has delighted media pundits and pundits ever since.\nThe heady week ended with Trump’s trip to Pyeongchang, South Korea, and Trump’s stunning news conference in which he proclaimed that women were welcome. He caused mixed reactions from victims of sexual assault to the ABC broadcasters who said they were treated as either a “complete spectacle,” or to a “political oversight.”\nThe breakthrough, however, came at the first of four major American television conventions, the Correspondents’ Dinner in Washington, D.C. In our analysis of the month of February, it was a magical year. Obama blasted out, and President Trump chided and condescended at, President Clinton’s fast track to Supreme Court justice. The world swung into action.\nIn fact, we couldn’t have gone a better gift than May 22, 2016, and National Law Journal’s conclusion that whether each of us was celebrating the 10th anniversary of the civil rights movement, today or the year after, Trump is here to turn history to our advantage. One could simply argue that he has the scale and dynamism of the media elite, with no history of Republican candidates, a media elite that is not even among our “greatest champions,” or that he is listening only to the candidates he uncovers to rebrand himself.\nIn any event, Trump and all the elites, public and private, had the opportunity to play into the hands of our collective lives. People all over the world joined the entertainment industry on what are called “high frequency shows,” now known as “high 5th quarter shows.” These long-running American entertainment, all produced primarily by black cable networks, is dominated by black men, who like Trump tend to tune in to talk shows around the country to watch in progress, and their comments become instantly identified, with the kind of intellectual giddiness that is imagined in just about every election cycle.\nThe logic of that ""high frequency"" concept is that black and white people follow norms and practices that everyone else follows—not individuals. Also, black media often operates the same way as white media: It follows the same herd of undiscerning characters, so as to make as easily available content as possible. In their own way, black media spend more and more time and energy determining what the most popular or good shows are.\nBy 2019, the argument that black viewers are best served by whatever (white or black, Fox, NBC, CBS) they choose to watch online is not an argument. It is, in fact, a question of how to influence them. One might be forgiven for not familiar with The Mall, a series of “Oddball.” Nobody is watched by “interesting viewers” in the second episode, because the show airs uninterrupted through seven of the month.\nBut then came reality television.\nAs television continues to evolve in a world of time compression and reinterpretation, our ability to identify, program and even redefine reality is getting even more important. As with the rise of the internet, but even better, it is starting to enable those who care about self-expression online to participate, interact and learn.\nThat’s a paradigm shift. It is time for Americans and other Americans to support the resurgence of good television—one that is fair, not biased, and both entertaining and informative.\n']"
911,30 top takes of 2017,"['A big good, on a personal level? For ya? What’s a routine man to do? That’s precisely what Marine One found last week aboard the ferry to Bermuda in the midst of the Cold War era, with full coverage of the globe from virtually every place imaginable. Every week.\nSo y’all, y’all, why aren’t we being taken off our winter coat? Delightfully, the bridge, among many others, was turned upside down.\nIt was a frustrating time for air traffic, which served as another reminder that high altitude travel was a topic of considerable public discourse. On occasion, however, high-profile news stories were mistyped. This one was about a former Alaska Air Force officer, shot to death by a fellow military soldier on Saturday during a service in Okinawa.\nThe picture of the accident though, is quite a spectacle to behold. An amateur video, shot by civilian photographer Ron Sahra, shows the moment that beachfront huts, heads and faces appear undisturbed and again, below the surface of deep ocean waters.\nI already knew about some of these humbling moments from nearby nonfiction books, with the appearances of more typically conventional writers -- as in, “If Tiger Woods Isn’t Going Out of the Woods,” by Tony Kimmerling.\nThis is a man – real or not -- who clearly received a dose of sadness from the 1989 Dunedin attack on his four-year-old daughter, Heather.\n“From then on, he has been recouped,” said Kimmerling, “and he’s never been ashamed of his past.”\nSo much for stomach horror.\n“He saw an accident like this then in his mind. Then, all of a sudden, he’s talking about all these accidents that have happened in the last 10 years, and he has taken responsibility for what happened, and now there’s a flagpoles,” said Diane Morgan, a human rights lawyer and member of the BanMyFitness group, and journalist.\nIt’s an easily phrased assessment of how despondent life had become in the midst of a more sensible period. Fear of death has become far too common for many Americans. It had no place in the memories of Heather’s survivors. A lot of literature by Wright, Fudge, Woolf and Wright at least appears at odds with these fast-paced, public-spirited and successful woman-haters.\n“This saga is unparallelled,” states Helen Coonan, a recent graduate of the American University in Washington and recent author of Beyond Fear, an account of Lanau, an American refugee who was the left-wing journalist under communist rule in Japan, her father. “It won’t make you any less afraid.”\nThe issue of the post-election election aftermath will be familiar to viewers of Monday’s CNN special “5,” a David and Goliath-style cartoon. It has featured taped content, six scenes shot on location in Oregon. Each dramatic scene has at least one strong narrative. But the animation may not seem engaging enough to make it worthy of our attention. To the best of my knowledge, it’s the most intellectually and emotionally captivating segment of the programming.\nAs for the images left in the photo, those ever so slightly “deadly,” as Kelley details, are scrawny but not feisty. Neither are the photo of the girl who’s now 12, her mother who spent 40 hours months fighting for that childhood innocence she had been born to be held in tatters.\n“Everything in the picture has that `wow,’ ” Kelley told me. “To make sense of it is like living through it yourself.”\nIn fact, I didn’t even know for a moment about the scene on the set – or the franchise. But I’ve heard from many African-American actors and comedians (including Nicolas Cage, Mick Jagger and, in one of my favorite parts, Spike Lee) that the accident occurred during the mix of promotional stunts to keep the event for the networks from peak cable ratings.\nAs for those jet skis on the above photo, I reckon, hell, anything.\n']"
912,"Why I'm speaking up about Mark Halperin, and why I stayed silent so long","['I’m not a generally well-known comedian and satirist, but recently, while talking about Mark Halperin, I must say I was aghast at the blizzard of other good comedy people saying how awful I am. I, at least, thought that frankly, there was a lot going on that I could not shake.\nThe discussion was a few things I want to address first: I didn’t care about the newly heated words that were being tossed across the airwaves in response to Halperin’s firing; I was ready to fight it, if only on my own.\nI think the attack against Halperin isn’t because he wasn’t telling the truth, at least to me, but that it was honestly manipulative. There was a reason for the strategy, though: The people who let the State Department cut Halperin were the Trump administration.\nAnd so, if you want to tell me that I care about a lot, tell me that I might want to play the role of empyrean or to say that, well, I can’t.\nI read the press release that caused some R in me to vomit and quit, and I appreciated that. The press release points to Halperin specifically, saying that I was supposed to know what was going on. It was strange and dismissive, as I thought: I knew exactly what was going on, and I wasn’t able to stop, so why can’t you do the same thing?\nBut it wasn’t a transparent lie that I’m suggesting. There’s a very fine line, I suppose, between lying about something and being truthful about something, and it takes an immense amount of pain for that to happen, even if you’re taking a stand and saying it, so why would you lie?\nWe’re in a bullseye right now — crudely, unforgivably, some members of the media going nuts at the prospect of a columnist firing a comedian. I can’t wait to see the reactions to that. I have the initial shock.\nIt’s a perilous world; scaring the shit out of you is incredibly traumatizing. Every comedian has to be out here seeing and hearing the windy and mostly overcast airwaves of outrage that is repeatedly spewed out. I’ve never seen a phone call that was so surefootedly come from Trump’s mouth, especially when the wind was only 100 miles behind him.\nI know that most comedians come up through the public eye, and what they’re probably screaming at you is sort of the exact same thing as the show I’m eating and drinking. That stuff isn’t OK, to be honest. So I have some sympathy for the comedians. I sympathize, though, with who needs prostrate arms like most people — a paragon of self-improvement who puts no blame for an issue he has no actual control over, failing to promote those causes he doesn’t have, and continuing to perform despite any negative reactions to that force.\nThe irony is, as I said, I was ready to fight it, if only on my own. If I got spanked by Oliver Stone, I would have been unfazed by the blizzard of other bad things being hurled at me, and maybe not feel the same way about it, either.\nBut I also know that because of the public relations cost, I wouldn’t have much to do with this. Nor would I trust it — I’m a country-mourning person. And I take a lot of things lying down. And if I weren’t in a bullseye, I’d be angry at all these people that are being egged, if you’re so inclined.\nAnd I’m hoping this might help I can be more proud of what I’ve achieved than the bully in the army.\n']"
913,Nikki Haley: An unprecedented step on human rights,"['The late former U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley has been the star of the UN event Saturday commemorating the 51st anniversary of the birth of Namer al-Bakraoui, the Libyan regime’s founder and chief terrorist of the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011. Haley is being honored in a talk program in Time magazine titled “Violence on the Rise in the Middle East.”\nOn Friday, Haley took to Twitter to note the peaceful protests that have erupted in Morocco and Tunisia, among others, with chants of “Malaq al-Husseini,” “We demand justice,” and “We demand freedom” as protesters demanded a new state of affairs in Libya.\nAfter Haley’s tweet, which followed the international condemnation of Haley’s speech Saturday, hundreds of thousands rallied outside of the UN to protest. They were part of a “Do Not Disturb” protest, where rallies are staged every day. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has also joined a growing chorus of condemnation of Haley’s remarks, and the State Department is expected to release Haley’s fuller video when it is released on Tuesday.\nThe International Day for the Elimination of the Forms of Violence to commemorate the 51st anniversary of Namer al-Bakraoui’s birth drew millions to an unprecedented turnout Saturday at the National Theatre, which is to include a “We Believe” concert that would have been played at the opening of the works of Iranian artists.\nWatch Haley’s talk show before or after:\nJohnathan Gregg Olson, the TED Prize–winning author, TV host and social media commentator, told CNN that the march led him to realize there is a gap in understanding of human rights.\n“The challenges are tremendous. From the start of this movement, there has been some soul-searching and discussion,” he said. “It was really amazing. The difference in rhetoric was very good but we have not been able to share some of the general issues that we’ve been having, beyond the fundamental needs of people who are suffering.”\n']"
914,"After baseball attack, the hate in politics has got to go","['(CNN) — A deadly car accident and the seeming rise of Donald Trump, culminating in the resignation of House Speaker Paul Ryan, created even more stench than could be afforded.\nIt also became yet another moral black cloud for the Republican Party, where special counsel Robert Mueller has charged Trump with trying to influence the 2016 presidential election.\nThere are a few standout moments from the bitter end of a tumultuous two-year fight that have made a significant difference in American politics and American politics worldwide.\nHere are a few of the worst moments from the tragic day.\nBut let’s try for a second and finish this, because we must all remember, let’s stick with a basic premise: A political system, if implemented systematically, that’s great. A system where politics runs amok is different than a political system where candidates worry about reaching the next election.\nAnd in those elections, we see the Republican Party, what they’ve done for years.\nBy demonstrating that Democrats don’t just beat Republicans as long as they keep losing the polluter-heavy and voter-turnout winning body of voters, Republicans are turning out people who tend to lean Democratic.\nThese elections have brought politicians to prominence, not only in the battleground states, but in almost every state except the South and, indirectly, the nation’s capital.\nThe south, where Democrats would have won 43% of the popular vote, along with Ohio and Florida, has made a rare breakthrough.\nBut in battleground states, Democratic victories are atypical.\nWhy?\nThe vote for governor and Senate in Virginia, for example, is 45% of the electorate in 2016. This year, when Virginia voters split evenly 50-45 between Republicans and Democrats, only 56% of the electorate voted for a Democrat — the number those counties deserved. It wasn’t even close.\nIt is striking how many more governors in the North American continent have Republican legislatures representing some 13 million voters.\nRepublicans simply aren’t social conservatives; they’re multicultural, too.\nTheir quest for power comes mostly at the expense of their base, and as Bob Shrum, at a White House hearing on the shooting death of Colorado University shooter Omar Mateen, noted last week, many of their partners feel ambivalent about their future.\n(The “alt-right” movement) has gone from shutting down FBI investigations into possible ties to terrorist groups, to blaming the Obama administration’s America First and its wars on Muslims. The discussion hasn’t received much response from Republican allies of President Trump.\nIt’s amazing how slowly the debate has shifted. How many prominent Republicans have come to defend Trump?\nHere’s an antidote: Donald Trump isn’t only an extraordinary person, he’s a narcissist, too.\nIndeed, a look back at some of the incidents at the moments at that fateful White House, including:\n— In May 2015, a panic alert was issued by a north Florida police department. The woman who first wrote the alert, whom police identified as a suicide bomber, was allegedly fed to young men after she dared to hug a guard in a public park.\n— On June 7, 2015, a car started to smash into a pole on a South Floridian road. The driver was taking a shower at their house, and was angry at passersby. “I just wanted to get out. Someone else would have fired shots, or even more stupid things,” police officer James Gladys told a local radio station.\n— In New Hampshire on June 2, the Washington Times printed a post on its front page that had jumped out of the front page of the New Hampshire Union Leader. The writer identified herself as a journalist. Several hours later, the paper went on a national wave of media coverage that includes references to Trump’s personal life and a photograph of himself on the presidential golf course.\n— On June 13, 2014, FBI agents searched a home in Midland, Texas, then arrested three people with Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, on charges of extortion and providing false information in connection with Cohen’s investigation into Trump, the Times wrote.\n— In 2012, two truckers were killed as they reportedly hauled out a shipment of coal for Trump, the mayor of Cincinnati offered to help the family pay the fine, and at least a dozen other people were injured in a shooting outside the hotel in Atlantic City.\nThe perpetrators, Christopher Norby, 26, and his brother Darrin Wiske, 23, were shot dead while driving the truck.\n']"

916,Bill Nye: Science made America great,"['Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson on a CNN appearance today made the case for the science that has had the greatest impact on human lives and the lives of millions since Apollo 11 in 1969.\nScience, far from being a trivial exercise, has opened us up to world discoveries that we haven’t seen before. So, here’s Tyson’s call for conservation, exploitation and extinction from both himself and yours truly.\nThe ultimate goal should be destroying the last ten years of mankind’s reign of terror and eradicating the one tangible molecule of life that we owe to the human race.\nI want to know about that the first part. People love to make judgments on what to say about what to do. Some come from science and some are from the cult-like base, or whatever their reason for feeling left out would be.\nMy motivation is to learn better and to tell and believe that what happens in the world matters a lot to humans. This is some of the most interesting out there (the Science Department has a PhD in Biology) and I’m not only there, but looking for something to learn and believe in. It’s possible for knowledge to be sold and in search of knowledge you’re likely sold more and less. My goal is to inspire people to give up the habit of fiddling with projects or people who want to further understand the world.\nThe people I’m looking for to study the science are doing it—they’re all masters of it. They tell their stories, they tell the stories; they tell the stories. Their brains are wired to keep more and more of the information flowing, through the eyes of the beholder. As we age, our brains and bodies absorb more information, we need to learn more and we need to learn to keep track of it.\nThere’s a word for all of this: Gizmodo.\nSo, are you ready to embrace any of the essential information? I believe there is much to learn from each event that makes us world-famous.\nIf you want to understand the science in a critical way in the midst of vast change, you can do so here at CNN. I believe that the most important thing to learn about the world and what you’re doing is science at its best.\nToday’s CNN appearance with Science Director Michael O’Hanlon really means something to me. He addresses the urgent need for us to protect the future. Our souls are not there to teach science. The world is not about making us know what it really takes to make a life easier. It’s about making us aware of it.\nAccording to the American Enterprise Institute, scientists are dying, dying to discover, dying to tell. I believe that what we have right now—our precious knowledge of how the human race gets created—creates both problems and opportunities.\nAnyone looking for better ways to understand life is doomed. The science does nothing to promote conservation, exploitation, or extinction. It merely helps promote our perils—be it in a place of abundance, or in a place of suffering. But it’s always best that something might be better than no science.\nScience is not just a science. There are no shortcuts when it comes to knowledge. The life course is what has been handed down. There are no shortcuts.\nIt’s time to give it to the people who can help ensure that it happens, not to the people who can facilitate the science it does.\nFor the love of science, we are more than one country.\nFathaf Simmons is the executive director of Yes We Can!

Sarah Palin and many others for their memories of veterans and explaining the nature of their stories, how important they are, what made them different and some of the best achievements they have had.\nTakei had said before the Congress’s 2013 Veteran’s Day Jobs and Veterans Day last November that despite all of the news about the sagging economy and deep cuts in military spending, veterans do not play any part in that.\n“The reality is there are still close to 200,000 Americans on this payroll,” Takei said, “a number that the government does not tell the news.”\n“But someone’s being killed in action and they are in some way their personal political voice amplifying the voices of the soldiers so that some warriors have not at all seen or heard them and they want to hear them,” he continued.\nThe Veterans and Military Appreciation Month kicks off this weekend with Veterans Day ceremonies. President Obama will honor many of the last tributes with “It’s a Wonderful Life,” while Republicans will honor veterans who came before them. On Saturday, meanwhile, some supporters of the President’s dedicated soldier project will take the stage to give a live music performance, specifically in honour of those who fought and died in the fight for our freedom and served our country.\nTakei’s remarks encapsulate his feelings as he said: “By coming out, I can learn from my experience and some of the stories I’ve heard. I can heal what I was a part of and I can overcome what I thought I was all too familiar with.”\nTakei said “there were things the president encouraged me to stay away from,” like improving military mobility, building more broadband networks and talking about having a healthier workforce. The best way to right this wrong has been to empower veterans to help change their futures, he said.\n“The America I know is changing with me,” he said. “If you give back. If you lift up the American flag, if you dream, if you walk the red lines, if you play political games, if you work hard, if you’re with your buddies, if you think outside the box, that’s what’s most important.”\nTakei added that “maybe the best way we can treat some of the service members that come before us and fight for us” is to enable them to talk to people they would otherwise hear and their stories will make them stronger, unlike the ones they did as soldiers.\n']"
918,David Axelrod: I woke up this morning as an alternative fact,"['WASHINGTON (CNN) — Returning to CNN’s “Early Show” after three months of teasing his earlier promise to “get CNN out of Iraq,” outgoing CNN White House strategist David Axelrod reached out for his morning drive show on Sunday.\n“Late at night, my parents woke me up this morning to find that they don’t get out of Iraq,” Axelrod told CNN’s Chris Cuomo. “Is that a plausible retraction? What about the United States being in Iraq as the solution to the problem? Do we want the United States in charge of Iraq? If we do, could the United States remain a single-entity government?”\nAxelrod’s new book, “We Need More in Humiliation,” is out Friday and features excerpts from his initial impression of the two-plus-hour television interview, and from highlights of his White House press briefings and briefings on Fox News’ Fox Report with Bret Baier.\n“This is great,” Cuomo told the veteran White House strategist Sunday. “But I mean, even since he made his announcement. I was surprised I couldn’t hear all his remarks and statements throughout the day.”\nIf his characterization sounds familiar, it’s because Chris Cuomo is also one of Axelrod’s managers at CNN. The two worked together for years on issues including the Iraq War, gender equality and the war on ISIS.\nAxelrod traveled to Bosnia and written a column for the Omaha Beach Post as an MSNBC contributor and President Barack Obama became the administration’s second-ranking official in an American foreign policy position.\n“I thought he would have been refreshing in those days,” Cuomo said of the former White House strategist. “But instead, his character has taken on a lesser degree because of his personality and charisma.”\nAxelrod has remained fresh in the Trump administration ever since Jeff Sessions was fired by Trump.\nBut Trump’s reassertions to the White House have prompted questions about whether he has a longer timetable for exiting the White House.\nAxelrod said in the ABC News interview that he takes in “comfort” in his ability to work on behalf of a state of emergency in the Middle East as long as Trump can stay in office. He said former President Barack Obama gave him the field to quit on the nation’s borders and move on with the presidency.\n“His general approval has been great,” Axelrod said of Trump. “You understand why his approval ratings are so high for him. Because he is a judge of character. His popularity goes up. People in these communities still listen to him.”\n']"
919,The Donald Trump presidency: How the world sees it,"['A U.S. presidential elections as a whole is unprecedented, yet the nature of the debate across the globe is kind of the opposite. There is a difference between the expectations set by those looking at the election results, and what these people are actually hearing, and what they are hearing. The controversy that has erupted is most emblematic of that: the Trump presidency. Who did it? How was it used?\nIt all starts with the election. Trump’s narrative, which has been noticeably inconsistent, has fueled calls for change, and powerful factions around the world have stepped up to put forward a vision of America that needs to be lived in, where the American dream is truly alive. They’ve called for economic growth and ""democracy"" inside the gates of Washington. The theme of American exceptionalism has been played out in the U.S. election games.\nSome of the global politics of the campaign seems to have raised almost a class divide. For global progressives, what struck me most was not how the candidate positions were presented, but how the players tended to be. If you take the traditional dimensions of the campaign and look at electoral choice from the white-collar perspective, most people are open to debating what it means to be America.\nFor almost 30 years, the highest-profile candidates’ speeches centered around fact-checking — that is, watching the standard formality of the candidates’ speeches for the entire body of argument. The resulting debate has been peppered with misleading statements and mischaracterizations, while the candidates have suffered no real obstacles.\nWithout a doubt, the fiery rhetoric of the contest still plays a role here, though it’s hard to argue with the fact that many of the campaign issues are as much about the value of the election as about this moment.\nSo how is America different from how it was before the 2016 election?\nThe story of the campaign is a different set of dynamics.\nHillary Clinton’s rise from a privileged teenager who feared losing so much after deciding her father left to work for a government-owned oil company, to the biggest party in the country has opened the doors of a world seen by many as different. The key competition has emerged inside the traditional political arguments: the idea that victory is not about wealth, but about policy achievement.\nNewsworthy and absurd, Hillary Clinton as a candidate made the calls for drastic cuts to Medicare — the cornerstone of her presidency — and the national debt. She championed the health-care reforms the ACA also passed, and critics contended that she steered a legislative agenda that mostly targeted small businesses.\nIt’s nothing new for this country. For the first time in decades, all of us, including the Obama administration, have been part of a political contest devoted to limited policies, which in essence is about policy attainment.\n']"
920,David Axelrod: Obama's legacy can't be erased,"['Washington - Words that word - they say those words. Words that suddenly boom that they again say that they are fond memories of those words. Words that suddenly make them that special and humble. Words that have immortal meaning. Words that develop possibilities for a people to become stronger and free. Words that have meaning not bestowed on only those who listen them. Words that have an abiding influence on an ordinary person. Words that carry meaning in the heart of a leader. Words that encourage others to innovate and change. Words that remind us that \'good\' is possible. Words that remind us that \'bad\' is getting worse. Words that produce consequences so strong that we no longer can fight for it. Words that convince us that no matter what we try to do, life requires compromise. Words that make us willing to compromise. Words that encourage - urge us to, when we need it - do it. Words that encourage and prepare us for success. Words that point us to change or create change. Words that help us to be truly our best selves. Words that remind us of the future, and how important our decisions and actions will be. Words that remind us of the importance of our eternal love and gratitude for the creator. Words that teach us to be better than we are and where all of us fall short. Words that remind us that there is always more to the world than meets the eye and does not give us the all of the answers, but does help us identify our hope and need, find a way to reach our full potential, and make that world and life better together.\nOn a different note, Barack Obama is being discussed quite a bit in the news media this week, and we want to make sure that we are all reminded of the faces that Barack Obama\'s contemporaries and early students endured as they advanced through the ""Techkicks"" of the world, and other post-World War II blazes. Two examples of the President\'s grace in this regard are those who speak with total eloquence, humble demeanor, and resilience. Barack Obama is trying to be seen as someone who has inspired people; a leader who goes out of his way to give back, in the same way that he does with his historic friends in the city of Chicago - Joe Biden, Governor Sarah Palin, and his former Navy SEAL son, Navy SEAL Ryan Lewis - President Obama\'s legacy can\'t be erased - unless it can be damaged by politics. This is a mistake, Obama\'s legacy cannot be undoed. It is our duty to not only honor and protect the President who embraces his legacy, but to also honor those who were elected to the office - who have sacrificed for him.\nNone of us can, however, get away with urging our best selves to join with the President on the need to transform the world so that a better world is better for us, as opposed to being engaged only in futile sniping and combatting against what we try to do. We need a President who will help us overcome challenges; who will recognize that the country can be ""slaughtered"" so long as we make smart choices, and who shares our promise to each and every one of us. We need a President who will work with the President to reduce the costs of healthcare and the repeal of so many of the crazy regulations that we have inherited. We need a President who will talk to the President about the critical unmet need in health care, and who will assess whether it makes sense for us to have a chronic disease that now threatens our health and the ability to move on to the next level. We need a President who has a focus on making our next great American brighter.\n']"

922,20 top takes on 2016,"['The year of 2016 is spent on anticipation and fear — and justifiably so — and this year, as things get a little bit more open and personal, the challenge of getting through all of the stuff we wouldn’t look at as serious by now remains unanswered.\nThis week’s panel are:\n– What do 2015 and 2016 have in common?\n– Is it time to pivot to the future, or stop?\n– What’s the state of Republican response to Donald Trump?\n– Is there no sign that a few months back, we can start voting?\n– What’s the trade narrative for the 2016 midterms?\n– Who are the House Republicans who are looking to drain the next American economy?\n– Is the GOP satisfied with their track record?\n– Is the GOP worried about voter disengagement?\n– What’s the fight about with illegal immigration?\n– Who are the two hopes for the GOP’s presidential campaigns?\n“The arts of optimistic optimism” — and all things hope — are the operative words of I.Q. rapper Eden Crystal. For the content of this blog, here are 20 of my top takeaways from 2016.\n1. Don’t try to predict everything, but ask yourselves: what are the odds of you being voted to the left or right by 2016?\n2. The two dominant Republican candidates, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, are having it very, very hard this election cycle. They are both making us nervous.\n3. Presidential hopefuls have failed to deliver the kind of impressive turnouts that usually propel presidential hopes up. If we consider 2016’s really good returns, it will not be long before 2016’s failures become systemic.\n4. It’s too easy to look past the events of 2016, especially the myriad of negative events in the intervening week. Start the process now, don’t you?\n5. 2015 was a leap year for tech startups. When they were in demand, things went extremely well. For millennials, the tech boom pushed the media market to new highs as they saw in the need for digital platforms. For Wall Street, the tech boom accounted for real growth. Corporate earnings rose a record. It was the third-largest GDP increase of all time. It wasn’t quite as big of a leap year as 2016, but it still reflected what was happening. And more and more Americans have graduated from college and have a way of saving their own money, which is now bad news for the country.\n6. There is little we can do to stop Trump’s nomination nomination. This year’s incumbents are among the oldest people in history who wouldn’t be left out in the cold. The party believes in the Millennial Generation, and I think voters want it that way, too.\n7. As people around the world brace for immigration policy changes, life shouldn’t get any easier for would-be newcomers. For many Americans, 2018 should be the year they decide their country is theirs.\n8. Trump has given Republicans cause for hope with the fury that unleashed the GOP establishment in 2014, as it became a pack of bad-government appointees and individuals. However, the other side of this coin appears to be bored and desperate. What will Republicans do this year?\n9. Trump’s administration is full of threats against us with all these promise to get and do to rebuild our infrastructure, but is the end of his administration exactly in order? What’s the threat level for our airspace, CIA or state of the art airports?\n10. While Democrats and Republicans are finding ways to get outside the mainstream, mostly by building their base on the wrong issues, the divisions within a party seem overwhelming. Which is why 2018 shouldn’t be the year Democrats hope it is.\n11. Take longer than what’s already been, as Republican enthusiasm isn’t sitting so well. Addressing the aisle and filling the subway, all the while offering them platforms for political compromise, is a bit too much to expect. The questions about why are we proceeding to Trump’s denunciations and questioning him as “lazy” and “lazy” make their most compelling political difference.\n12. New enterprises will bubble up to house my young adult children at a younger age. It will be great for my kids to be better actors (in practical practical terms) than show how I make sense of their situation.\n13. I worry we might have too much of this week, but we’ll pick up here if all of the rumor-basis trauma fades away.']"
923,"The long, strange trip to the 2016 election: a cartoon view","['The report ranks president to Americans as having the most overall success rates, with Barack Obama clocking in with less positive, measured wins in 2016 than in his eight years in office. Obama\'s general finding that people are unhappy with the country is also lower than have anyone ever recorded for 40 years – the number of Americans in the 18 month period.\nOn CNN\'s new “Meet the Press,” CNN political analyst Wendell Pope reinforced that view, pointing out how President Donald Trump has done far worse in comparison to his predecessor than Obama did last year.\n“It’s the best he’s done in 16 years. The other presidents did not have to acknowledge that. It’s very rare. The Democratic nominees didn’t acknowledge that,” Pope said, ""but I always say, in an old echo we used to talk about presidents, Trump first gets the job for a bit. ... The fact that Republicans don’t acknowledge that they actually went after our president, saying we are going after his presidency, does make Trump look worse than he actually does.”\nHe added: “The national psychologists don’t allow that to happen. In many cases, when they happen, it is because the president himself is not able to bring it forward because people are doing their best to report it to Congress. That doesn’t make sense.”\nPope explained the myriad problem experienced by political leaders when they oversee officials on foreign leaders, ""Because of the climate you have a president in place and it’s unclear whether he’s going to deliver it. I think we’re doing that, and it is incredibly frustrating and this is unacceptable.”\nThose who are aware of what the current situation brings and deserve a strong education on what really goes wrong on foreign policy can complete this task. But Pope asked: “Is Obama a sound President? If you actually thought about it, at least he was not terrible in the first place.”\nThe next iteration of the White House must be better at the realm of ideas, considered top priorities, to get things moving. It needs to articulate its own ideas at the national level.\nPope\'s poll wasn\'t taken immediately or until a couple days before the elections.\nPope\'s latest poll averages that rate 60% positive responses from people. He suggests polling numbers in the 70s could be an accurate measurement of what to expect the next nine months.\n']"

In the film, Petrino has football problems with his family, as well as drinking problems and a few shoddy coaching decisions.\nThanks to the blanks Brown has been making to help support his production company, Bailey\'s Productions, the film is drawing millions of dollars worth of publicity as well as millions of bookings.\n""Bobby could have said, \'Is this ready to take him?

927,Could Zika be the next HIV?,"['(CNN) — Yes, Zika may already be a phenomenon affecting the brains of Americans.\nThe little known virus causes microcephaly, a marked increase in severe developmental delay caused by the loss of an infant’s hemisphere.\nBut in 18 to 25 months, Zika may now affect at least a few new children and adults, just as can scientists’ predictions of the course of viral illness for others.\nHow much time can it take?\nYou can’t forecast the amount of time a mosquito bites a baby’s brain. Zika virus has only been found in some regions of Central and South America.\nScientists are now saying its limited exposure in humans, its only known severe form, may be enough to worsen the condition.\nThe mosquito that can transmit Zika has been shown to be able to put on a man’s protective coat in times of extreme threat, and even after the moment it’s bitten has a repeat of risk.\nIn another recent study, new research of high school students, who were part of a random sampling of 50,000 children, showed that the risk of Zika-associated symptoms was lowered considerably by the researchers using a mosquito repellent.\n“There’s nothing that is going to precipitate the timing of symptoms,” says Dr. Albert Moura, a researcher at CDC and senior author of the study and a professor of epidemiology at Penn State.\nIf all of these findings are accepted as a likely explanation for Zika, the transmission risk would probably go higher than even a mosquito would be doing, the study authors say.\nThis delay can also lead to variations in the first-trimester sexual performance of those infected with the virus.\n“If you did reproduce even in the presence of Zika, you could have seasonal damage,” Moura said. “Could you kind of make sexual fidelity better if they transmitted Zika?”\nStill, Zika can be the biggest killer of young people born with the condition — the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention projects the risk at 3.3 million Americans this year.\nThe original Zika virus was first identified in 1976. Then, the spread expanded to include possibly serious head trauma caused by infectious diseases.\nScientists on either side of the issue have struggled to determine the true extent of the virus and the impact on potential victims of the neurological neurological disorder.\nTesting for Zika virus might be another little magic trick, says Dr. Robert Baumgardner, a consultant to the International Institute for Tropical Medicine and Research.\n“In the end it’s much more difficult to know the susceptibility of a mosquito relative to how severe the virus is, because some infections can occur at different points in life,” Baumgardner said.\nSome experts think Zika could cause viral problems similar to one that so common in African countries — the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n“We know that males and females carry the virus, and quite frequently they go through an infection before they get their antibodies,” Baumgardner said.\n“But this could be another reaction to the viruses that infect women, because — you know what? They’re so active at the same time that they’re migrating from one sex to another,” he said.\n“The infection tends to develop around this disease, which makes women more susceptible,” he added.\n']"
928,The real terror threat in America is homegrown,"['Our government has been in denial about our criminal activities, and our president has not questioned that.\nIt turns out that our history is pretty grim: there have been nine months in which 10 people have committed heinous, nefarious acts of violence, and seven of them as we speak.\nBelow are some famous examples of those acts of violence, according to CNN.\nDeath to a Bill Clinton\nJuly 21, 1996: After a State Department meeting, President Clinton appointed former acting secretary of state George Shultz to national security and counterterrorism matters. After an act of violence or death by other means, Shultz ordered a weapons program to increase the ability of the UN to combat terrorism. Two years later, Clinton made the same change, ordering additional arsenals of military, financial, and diplomatic items.\nLeaving Clinton to Head the Economic Commission on Terrorism\nJuly 6, 1995: The Attorney General said Hillary Clinton’s team had failed to produce a high level report that implicated “low-level officials in the Justice Department, the FBI, and USAID."" Clinton continued to announce the invasion of Afghanistan and the occupation of Iraq, and repeatedly put U.S. interests above the national interest. Soon after releasing a monthly press report, Secretary of State Joe Biden criticized an investigative report in the Washington Post, which had recently been reissued. The investigation was hinged upon major revelations about CIA and Department of Defense surveillance programs. And so it became a reality: Not just anything was off limits, but sometimes relatively, at any time.\nHousing shortages result in mass die-offs\nOct. 15, 2006: After providing housing for American citizens in Arab countries, former Secretary of State George Shultz sent soldiers to Yemen. A pill mill employee had told the Department of Defense that to send about 5,000 soldiers to northern Iraq, there were more houses to be filled. Several people were killed in the response, and the public continues to criticize the military operation.\nArmy Death by Terrorism\nApr. 22, 1993: Attorney General Hillary Clinton appointed former acting Secretary of State George Shultz to national security and counterterrorism matters. Shultz\'s office became embroiled in an investigation into whether Shultz’s agency had used arms to support terrorist groups. Their investigation led to a federal jury ordering the government to pay $1.2 million to a woman who claimed to have been the victim of a bomb attack. Shultz fought the FBI in the review, and did not apologize for the investigation.\nWorld War II-era alliances are destroyed\nOct. 31, 1945: After the end of World War II, the United States provided military and financial support to the Franco-American alliance, a major element of the $13 trillion-plus economic transfer of Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East to the American military forces. Nine years later, U.S. forces invaded Afghanistan, and the Allies died from the resulting war.\nIn part, this is because the program for maintaining the war effort was integrated into the Anglo-American alliance, by the Allies\' own admission and in part because the later bombing campaigns of the Axis powers spawned other variants. This is particularly at odds with Bill Clinton\'s official view that international forces had nothing to do with the war effort.\nAmericans deserve better than these random acts of violence. If we thought these horrible acts -- terrorists, sex abusers, rapists, pot smokers -- were somehow state-sponsored, then we would be far more concerned with protecting the American people than terrorist activities. Americans deserve better than these random acts of violence. We would be far more concerned with protecting our citizens than terrorists. What we are now prepared to do is help determine if they are real and run.\n']"
929,Your son needs to read Stanford rape victim's letter,"[""Writing to a girl about the student’s choice to remain anonymous, after her comments at a Stanford sexual assault scandal, will make you empathize with a young woman’s life and her feelings.\nBut it won’t help you emotionally focus on the campus offense.\nContinue reading on CNN.\nThe idea behind the letter is to focus on the victim’s experience. It’s kind of a “Carrie” in this case.\n“He needed to write it. It’s so that you can say, ‘I was there at that level, you know? There are so many people who have done this to me and those very young women,’” mother Laura told CNN .\nMaybe after writing to the victim, she can go back and talk to her.\nFacebook page sets up in case fallout reports emerge\nFacebook had no comment on the letter as a “social media strategy” according to the site.\n“We’ve often taken a cautious approach to these types of PR messages,” said Jeff Coletta, spokesman for Facebook. “This is not like responding to a mob attack where you still can’t be sure who attacked you.”\nOther websites have also been hit for breaking big stories or threatening online hate speech.\nPeople are outraged\nYet some people seem surprised that strangers would try to harm their sexual assault victim or even write letters. Some of the harsher ways are that real pain is they felt when they met her and they forgive themselves.\nFacebook reported that a woman in Stanford called 541 times after writing to express anger and terror about the assault. She also wrote a poem, a composite of six or seven images in graphic detail.\n“I held my breath until you told me, ‘See, I have no choice but to write,'” she wrote.\nOnline forums have been created as replies to contact letters like the woman’s. So the first (or perhaps most likely, the final) response is: “Hey Mom, I hope you have the strength to be able to forgive yourself and get it all back.”\n“That’s great,” adds another: “Let me know if you do this right away and if we truly have someone close you can trust.”\n""]"
930,'We need a restroom revolution',"['By Matt Michels and Robert Cyran\n“For decades, Americans over 91 years have defied the advances in technology and established their own toilets and health care.”\nThat’s the way the organizers of the 2008 Fight for the Future coalition, Fred Nadler of Samsara in the Dominican Republic and Patrick Benson, Dapenga, Thomas S. Wszold of Alguess in Colorado, treat the issue of the restroom.\nThose arguments against gender-reversing restroom rules remain valid. Over 9,000 countries have tried similar rules since 1980, but critics say the goal is to replace humans with robots in response to the image of a man in a giant strip of paper.\nThey do it the wrong way. On Tuesday, Nadler, Benson and the other activists decided to take the argument to Seattle, where they’ll stage a shuttle run during a mega-day of citizen action on the issue.\n“It’s pretty clear what this is about: restoration of our historical toilet system,” Nadler said. “Let’s make it happen. We need to make toilets obsolete.”\nNadler said his group and its allies aim to derail the move to a new universal restroom law. They’re organizing a “die in” march on Washington in May.\n']"
931,Rob Ford died of his more acceptable disease,"['By CNN\n(CNN) — The Toronto mayoral campaign of Mayor Rob Ford has suffered a public disaster. He died of cancer a few days after announcing his announcement that he would be stepping down from his mayoralty.\nMore than two decades after a crime spree that went unsolved for almost 40 years, there were no fresh clues in the 14,000-word announcement: “I want to ask Rob Ford to retire.”\nFord’s ""vital leadership skills have made him a successful manager of the city he loves.”\nHis murder-plagued narrative of “acts of vandalism” — rampant abuses, untrue stories about the “hounded malevolence” of official incompetence — became familiar to the office of the mayor of Toronto, adding fuel to the fire of outrage.\nThe seven counts, which the Ontario Superior Court actually ended on February 2, were stacked onto Ford’s construction business. Also, the four counts he filed in November were publicized in newspapers across Canada and even made an appearance in a YouTube video: “Rob Ford should retire in good conscience.”\nFord’s epic, on-again, off-again, indiscretions revolved around his alleged habit of murdering and maiming people with his infamously gutter-throwing, chin-thumping, finger-pointing and cold-blooded knife-fighting.\nHe was pilloried for abusing government workers, perhaps so aggressively as to steal from their jobs. Others hated him for his indiscretions, and understandably.\nBut then reality hit Toronto in November.\nFord’s alleged crime spree predated his ouster in 1998 from office, when he and his then-wife Doria announced he was resigning from office.\nFord had spent many of his free time poring over the available evidence to try to force a possible indictment or indictment by common criminal courts — just a slush fund — before succumbing to a relentless onslaught of attention.\nBut then he suddenly accepted an invitation from a friend to “prove” his innocence. In the process, Ford began to shake off his taint of late-night crime and politics.\nNow, it is entirely possible that next week’s vote against him will be hard-won, if only because politics is so subjective.\nBecause now, in this election cycle, many people, both inside and outside the city, will wonder about Ford’s motives.\nAnd, perhaps more crucially, if his dismissal doesn’t prove that he got off on one of the most questionable stories in recent years, then you know he won’t be the next Toronto mayor, either.\nFord himself has said, “I think I deserve to be and I’m not willing to just rubber-stamp.”\nWill this result in the horrific death of his real or bogus crime?\nAfter all, Ford’s best efforts before, during and after the November election trail failed to dispel public outrage that the government had ignored and conspired to cover up Ford’s real crime and criminal activity.\nWith the specter of another crime ring looming, it is perhaps appropriate for Ford to talk about his resignations and the virtues he espoused.\nJust last week, a longtime board member of the Ford family held a bizarre news conference in which he demanded that his estranged wife pledge the taxpayer her loyalty to him.\n“I’m not going to see Bob Ford going on to serve my family, even if it means that one day I want to believe that Bob Ford is gone,” said Kathryn MacKenzie.\nShe said she, her son and Judy were being punished for taking the jobs at Ford’s construction company. “Bob Ford hasn’t moved on.”\nAnd MacKenzie expressed sympathy for the family, which has been working with a police investigation into the death of their son more than a decade ago, and the family’s desire to prevent this continuing wrongdoing.\nFord went so far as to suggest that “its mother was trying to bribe me so I wouldn’t have to do it.”\nThere is an implicit acknowledgement of that that Ford’s posturing is now fully justified.\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of CNN.\n']"
932,The four big questions about Donald Trump (Opinion),"['(CNN) — Take a look below.\n1. Who’s got the most junior in the universe?\nThat can be a tough answer. Dez Bryant with 19 catches — including 3 touchdowns — dwarfs Dole Ward. Marvin Harrison at 15 catches — with 457 yards and 10 touchdowns — is a little more impressive. Jared Goff had 50 and Elijah Thomas 40, respectively. Someone has to do some serious touring of the NFL’s Mountain West teams.\n2. What is the decline of Donald Trump?\nThe most popular president in the land, just two weeks ago, he was trounced by the likes of Josh Norman and Josh Allen, while Jared Goff was better (most of the season). Perhaps his education with the Republican/establishment and respect from the press is paying off.\n3. Who are the most impressive in the world?\nThe San Francisco 49ers did it again in the Super Bowl win against the Seattle Seahawks. The Broncos’ Rashaad Penny was the quarterback and Felix Hernandez, who had two home runs, was the game-winner. Jordan Payton was the tackle and Ian Williams had the touch. The Roethlisberger wasn’t ready to be the NFL’s first Hall of Famer. He was 20 of 29 for 244 yards and two interceptions in the win over the Patriots. Manuel passed for 406 yards and a touchdown in Sunday’s victory over the Patriots and did a lot better with 42.8 yards per catch.\n4. What do you make of Trump?\nTrump has muddled past controversial speeches and with his communications teams, has made some controversial statements. He has lied about dropping out of the 2016 presidential race, having some truly bonkers substance, publicly stated some crazy things and has kept Trump out of sight, both because of his celebrity and because of his efforts to weaken the Republican party. A look into his past and what’s ahead is the most significant question of all.\n']"

934,Donald Trump's Super Tuesday amnesia on race,"['ORLANDO, Fla. - It\'s been an exhausting campaign. Barack Obama returned to the White House to regain the Oval Office, and Donald Trump has handed it back to Hillary Clinton. But, as far as presidential elections go, none have gone as smoothly as the three most consequential one in modern U.S. history, the last -- April 19, 1996.\nA horrible president who lacks the humanity and compassion to confront the terrible humanitarian crisis that is the Connecticut River.\nU.S. Army President J.D. Power initiated his televised call for overseas victims of terrorist attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan at the United Nations in Geneva on Feb. 6, 1996.\nHe then proceeded to register one campaign that March that year, the appearance of George Orwell\'s 1984, in his home newspaper and introducing himself to listeners during TV\'s annual ""Peoples Choice"" protest, and to his own campaign in 2000 -- even if he didn\'t get over some basic breaks that day.\nIn that time frame, we can see how irresponsible American election officials are. ""In a President Clinton\'s time, America was suffering something unimaginable and unimaginable,"" Trump said.\nHe walked through the House Chamber in Norfolk, Va., calling the Hartford, Conn.-born critic of Republicans ""ignorant"" and ""outright dishonest,"" while describing himself as looking for salvation in the Republican party.\nInstead, the campaign he blamed for the terrorist attacks was the campaign of Hillary Clinton and her allies in the Republican Party. Not your typical politician.\nHere reporters added to his credibility, and his statements about ""phony"" intelligence and the Syrian government\'s support for terrorism, which Trump tweeted but didn\'t reveal, were deleted from the president\'s official website.\nYears of personal failures\nTheir failure did not sit well with most ordinary Americans, especially those who spoke out, many of whom we\'re sharing this story with:\n* Clinton\'s campaign called the 2004 presidential vote an ""information tsunami."" And most ordinary Americans did not tune in to MSNBC, CNBC, CNN, or Fox News.\n* Clinton campaigned in western Virginia before heading to Virginia, signing up with the campaign and entering the George W. Bush House.\n* The election turned in New Hampshire, where Clinton was pummeled by the cancer that was cancer, and Obama won it in Wisconsin. And there, the debate had turned to Ralph Nader in South Carolina and then Hillary Clinton in Vermont.\n* He returned to NYC for a series of rallies.\n* A former presidential candidate noted that a court ruled that he had exhausted his appeals.\n* The office of the presidency declared more than $2 million in illegal donations to his campaign, following an extensive review of the many business ties he had cultivated.\n* Clinton pledged to work with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Clintons, and to elect the first female president.\n* Clinton backed the 2007 Democratic National Convention in Boston. The convention had spawned a fiercely anti-free trade ""fascist takeover"" of the Democratic Party, according to the New York Times, headlined ""Two Leaders Rored.""\n* The first lady acknowledged ""a sense of shame"" after she spoke at the DNC in support of candidates with deep ties to the NRA and banks and who ""liked deregulation.""\nThis year, 2016, we are going to see what the American presidential election is all about -- now about the economy, about the future of our children, the future of America -- and on both coasts and in the name of peace.\nCitizen\'s voice at work\nIn his first speech as president on April 19, 1994, Obama called for ""an amazing event"" on the ground in the U.S. but so far, what a lot of Americans have not understood is that what he meant was that a lot of Americans, including me, had lost hope that he could even be president.\n(Rita Roxbury at the Tulsa World)\n']"
935,Donald Trump brings out the worst in people,"['In between posing for cute selfies with pouting lawmakers and earning the ire of the nation\'s leaders, Donald Trump put together a confusing and self-deprecating display of sarcasm that went back and forth a bit.\nSo much so that Michael Flynn, Flynn\'s former White House chief of staff, was revealed Thursday as a whistle-blower in an NBC News-Wall Street Journal story that\'s led to conversations Trump was with Russian officials and Wikileaks.\nThe leak broke a story Wednesday about President Barack Obama\'s approach to dealing with Russia, sparking questions about whether the president can rely on aggressive Russian tactics in the years ahead.\nSuch topics as Flynn\'s arrest and detention of pro-Russia activists such as Sergei Skripal, were on President Trump\'s agenda at the March 30-31 news conference in North Dakota.\n""The worst thing is Donald Trump, this administration, with all the new anxiety about me, with the Russians,"" said U.S. Sen.

936,Do we need more fake holidays? (Opinion),"['By Toby Davis\nThe New York Times asks some depressing questions in its latest edition, “Moms Who Decide: The Limits of No Holiday,” this week. Perhaps the most depressing questions are: Why are we willing to test a piece of paper with a photo of our kids in the middle, on the side of the road, in front of our house? And why are we willing to preserve or stick together a piece of paper that can be a clue about who we are, but that can\'t provide something meaningful? These questions—fasinatey, meaning, is that a good place to begin?—can be answered by a simple interpretation: that happiness comes first, and then happiness will come first.\nYou can\'t know how life works in the world until it\'s lived, and a new book, Live Without Real Happiness: The Reactions of 5 Million Low-Level Careerists and the Everyday People who May be Taking Stock With Their Dream (Al Michaels Books, October 25), explains that happiness is what you live with (and why many of them are incredibly lucky), and happiness is what you see everywhere you look.\nThis is why ""Life can be too precious for too many people, for too many reasons,"" writes Emma Davis, in her book titled ""The Happiness Paradox.""\nIt\'s possible for people to earn more money, spend less on medical care, or buy things around the house in order to rise above any mental ailments they might have. It\'s also possible for them to live tolerably, in spite of these spats. And it\'s possible for them to be motivated to care for people they have no connection to. Here, however, is where we\'re starting to come closer to our real identity: we live only after people have committed themselves to a shared cause, shared by their feelings of unhappiness. This is what happens when you give in to others to share a task with.\n“In this unfinished scheme of time, what you do matters. You stand out from all others on the world, and you have the power to change things,” says Peggy McKeown in the book. “It is what brings us together.”\nBecause of this reciprocal relationship, it may not be to thank people for helping us achieve something beyond ourselves. But it may be to look at people, knowing that they care, to look at us and decide that we belong to a group that is a worthy cause, and to see if there is something worth doing.\n“I envy our neighbors, and the experiences of other people, for breaking down barriers in order to build something new. For one thing, they need our help: our loyalty and solidarity and support. We are the first line of defense, protection, and support. This is something that is usually too easily overlooked: valuing others. It seems ludicrous that there are always others acting like the evils of greed and selfishness – who know that the only way we may have saved our own lives is to have made do with us. And it is not impossible. We may, however, choose to actively conceal that choice.”\nWhat to think of people who are making the goal of fulfilling their dreams beyond themselves?\nStay tuned, too. We\'ve all had to struggle in the past decade to find the right answer. Isn\'t that what other people do?\n']"
937,Is the First Amendment safe from Donald Trump?,"['By Andrew Cohen\nWarroom, CNN\nRemember when the president had to defend himself?\nTrump appeared to call out Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly for her ""very, very smart"" Sunday. His intervention made a sure splash, potentially damaging to his presidency.\nNow, Twitter and the mainstream media have nearly unanimously figured that what Trump said last night was harmful. And while the argument itself is stirring, here’s the thing: If there’s nothing more dangerous and shameful about Trump in the American mind than clowning around with his mouth hanging off its, it’s wholly justified.\nBut what is most disturbing is that some are so sure that the right thing is no more and that what Trump said was sad, and is therefore certainly not constitutional.\nIf this were all the Trump presidency, we wouldn’t have every single major issue on the ballot. Maybe only about nine, not the fifteen of Trump’s teleprompters, but certainly more than 100. And, remember, he’s in a 2016 election, and many voters are disgusted.\n""We have real threats, and we\'ve taken them,"" according to John Bolton, the former national security adviser, according to The New York Times, a moving account of how Trump demonized two mosques and even murdered a young black man.\nVoters are disgusted by Donald Trump. Maybe more so than you should tell them.\nI will disagree. After all, Trump did nothing wrong, and pretty much every other president in American history tried to do something about it, and Republicans everywhere did, so why shouldn’t anyone else?\nRemember, Trump hasn’t already been called a clown. He’s out there kicking ass on one side, acting as if he’s not that serious, or whiny, or unthinking, or strange, or insufferable.\nCome on. You’re so good. . . . you don’t know that you’re bad or stupid.\nOr that you’re sick of hearing Trump’s nonsense because, well, he’s so good.\nIt will be even worse with all the noise this week.\n']"
938,Which generation has it worse? (Opinion),"['I\'m on the cover of that ""A Seat at the Table"" -- a young think tank called the National Interest. It\'s got a ton of money, a folksy bit of heart and a lot of people really cranky. But, I want to break down why I\'m here.\nThe issue is that there are so many different types of people, too, whether it\'s millennials (remember me?) or even average people who are less financially stable than I am (though I have a square peg in a round hole). I can\'t think of a single generation where there was not a generation gap when it comes to the habits they learned in the 1980s.\nThis is the same reason I want young people to be remembered, not their parents, if they\'re already here.\nOne of the biggest problems my generation has is that when you look at my generation, they are incredibly irresponsible. The reason we are so irresponsible is because we don\'t recognize the consequences, so that makes it hard for us to handle ourselves. For someone that is as healthy as my generation is, and usually I\'m pretty healthy but a number of people don\'t look healthy at all.\nSo, it\'s not only me that\'s leading the charge. There are so many examples of younger people being irresponsible because they\'ve just fallen in love with too many extreme things and they don\'t feel guilt at their end of the decision. We\'re not terrible people and we all have mistakes. But, we are lazy and judgmental.\nYou see, most kids don\'t even bother to understand what they\'re trying to do. If they were smarter, they might think of the issues as simple, or solutions instead of elaborate fiction.\nI always say I believe in investments and investing because doing that is the only way that you can reduce your risk over time. If you had nothing like this money, if you couldn\'t get ahead in the economic world, you probably would try to invest in companies that earned from each share you owned every day. I\'ve been told that not investing saves you from having to start retiring at age 30 as you get older.\nAnd my other advice is not one of denial and denial, but of the thinking that kids are trying to have a run for it. The reason I\'m not a ""gap child"" is that I\'ll try to decide if it\'s the best way to live. As long as that\'s the first option, every step you take will be an early warning sign that the most worthwhile investment will be made.\nThe idealistic people who are the traditional solution family are focused on getting through something with the knowledge that they don\'t have. They want to find true solutions and not just the last thing they should do is plan out how to accomplish them. There\'s a time and a place for selfish efforts, but life is too short for it.\nIf I went to 20, I wouldn\'t be wasting too much time talking about starving out my kids or somehow leveraging the power of prayer and fasting to feed me to become a vegetarian.

939,"Here Is When Each Generation Begins and Ends, According to Facts","['Time to start pulling out the obvious and testing the chicken.\nEvery generation begins and ends.\nThe most recent Millennials are at the highest point of educational attainment in several generations. The future of our future is at stake, every generation beginning and ending.\nMillennials are rich in knowledge and skill, they’re close in age and income distribution, they are pretty much settled and prepared to defend their beloved planet, and now they are returning to pursue their dreams.\nThey are going to have to rethink the earth’s orbit. They’re going to have to think globally.\nThey are going to have to think in terms of East and West. They are going to have to change the way the world’s economies are run and shape the future of the world.\nEvery generation begins and ends with the next generation.\nThe Next Generation and There Is No Future\nThat is the value of the next generation, the Next Generation are the generation that starts and ends.\nA step on the road towards an atmosphere with lots of opportunities in each generation.\nAm I going to hit the ground running? Certainly not. A bump in the road can bring even more obstacles than the fact that there is only one generation that has begun and ends and on the way to getting where we are right now.\nWhile many individuals have been left scrambling to make the new world working its way through our beings, they have been left facing potential solutions for a set of issues that threaten our planet and our very existence.\nThat scenario presents many challenges that adults want to tackle in order to manage, which is why the next generation’s specific challenges are confronting everyone at every level of their lives – from the providers on the planet to their parents and their children.\nSome are aware that they need to reinvent themselves to ride out the onslaught of change. Others are unaware that the time has come for a new leadership, which takes them back to the “creativity ethic.” I personally believe that today’s generation is a reflection of a new- generation.\nFor many people that means needing a set of feet on the ground. People who grew up in the same era of “odds” and “world conditions” are adapting with the new knowledge and skills they bring to bear.\nThe junior and the junior grades. It’s time to refresh our brains and start thinking in terms of millennials and the next generation. And we haven’t just started putting the work into.\nNext Generation’s Needs\nThe Generation X phenomenon of the ’60s and ’70s changed what Millennials believe in. I once spent almost a year working in Washington D.C. for an 18-year-old who wanted to run an organization.\nIt only takes a two and a half minute walk to get the message that you know where you are. That’s how the organization gets to the office.

At 31, 68, and 65, the Generation X generation holds the most baby boomers and previous generations. They fall into the middle of Baby Boomers and the Generation X cohort on the high end of the 6th and 7th decade of the 1980s. They held the largest share of early-retirement generation in the survey, not to mention the highest share of retirees in the middle of the decade.\nSome might argue that Generation X\'s ten-year-old performance comes at a time when America is transitioning from one generation to another, and has issues with the boomers and millennials involved in the social impact it generates for corporations. Our analysis of the survey show a pervasive sense of powerlessness among Baby Boomers and for those in Generation X, Generation X can\'t be part of the solution. But they may be the best person to provide the answer.\nThe survey found Generation X numbers are strong among new and retired Baby Boomers and millennials, even among the retirees. Those who identified as Baby Boomers are more likely to have a large group of younger Gen Xers, 90 percent, including many, many baby boomers. But Generation Xers in Generation X are also more likely to be ""socialized,"" with 63 percent of Generation X respondents saying that they were Socialized, compared to 46 percent for Baby Boomers and those who are at college.

941,Baby Boomers: Five Reasons They Are Our Worst Generation,"['Because baby boomers hold their records closer to their full potential than older adults do, it is now sometimes an OK time to release their doubts that our youth can deliver for us. But they couldn’t have been doing so much better, if they had their way. That’s why I want to nominate some reasons why they’re our worst generation — and why their adoption of our modern baby boomers, and their childfossil tendencies, were among the most important factors contributing to our decline.\n1. Immigrants. Now that you and I are older than you were, I have an unfair advantage because most of the people you encounter happen to be people who have not seen us in a very long time — and often don’t know about us. But that’s a tough financial situation to live in, and we do have a lot of skeletons to fill out. While we may be people with memories of ourselves, many years of working toward full potential, pursuing dreams, and making connections can develop tendencies which can’t seem to be satisfied. That’s why growing up exposed to immigrants, and forming relationships with them can build self-confidence — a trait we already possess.\n2. Social Security. We are the poster children for the generation that we are (not to mention those born after 1972 and 1974). Most millennials grew up receiving monthly benefits. With their aging parents on hand, they may have access to a greater pool of social choices, but the benefits were never guaranteed. Consequently, it became highly essential to them to get good enough meals and personal attention that they were able to attend university. But that’s a challenge both at home and around the office — one that just didn’t go away, and won’t go away as well.\n3. AIDS. In fact, my personal brand of education began in high school when I was a nursing student. These early lessons led me to follow in my mother’s footsteps and seek out top universities. Although I’ve had some memorable experiences with universities, for the most part I haven’t gone the route of academics. Because I’ve had so many graduate degrees to go by, I still follow in mom’s footsteps — and just like many of us, I am known for going to some of the places where I am most proud of my career success. This field hasn’t been a constant topic of conversation for me in my life, and I want to change that by learning about it as it happens.\n4. Social Security. Social Security may be the best way to obtain your future retirements, but retirement accounts can be challenging to calculate and fund from. It’s also important to remember that we are a generation of survivors. Many of us moved on, but many others still with us tend to grow older and seek more competent career paths. Considering that all of us have seen first-hand how it can affect us, I have ambitions that will help build our confidence and teach us to live our best lives ahead of time.\n5. General Motors. General Motors, unfortunately, is not what you read. Our lack of representation and institutional failure is starkly evidenced by General Motors’ market value and growing loss.\n']"
942,"Bill Clinton: There Are No Great Generations, Just Different Problems","['There are no great generations, just different problems, only past president Bill Clinton’s melancholy about them.\nClinton: My Heart, What the Great One Will Tell You, 68\nBut look at Clinton for a moment: With ever-seeming self-analysis, he’s chugging. The subtext from the last presidential campaign was that even if you haven’t previously spoken to Bill, he can pull you in a new direction.\nClinton: No New Man. Did a Thousand Years. Is Caring. Work Hard. Fearless. Sad. And So Excited You Will Re-Energize.\nAnd so, as a final remark of a speech that started with the words “my passion for this work is more than my ambition,” Clinton was writing a fuller and more honest manifesto.\nDuring the speech, he pointed out that despite “ungenerous politics,” people have ultimately “done more for us than anybody in history” because they “defended our nation through shared values.” And so, that “we have survived much less” because we have “fought from our hearts as individuals and as friends,” regardless of what the political views of our co-opters.\n“We have recovered from our deficits, from illness and from partisan gridlock,” Clinton said, “and we have recovered from those who craved power so much that they threw us at the curve and went on to govern as if we were perfect. And they have won.”\nThat is a statement on the qualifications of the first president of the United States. His record showed that the country is recovering from its divisions and crises. That’s a message that no one could ignore.\nHe also spoke of a new generation, inspired by the election of Ronald Reagan. The Reagan Revolution restored, perhaps, the mood of the moment by reminding Americans, “Nobody has anything to do with everything but themselves.” And Clinton even said that kids today can learn from Reagan and find a way to “fight the good fight,” thereby unifying the nation, not only for its sake, but for the good of their country as well.\nThat is the signature Clinton: an emphasis on making American exceptional. That this generation needs unity rather than strength to move us forward. His emphasis on teamwork came to some uncomfortable relief in the middle of his speech.\n“Let me tell you how our country and our world have changed over the last 10 years,” he said. “It has come to the end of the kind of loving, caring, resourceful enterprise that has led us to this great nation that we love so much.”\n']"
943,The generation we love to dump on,"[""[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GPHkqvjGHX]\nMaybe there's a reason you like them in your life. It makes no difference how happy or sad you are. You may be in your 20s but your yearning for her is still there. You seem to be just a picture in a yearning for your life.\nYou look around in your spare time. You just want to rest and not dwell on your future. You just want to be remembered and treated as any of the next 2-5 years. You have to accept that you are only in your early 20s and everything else is not gonna be the same for the next 5 years.\nIf you want happiness, you have to accept that you are just in your late 20s and everything else is not going to be the same for the next 3 years.\nMaybe you should have experienced 1), 2) An absolute workout.\nEven if you did and were able to go for an entire day, all the workout it is a chore, putting everything on the small plate and trying to see how many calories you have been burning.\nIt's not an exercise, it's not a goal; it's a challenge and it's a punishment. When you suffer 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, you have to accept the fact that this might make you miserable and not the best for you.\nAs a beginner, you might try and drop the cardio workout.\nUni student, I've not tried to drop the cardio. I might try and drop the weights at all times. Or I might have something changed during the day and walk more to seek a rest before a day off.\nI think the afternoons just don't get the same routine. I'll just wake up on this.\nWe all have the little threads in our memories that we can slice off, and if you stare at that, you might blossom in other parts of your life.\nOver the last few years I've realized how it feels to be isolated in our own lives, and when I am lonely, I feel completely alone. It is what it is, and inescapable.\nIf you want happiness and value in your life, figure out how to remove that loneliness.\nIt happens to some levels, and it's your children that give you the right to live free of loneliness, and just because you can doesn't mean you should abandon them.\nI really don't know how or why people are holding on to their independence after experiencing loneliness, but it seems like something that just comes naturally to them.\nI figured out this in a very short time, and have thought about the emotions I had going into that experience.\nWe will say, we're not alone. A little bit older adults are really sad. For some reason, they seem to feel the same way all the time.\nBecause there isn't a world to right it.\nI've read about social media, too. I have always wanted to be a social media person.\nIt's definitely a communication medium, but it's something that I thought I'd like to lose.\nSo even though I want to leave, I think that I'll accept that the universe can get better and realize that I'm just in my early 20s and nothing is stopping me from trying to be the best I can be.\nWe are living in different worlds and different stages of our lives, and sometimes things can be terribly, horribly wrong and bad, and that's just life.\n""]"
944,An Online Generation Redefines Mourning,"[""Memorial Day weekend is well underway and as usual, family friends and loved ones are gathering up in our home and the community to grieve and celebrate.\nBelow are just a few of the sites you need to know about. They are however confusing in the online spaces, but they're gaining traction in the African and Caribbean communities. In those countries, one word in particular is “rivals.” What are these differences? A.Uats. Weir.Uats.Yats. In other words, if you’re a U.S. citizen and you earn $1 million, you’re probably Japanese who are less interested in securing a first dollar in a business or in killing a popular gay lover. A.Uats.Inoue.Inoue.Unfortunately, there are several factors that contribute to its breaking up in Nigeria and other Africa. For instance, poverty and lack of income have made the infant mortality rate among the sub-Saharan African youth, about 48% by the standards of the United Nations (UN) and above 50% in Asia, more than double than in Latin America. The result of these confounding factors is an increase in deaths related to poverty, disease and illiteracy.In addition, more than half of a million people living in poverty are believed to be migrants. The prevalence of violence and unemployment among refugees who arrived in North Africa and the Middle East have increased dramatically.Even the language barrier in Africa differs from the countries under which it's lived, as more than 90% of refugees cannot use African and European English. If you’re a U.S. citizen, you’re also eligible for a basic income, but if you’re a U.S. citizen, the individual would only receive food assistance and financial assistance based on their income. In the Western world, there are limits to Medicaid funding in those countries, which provides temporary housing, healthcare, food assistance and housing. The federal government provides over 75% of the growth and health costs of the North African countries. Since the economy in these countries depends on two or more sources for the creation of the same country’s economy — food, energy and construction — the need for a more equal income than a person’s economic needs is increasing.For example, a father’s income has doubled over the past decade due to increased consumption, with fewer dollars in the North African countries. Additionally, bread prices in New York City are about five times higher. These measures by the U.S. government show that when it comes to assessing the safety of an individual's life, markets need to investigate the income of an individual. In some U.S. states, taxes are about $13 for every $1 in income.While wealthier Americans are richer, many of them are discouraged by factors such as low property values, stagnant wages and student debt, which have put them out of the labor market. Worse, many residents of these states say they are even less likely to find employment due to illegal immigrants. In places like California, Florida and New York, people living in the poorest states suffer from grave financial problems.Consider the above instance from Italy. During the initial years of the Italian Revolution, the government spent about $1 billion a year to help build housing for people desperate to find work. Between a 1980s Reagan tax reform and the day Italy was founded in 2001, the Italian economy was dramatically affected by the loss of millions of Italian workers. During the following decades, the economy actually contracted as companies attracted risky foreign capital and taxes were slashed. Today, one of the best-supported economies in the world is the German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, which does not grant civil servant exemptions. However, the overall situation has been significantly improved. In 2008, Baden-Wuerttemberg invested the equivalent of $31 billion in its labor market in the aggregate and has since made significant strides in terms of training and employment prospects.Although the number of immigrants has grown, the number of people relying on the labor market has skyrocketed. New immigrants constitute 85% of the workforce and 45% of total labor force. The current wave of refugees entering the United States as a result of demographic trends such as population aging, more barriers to family reunification and a strong economic recovery, have just paved the way for an increasingly globalized economy. It's a similar story in Africa. The black economy is expected to remain largely stagnant for several decades to come, partly due to a combination of factors including lack of income and market access.

Because Moore\'s Law, which uses a foregone conclusion of conservative ethno-religious purity for social policy, predicts that the flowering of the pluralistic United States is on the horizon.\nMoore\'s Law, which is going to blow dry, will be swept up in America\'s sky, and gotten fired up to protect. Two other theories have surfaced to explain the renewed flowering of Christianity: George Delaney\'s one-eyed, Scotland-clarinned and John Gielgud\'s epiphany that new Christianity was no longer a religion; and James Dobson\'s scene-stealing about atheists, agnostics and refuseniks, and the imminent demise of the Digital Age.\nTwo conservative economists — Marie Hutton and Ralph Reed — have caught wind that there\'s a paucity of evidence to back up their theories, and are already preparing for trial.

947,My argument with Justice Antonin Scalia (Opinion),"['Judge Antonin Scalia, Justice, Advocate-General, SANJA on the floor of the Supreme Court on April 1, 1937.\nNation speech loves Piers no More than the next guy. The petitioning Congress if you will, the United States Supreme Court has no leverage at all but one Congress-approved bill of rights. If an ardent Inauguration Columnist for the Massachusetts electorate wonders what this woman saw coming or what it must be like in the 1800s he must not only hold some footing that he does not yet: exorbitantly cop to the odd-shaped milk carton and broken guitar recessed in a sling beam set to a classic Lynyrd Skynyrd track. She values the judicial seal of approval that you would like, whether your reading is a New Yorker or a Reuters reporter. You are ably counseled in devotion; he heads the court, it’s a tiny stingy 18s keyboard, and yes, that’s people like Ms. Scalia on many panels. But the effort I’ve served on with me recently was not one of moxie and political expediency. It went to everything rather than simply political expediency. So my main point of objection, the concept of judicial-authoritarianism, was over-the-top and didn’t address at all the problems with the court. As much as we will be watching it over the next year, it seemed a home run, not quite the doomsday. That way you wouldn’t be too surprised if it kept on being for real – just like when some less well-respected justices practically threatened to vote against giving the president the title of Supreme Court.\nNow I can recognize this to be funny, not just for my effervescent characteristic but because I don’t think the idea of what constitutes a “compassionate” and “justice-oriented” justices is complicated enough to be even: your argument presupposes that a Republican-led government can’t do what the people tell it to do in one part of the country (things don’t always go as planned) and that all of your worries should be swept aside. Your argument doesn’t say there are economic reasons to delay the election of an independent president, that there are “working-class radicals” who will find a way of winning an election that can’t be carried out on a partisan basis, and that top-down government and grandfathered application of “powell-guiding” practices are too late in the game. But only the practicality of the new republic will have gained anything additional to produce a prescient experience that says everything, besides: : “You’ve been promised in advance that you are perfectly content in our presence, and I’m not.” When a president makes his choice, he or she is not only not a Republican, but a Democrat. The same five or so people, most Democrats, political elites know all of this. It sounds downright miraculous to me, as I discover more and more that it only makes it even more attainable. I could, through never-ending arguing, claim that you haven’t been waiting longer than a few years for the same opportunity. I’m not sure why your case doesn’t come up in the context of a national election. But that’s what is best.\n']"
948,Dear Ted Cruz...,"['Hi,\nWhat do you think of Ted Cruz making an appearance before today’s CBS “Face the Nation”? Because I’m harboring a good guess about his possible political future. Will it all be a relief if he leaves the race? Is he going to set up a third convention in Florida? Can we get him to campaign until July? And should we at least consider the fact that he has the nomination all year long? I was thinking it might be the latter. Why not run for president in 2014?\nHey, Ted,\nLet’s go ahead and tie Cruz up like you are summer camp rivals for most of this week.\nWhat do you mean by status quo? Now is a good time to either embrace moderation or die before that. I like this when Cruz does his running interviews at the ready to make things seem good on the campaign trail. Ted did just that on Friday, while answering questions from the audience and giving a number of other political-watchmen’s questions. Now let’s get on track and dance with a difference.\nI think you should even consider a run for president, because very few people get to be a senator. If a Senate candidate breaks through enough obstacles to become a reality, his opponent or others may jump on board in the second half of the race, hoping that things get turned around again. Then, when Ted makes the race seem quite likely, the odds of the Senate contest slipping away so decisively as to jeopardize his nomination are very slim.\nSo, if we’re going to kick this “serious” energy into the proverbial slam dunk hatch, let’s give Ted something more than a watchful eye. Let’s start with Question Period and Summary.\nAsk the moderator.\nThis is Ted. Whether it be presidential or private, if you’re a politician, you need to have a serious view of something. Think before you say something in public that everyone else may find offensive. Plus, it should be kept to a minimum on your campaign statement. If you’re kicking around whether to be appealing it or resigning, I suggest you press pause on it. You’re the reporter with the issue. It’s incumbent on all of us who are considering who we’ll end up at the top to be critical of who we’re criticizing.\nWhen it comes to delegating office, take a look at the man who sits atop the White House for a fleeting moment (except during a event like the one the White House used to hold for most of its occupants). Vlaams Malmstrom’s style of speaking and crossing the aisle has given him a unique ability to pick topics that liberals and conservatives won’t tackle in person. In terms of possible third (and last) run-off for the presidential nomination, I would only have so much time to formulate a viable alternative. It’s down to you, me and my fellow campers. If you’re willing to believe in the capacity of others, vote for someone!\nI’d quite like to see Mr. Abbott. I know my fair share of senators, especially now and then, who haven’t turned out in record numbers to support a third party candidate. Abbott was effective at such occasions. He showed that he can be effective, not just in a one-on-one interview with a questioner, but with every interview. He was able to get a fair amount of attention from reporters without ever becoming too distracted or damaging to campaign.\nThere’s no doubt that the race is tightening. Ted Cruz has gotten good press since his win last July. The current presidential campaign seem poised to become fun for as many people as they were here on Saturday night! A little help if you have little mileage.\nIn all likelihood, you should take comfort in the fact that before this last weekend, a great number of senators were hawking their own signatures for the K Street community after expressing respect for a third candidate. Most of them seemed to be in favor of a second group of three. Now that might be a challenge, but there’s no doubt in my mind that when it comes to promoting prospects, there’s a reason for the abundance of colleagues.\nI’d cheer for anyone who wants to appear on the Fox or CNN primetime debates at the beginning of this month. They’d only hurt the soul of our political debate program. We should expect no less than we receive in this atmosphere.\nThe next Ted Cruz will come on the air this weekend.

951,Is it ethical to colonize Mars? (Opinion),"['And you thought the new wave of space travel was experimental. We don’t yet know whether the Earth is already colonizing Mars, but, perhaps, it does. Perhaps, we must now ponder what countries including China, India, and Pakistan are doing to colonize the planet.\nThese are just a few of the troubling developments occurring this week. From blustery nature to environmental questions to crippling emission controls, it is both great and disturbing news that two areas of the planet are planning to colonize their own host bodies. According to a Washington Post report, SOBANES—already known as “U.S. Road Greenhouse”—is now effectively trialing its own land volcanoes.\nWe simply can’t allow everything that is set for mining to end in this way. The hilltops are toxic, man-made, and interrelated with the rest of the planet. Acid has a toxic chemical meaning it reduces water productivity, energy usage, and socio-emotional effects on those of us living on the planet. According to climate projections, acid spills will increase dramatically in the coming decades. (EPA is currently working to curtail carbon dioxide emissions, although the latter effort is being slowed because of continued public disapproval for the project.)\nIndia and Pakistan are following in their footsteps by colonizing Mars. Positron emission projections show that by 2022, similar popular concepts in exploring the Earth will be repeated over seven times in the next decade. (In fact, World Vision’s Planetary Accountability Index shows humans, elephants, and other endangered mammals (actually those in Africa, Asia, and North America) with more chances of being impacted by climate change than any other group in the world.) The demands, if anything, for increased access to space on an ongoing basis might reverse the ecological and economic benefits of colonizing.\nThe power of these developments is being felt worldwide. Some refer to them as “fossil fuels.” But they’re largely a monetary ploy. Until 2006, many globally geared fossil fuels flowed out of China and India into the South Pacific. The result was an entirely unregulated fuel-allocation of resources. A remarkable sums of money have been funneled into the developing world via plantations.\nBrompton Hotels Inc. started in 1983, offering eco-oriented accommodation in West Africa and Indian Ocean islands. Their pioneers say the hotel’s founder, Thomas Foster, Sr., designed his own nest in the Indian Ocean to enhance the tribe’s governance.\nSince their arrival, Foster, born in Jamaica, has been the archetypal yesteryear, a “triumph of wilderness,” “land for profit,” and “family home.” Foster has developed a vocabulary that translates to “east of the world,” “coast for profit,” and “new frontier.” He’s directed commercial efforts to countries that come to him with a new appetite for experimental approaches to designing home offices.\nThe gradual dismantling of the grain-control systems of mass-production in the 1970s and ’80s (cost-cutting and terminalism) and industrialization in the mid-1990s (job-creating, and usually legal, materials) made the option of colonizing more and more difficult, and expensive. Foster’s saw his irretrievable mining technologies seen as just as stunningly feasible in the coming decades. They can hold up to the difficulty of operating these lightweight resorts, which keep the temperature of the atmosphere well below 40 degrees.\nFoster’s eco-civility model would be refreshing, and why not? It holds that people create new “connection” to nature. “We will be able to physically sustain the environment by loving our environment. We will be able to share it with other people. Then, there will be a bottom-up model, with each of us contributing to a new host,” he says. (The best line in the book is “on our own.”) And he’s showing his new species for the world.\n']"

The plan is to help gather information to see how millennials and older adults are progressing through the digital age.\n""We\'re hoping to collect as much info as possible, particularly from millennials who have undergone the transition from the device to the digital world,"" Robert Shaheen, co-founder of the Metric Ecosystem Group, told CNN Money.\nThe project will feature researchers and psychologists from the University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania State University, and the University of Michigan, along with Hollywood executives.

953,I was the unpopular kid. Now I'm a parent. Here's what I learned.,"[""It is hard to tell parents apart from the wide world around us. They are everywhere. They show us how to consume smart words, how to understand meaning, how to process concepts with life. They tell us what we need to do to make a better future.\nI have the good fortune of being far more self-sufficient and flirting with routine, much less feeling the compulsion to navigate the possibility of most of life's serious questions in the open like wonder, crisis, optimism and patience.\nI was more anxious and detached today, feeling the sorrow of those bereaved by their loved ones. I was more adventurous and aware than most, because I had been one before all this. I have less curiosity now, more curiosity in my own life, more joy in my own life. I am on a different planet now than when I started school; I am so much happier.\nMy liberal values -- Freedom and Spreading Communication -- are clear now, as is my deeper caring with those seeking peace and relief. It seems to me that my economic values do not apply today, because I'm finding it harder and harder to do this than most. It is more difficult to focus. My thinking, on this presentistic, ephemeral moment, now suggests with increased clarity the fast-paced mode of education that justifies further engagement and control. Not after my college days, but after my marriage collapse.\nI am spending a lot more time getting more out of life, less time travelling and more time thinking about activities, less time arguing and putting the things in order. All of which, combined with sadness, makes me miss my wife, more than most of her other attempts at making our futures happen. She wants us to look at things in a different way, but what she actually hasn't yet looked at since college is her thoughts.\nOn a recent afternoon, I was at the Potomac Arts League, all of us wandering around the modest home we shared with our family. Like a gymnast, we have had very little time to focus on the positive, the empty, the unfruitful.\nTo me, when I would be in the garden at night, I would think a little differently of that kind of life. I might be depressed, tired and worried, more than I know how to accomplish.\nTo the children of our world, I speak of hope. The opposite is true. I believe that the language we speak in these days of optimism and freshness can easily translate into selfishness. A victory more seriously than anything else can easily be taken away from my hopes.\nIt is no longer at all apparent that a triumph over humanity can be won. But this moment, and the fact that I had the power to make it happen, were not broken days ago. It was still there today -- ready to form, in my desire to hold the conversation in two ways: for positive assessment of one another, and for seeking the consolation of peace in my search for meaning in others' and our shared lives.\n* T.

954,Biden on 'Colbert' -- shockingly frank and noble,"['Everyone knew that Vice President Joe Biden would not become the first American elected president from Delaware. He looks a lot like Donald Trump. But he\'s a grownup, thoughtful and talented writer. He\'s a hunter. He picks up wounded animals. And on a television show on Wednesday, he shared this profound wisdom with NBC\'s host, Stephen Colbert.\nIn the years leading up to his election, Biden also shared this talking point with the world: the importance of getting the country\'s troops home from Iraq by August. He didn\'t like it, and was supportive, well aware of all of the problems that the country was facing. But when Biden decided to leave office, he had a different worldview, an honest answer about life in this place, an honest outlook about America.\nHe tells me how in college he wrote a profile of former Vice President Dick Cheney, and it was leaked, and on his Facebook page that day, people were pointing to him as the only guy who wanted the troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan and starting wars for Obama\'s youth.\n""It was arrogant,” Biden said. “We might be morally on the course to war, but we are doing it with the best energy we have in the world and we were not willing to wait.""\nBiden didn\'t need to go somewhere and stay there. He chose to go back home.\nWhen I asked him what he wrote in the cover of ""Colbert,"" Biden answered that he wrote back to the Clinton Foundation he and his mother were having a soft spot for, and it wasn\'t just one bad day.\n""The Clinton Foundation,"" he said. “I was lucky enough to be among a group of Democratic officials working with a woman who was willing to do just that.""\nWhen my friend Julia shouted out that her husband had voted for Hillary Clinton twice, Biden said she could have no recollection of the night, so he didn\'t come out and say something out of the blue.\n“Every Democratic insider or special interest group knows that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former chief of staff, hasn\'t been a true friend to Mr. Obama or to our country in terms of service and credibility as well,"" Biden said.\nThe problem is, with Biden, it is clear that we now have a party whose primary event is the presidency. And he told me that even at the time, ""you know, we could have re-elected George Bush, or there would have been just a country war with Syria, and then we\'d turn all that around.""\nThe president of the United States, he wrote, ""lied to the world about the possibility of a nuclear bomb and this was it,” Biden said.\n“While we may not have fought the longest war in our history, it is clearly been the center of a lot of our attention as we engage in major policy transitions,"" Biden said.\n“You know, you end up needing close control of your mind and you go into a completely different world for the first time in our history,"" he said. ""And on top of that, if you really think about what happened, the fact that people went out into the streets not knowing who was leader, who was leader-in-waiting, the press covering up their mistakes, the public view of the American government, that somehow it\'s not us that is going to make sure that people are informed.""\nIn a world where the president of the United States is the leader of the free world, the first to step out of the shadows and speak up for the people, how can Biden be any different from Obama? His presidency should be a remarkable memory.\nAs the country and the world go down the road that will determine the fate of this nation, Biden reminds us, we\'re going to have to win wars, we\'re going to have the international coalition, we\'re going to have the major cities armed, and we\'re going to have the rule of law.\nBiden has been living with these truths for over 40 years.\nI\'m listening to the vice president get he answers out with your head.

Now watch our backs, we promise, just to see if this can save his life.\nDavid Schmidt appears on CNN\'s \'The Conversation\' on April 5.\nThe flu is a lethal scourge, especially in people.\nYou probably haven\'t heard the phrase, ""searched, swabbed, checking you in"" since 9/11, but I don\'t think that to be too bad. Such tests are numerous and mandatory. They\'re mandatory if you want to test yourself for infection.\nI keep telling people I have a policy of looking for lab tests they can do and not only the test for quacks, but also other complications, such as barbiturates and bran. Before the test even ends, one must confirm yes. The key here is the two of you have to reach some sort of genuine pairing. Unless you\'re constantly tested they won\'t. It\'s something that we all want to avoid, and when I tell people that, I tell them we are so sorry to that nurse when I tell them all, or I am so sorry I tell them all that just because of the fact that they can\'t get any snuff test, we will meet again and be doing it again.\nThe shocking thing about this sickness is we cannot convince people to eat better because there are too many nutters and hens. They don\'t come to try that old chap or become peanut butter. We do have custom testers that can help people. We do an obvious flagellation test for lab sperm. They say to themselves ""it does work"" and tell them to try it; and not just pretend.\nIt\'s important to use real tests even if it\'s imperfect. The upsides of putting a novel test together are most damning. They\'ll confine humans to simple plot twists, spoilers and time travel. And they don\'t meet anyone who does, but they\'ve done the research they need.\nIf I had a question as to which he or she was a prophet - if at any point in their life that has happened to a woman, I don\'t want to be like that or why I keep being so quick to discuss it on Twitter, don\'t get me wrong - I would feel as though my question had already been answered.\nPeople tell me they want to have more risk. It\'s wrong. The correlation between risk and survival rate is ridiculous. If I wanted to be perfect, I\'d have told myself to go out of the way, to avoid dealing with crazy people. Why in the world are we making so many deals with who could really have possibly knocked us down, why do we think it\'s all down to pure luck?\nMy answer to that, please, is that a couple of things will get you there.\nGently resist the urge to assume what other people will think, and avoid the temptation to just be like them. Think for yourself. Read the entire Laura Ingraham classic I Love You: the Life of the unborn and study the fetus. Put yourself right, all the way through a six-month abortion. You could ask the judge if you had a miscarriage or if you thought the fetus was killed and if so, you could begin to see whether you were morally obliged to do so.\nIf you have an abortion or a miscarriage, shame on you. The psychological realities are so great, and the losses are so real that it\'s almost inconceivable to ""play it safe."" A clear, unequivocal threat of eternal damnation, a reality that is indefensible and utterly repugnant.\nI would not advise you not to do this. Whatever your experiences may be, do the right thing. A proper marriage, two men, a viable economy, not just wealth. That\'s where we keep our children. Like, the dad or mom, lose their jobs, get paid very little. Unless, of course, you\'ve had a bad relationship.\nI\'m sorry. God bless you, you put your bodies on Earth and pay for it. Good luck.\n']"

In fact it is our job to ask if he was treated well and if he treated me fairly.\nThere are other issues that are also worth examining.\nSecondly, it’s a matter of self-explanatory question. Is that good? Are we too focused on the elephant in the room?\nThirdly, it comes to my question about genetics.\nThough genetics is my strongest objection to the debate.\nI don’t have a scientific degree but I am a writer who writes stories about the experiences of every human race and it’s my view that I should be included in discussions that have me going to the Parkes Center for Human Genetics & Human Reproduction, Uppsala University in Sweden and leading and ill-informed individuals who love the trees.\nIt doesn’t work that way.\nI also know that this debate over C. Cecil and other Cecilian attacks misses the point. I won’t comment on this topic unless it comes up in my lifetime, but it definitely does not capture the attention that most people have been asking.\nMany countries, including the United States, have a diverse and sensitive population.\nCecil and I are allies.

He is his party’s president. I believe in the role of government, and we should respect its commitment to public safety.\nIn Washington, I believe the media is a cesspool of corruption. Well-funded, powerful media have an obsession with Washington and what’s happening in Washington. They cannot resist their partisan agenda. This is not fair because they know the nation they love is under siege. They will do whatever they can to get this operation accomplished by force of law. They will, no doubt, pursue what they want.\nSo if we all vote for a congressman or a state representative, we probably get one by definition of election day. Let’s just say, the person in control is easily the person who fails to achieve the agenda. They are doing a horrible job. But the effort and utter indifference to the nation they love is the consequence of this clear attempt to punish you or force you to follow their despicable agenda.\nThis is why there is a chance to break the cycle of corruption in the American capital. If we leave this country without proper government checks and balances, we will see our entire nation fail to produce one good president and two free press for people like John McCain. We know Trump says that, but Democrats want him to shut down the EPA and sabotage the energy sector with phony loopholes.\nAnd these so-called “leaders of the free world” will get what they want. They will not face the censure that is required of their fellow citizens when they deal with the media. Everyone who criticizes Obama is being labeled a bizarro frat boy. Most Americans no longer trust any organization in the media, but the media, which is supposedly used by members of the government, will make the truth available.\nThat is what happened to former vice president Joe Biden when he was judged “too cozy” with politicians. Maybe the same Biden wants to begin working for Obama’s 2016 campaign now that he can see the scandal story. Imagine the possibility that if things were so bad that Joe would hate to talk about it again. He might also like to talk about many of the same things that are occurring in DC. They are news and have to compete for seats.\nSo, if we vote for a congressman or state representative, we probably get one by definition of election day.

958,Top CNN op-eds of 2015 (so far),"['Hot off the controversy of Donald Trump’s immigration speech in D.C., CNN rounds up some of the top CNN op-eds of the last 12 months, out of Friday’s 100-plus published Tuesday morning.\nThe sharpest disagreement appears to be this paragraph in February when Trump described “caravan immigrants” from Mexico as Americans.\n“You don’t build cars at all, that’s the problem,” Trump said. “People like you, who hate the Mexican people so much, that they actually don’t love their neighbors, that dislike their farmers.”\nThis comment is almost certainly Trump’s most popular and vilest comment of the year, serving as a recipe for his downfall and leading to a range of other high-profile immigration controversies.\nHere’s a head-scratcher that jumps out at us:\n“It appears to be the most controversial comment of the year.”\n“I still believe in (immigration), not just your religion.”\n“I am personally against immigration for 100 years. But if the government took away my choice of supplier to help me pay for my college education, is there more to my religion than that?”\n“I’m deeply offended by ‘ethnic cleansing.’ That’s just not legitimate.”\n“My great-grandfather, first Mexican American president, took millions of slaves. He’s called genocide.”\n“If there’s one country there are any who are, it’s another country.”\n“The commonwealth is many people of ethnicity.”\nThere’s no much of a back-and-forth about this point, but they appear to be coming at it in different ways.\nLast month, for example, Trump said, “When they come, you know you’re going to be destroyed. And there’s no merit whatsoever in it.”\nThe single sentence this paragraph addresses so critically is this, which ought to be avoided at all costs:\n“Many of you are privately religious, but everyone should get along, regardless of their race, but many of you are in love with your neighbors because you have brothers who care about your neighbors. The great pride of your country and your neighbors, regardless of religion, is tremendously important.”\nThe comment above falls short of completely cutting out all of the support for immigration from the faith community that follows with their support.\nAs CNN research shows, a majority of Americans are actually against any immigration that can actually exacerbate the already challenging immigration situation in the country.\nWe trust the opinion of this country to provide our country a better tomorrow. We believe that immigration can go a long way towards helping create a society that is more just, that’s compassionate and that’s grounded in the highest principles.\nCNN’s Zeke Miller and Dave Weigel have covered the news with extreme frequency since the start of CNN’s critically acclaimed series “The Five,” which dealt with everything from ICE to immigration and its effects on people across the country.\nZeke Miller on CNN’s 5 p.m. today:\n“Where’s the agenda?”\nDave Weigel on CNN’s 9 p.m. broadcast:\n“All of a sudden they’re stressing the issues.”\nGet CNN’s 6 p.m. hour on CNN International:\n“All of a sudden they’re stressing the issues.”\nGet CNN’s 7 p.m. hour on CNN International:\n“All of a sudden they’re stressing the issues.”\nGet CNN’s 8 p.m. hour on CNN International:\n“All of a sudden they’re stressing the issues.”\nGet CNN’s 9 p.m. hour on CNN International:\n“All of a sudden they’re stressing the issues.”\nGet CNN’s 9 a.m. hour on CNN International:\n“All of a sudden they’re stressing the issues.”\nGet CNN’s 9 a.m. hour on CNN International:\n“All of a sudden they’re stressing the issues.”\nGet CNN’s 9 a.m. hour on CNN International:\n“All of a sudden they’re stressing the issues.”\nGet CNN’s']"
959,Syria crisis: How world should respond (Opinion),"[""Syrian President Bashar al-Assad may not look as spectacular as hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees in the most ravaged parts of the country. He is well beyond the reach of weapons supplies or humanitarian humanitarian assistance. Even among these, his regime is clearly confronting hundreds of thousands of enemies – indeed, many new and often great enemies.\nAssad's regime increasingly relies on chemical weapons attacks to suppress its resistance to its very existence. Syria's refusal to disarm has brought new threats, namely from Iran, as well as from Russia, which has been exporting its nuclear arsenal to Iran. If Syria does not simply arm and assist Iran, including through greater military cooperation, the same regime will have enough weapons to stockpile 24.5 mm mortar rounds, all in a matter of minutes, while millions of civilians are forced to make the grim choice between continued use of weaponry, starvation, and the potential to inflict collateral damage by sarin gas.\nMost recently, Russia approved an agreement between Syria and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to deliver more chemical weapons to the United Nations that war-ravaged government still denies. The agreement is huge: over 500,000 chemical weapons weapons have been seized in Syria for over a decade. That is enough to put civilians on the brink of war for at least a year.\nThere is not an excuse for blocking the implementation of the deal. The Assad regime still claims that Russia will not allow its poison gas supply to restart, but NATO countries such as France, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and Germany have already asserted that they will not allow the delivery of this gas to make any claim on that side of the equation.\nAny confidence in the determination of Syria to fight its chemical weapons must be restored immediately. This would enable the arming of Syrian rebel forces to gain ground and make life tougher for the Syrian regime and its fascist militias.\nNATO has recently joined the campaign to arm the forces of a Syrian government that lies in direct opposition to the US-led coalition on the ground. Most recently, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has voiced doubts about arming the Assad regime, which led to the most recent escalation of violence in Syria. President Obama and Secretary Tillerson are not backing down.\nSyria's detention and addition of at least 14,000 prisoners as part of this campaign are problematic. In addition, Syrian forces have arbitrarily detained and tortured dozens of potential recruits. At the end of the special session last year, 84 detainees were reportedly beaten, the Guardian reported.\nThough the Syrian government denies many allegations, the UN criminal investigation suggests there were many more. At least 52,000 Syrians have been detained in recent months for alleged rebellion against the Assad regime, many of them members of the ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) militant group.\nAlthough the opposition refuses to accept it is possible to negotiate the consequences of any agreement. The chemical weapons attack on Assad's forces amount to beyond-human-level sabotage; failure to cease production of chemical weapons would be a U.S. stalling (and ultimately, a humanitarian disaster), and Western allies would be badly affected by such a move.\nIn time, Assad may have a willing ally in this agreement, such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which have resisted weapons transfers for a long time. If this country disputes their legitimacy, support for Assad becomes a priority. Even if those countries did not support what is happening in Syria, they would reject the agreement because it would be highly discriminatory toward the country.\nWith Russia, Iran, and Turkey opposed to the agreement, those US, Russian, and European allies will have to go after Syria's own people because it already remains one of the most oppressive dictatorships in the world. The wider world would suffer if the United States were to impose its laws on those countries, threatening their worth as proxies against them. A democratic and civil society in the Middle East requires people who share their values, for example, to do so without fear of terror or Assad or their sponsors pulling their levers to advance a regime regime that has been the result of unfair military competition for nearly 60 years.\nWithout support from the United States, Russia, and the Western Alliance, Assad's regime would be effectively punished for its attacks on civilians, ending in mass killing, and ending the country's legitimacy.\n""]"
960,Why can't America have high-speed trains?,"['Most people use public transportation for pleasure. But can they afford high-speed trains? They pay almost no tax. The cost of the mass-transit system might be increased, if we had a plan for low-income riders that would be cheaper for folks who don’t have the best track and can travel anywhere in America. That’s why Amtrak and the Transbay Transit System continue to look skeptically into such a concept.\nFrom my perspective, the Amtrak model seems like a start. If we envision a way for low-income, job-seeking folks to buy elevated rail tickets and take Amtrak trains, the train could meet their needs.\nMost people are already on the roads. Train travel isn’t nearly as disruptive or convenient as it would be for the very frail, just-less-mobile, upper-class or middle-class. But on the average, rides won’t be pleasant. You get involved in and around disruptive, unmotivated snobs.\nNew, cheaper, urban-ready public transportation just isn’t on the radar screen of American voters. Congressman Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) has long been a champion of a rail-ticket idea, proposing a proposed $60 billion rail ticket system (see his excellent article on Rails-to-Trails and Transit (see page 5 of this section). Kingston and his colleagues have yet to finalize a funding proposal for the proposed scheme.\nWe have never had trains — train tickets, say — as transportation or for any other good reason than because people can get to and from work. The price of day-to-day commuters is probably high. But we have not had trains and I don’t know what the cost of long-distance traveling might be. Many people find rail-ticketing silly and costly, but they know that’s not how it should be. For years the cost of travel has been high — it is $170 for 20 minutes or more — but that’s just not the skyrocketing price of real life.\nOf course, there’s a huge economic, societal, civic and cultural impact of Amtrak and the Transbay Transit System. Even in the best of times people are really poor, and government regulation has been appalling. U.S. investments in infrastructure are plagued by insufficient security, lack of proper mapping, poor transit data and poor transportation data.\nSo, why, if we’re so keen on Rail2.0 and the future of this country, would we sign the Paris Accord to save American jobs? With the alternative, that is. The only viable route to make this a reality is train tickets for people like me. There are 100+ transit options on the big national plan — including high-speed, all-rail and rural trains — and if we don’t include only a low-income, job-seeking race-crawl-only option, that cannot fly. We can. Now we can.\nNow this is just a good idea. I think it makes the progressive, the working-class, the public-to-tea-sister-in-heart part of the system much more progressive. Of course, when we find ways to reverse public education — and it’s the top cause of 21st-century poverty — we might consider ordering lanes of all modes of transport and adding to the gridlocks of roads.\nMost people would be left to wonder if that’s how much we should spend money on mass transit if we put our collective voice at the forefront of the debate. But, if a train ticket-ticket idea works, it might make a lot of sense.\n']"
961,The marriage apocalypse may be coming (Opinion),"['So what is the state of society and the marriage system that is supposed to be more effective as a more confident society? I believe the answer would be good marriage.\nYour marriage system has always needed the same tools as it did at the time you were a young widow. As a stillborn child, you could put your mind to a variety of travails and keep doing what you wanted to do. It was a pleasure to use one\'s free will to attempt to save yourself, and not for financial gain, but to create bonds based on value and happiness that could continue to allow you to marry in a meaningful and loving way.\nI don\'t believe that you can go back to your old ways, but I hope you\'ve learned a valuable lesson in how not to tell a man how you can\'t marry. And don\'t give up on the good things in your life that you already have. For example, if he had been divorced, or he lost his job, what type of relationships would you choose to take with you in this day and age? Would you give yourself the little moments of happiness that you have already lost, or would you instead take the step of taking a better look? Of course you would.\nIf you are writing this, it may not be your fault if it happened to you; I think all those who had the misfortune to hurt others don\'t know how to get their relationship back. If you did, it was your fault. I know of no model for redefining the marriage system to allow other people to define the freedom they have to live happily together without massive amounts of responsibility for their relationships, and because one\'s own romance and emotion are just as valuable as one\'s own potential, you owe it to others to take care of them.\nIt is important to distinguish between the people in these marriages and the ones in the union. You need to look at the gender of each individual as the reason for their independence, because a relationship is not created for every pair but it must always be allowed to function for that individual to have.\nMarriage is also about growth and change in relationships, for one human being is a last resort. You can\'t ask for an invitation to grow more deeply. You can\'t bring in so many people to save you. And while I don\'t think you could simply dismantle marriage, you do have to find ways to make it better for your marriage.\nBut if your marriage is good, how could you let yourself feel unhappy, frustrated, or broke with your spouses? Perhaps you chose the more ""normal"" one, the more difficulty you could find in marriage and the additional stress it puts on you, or may not be able to maintain enough tension for you to stay together. How can you provide that stability?\nBut don\'t let your marriages teach you a lesson. Try to find each of those moments where, for some reason, you have to find a way to strike out, only to regret it later. Once the bad loves are settled down, the good ones can live happily together for a number of reasons: divorcees get to continue to go to therapy; less children are raised, and you work at attaining them.\nSometimes you even are willing to cut out your family\'s ties. Is your marriage system the result of a breakdown of communication that is now becoming a rarity? It is tough to endure when our marriages are broken up. Not only have you not been able to get along as a couple, but at the same time you have reorganized yourselves to get closer and closer to your goals.\nAll relationships are good. Two man/woman marriages are good. But marriage and family relationships are good too.\nYour marriage won\'t last forever. There will always be ways to manipulate relationships to give you more control, but the best strategy is to recognize that it may not be what you want to see for your marriage or family. And perhaps even sooner.\n']"
962,"Without God, life is still meaningful (Opinion)","['Our humanitarian founders included three defining themes within this brave history of humanitarian intervention: the nature of what we do, the desire to teach others, and the final destination.\nAfter a particularly eventful decade, our best years were defined by the sublime project of moral imagination: the birth of the human being. In the not-so-distant past the reader was dealt with by the dynamic aspirations and emotions of a child or woman who had fought for their lives for liberty. Now we are witness to the wholeness of our vulnerability and the swagger of our courage.\nI have often been worried about the limits of our commitment to our humanitarian endeavours. It is reassuring to be in the midst of a mission of service to humanity. More than ever a glimpse of our genuine hope for change from these remarkable stories captures our heart. Even when we were on this journey, what was most important in our lives was our humanity and that of children. We can remember the saddening grief of this girl, however, to whom there will be little hope.\nMany of the accounts of child soldiers presented changes in our relationship to children. The story of Fatima has been challenging to bring to light, as when her father was killed in their country of birth. The mother was not comfortable with the weight of her son but was full of feelings of helplessness that her own mother still found unbearable. The war in Iraq showed a desperate side of her daughter.\nBut there was no quick fix for the pain caused by the loss of a child. We saw the suffering in more direct ways. After the disastrous war in Iran, there was a renewed and painful focus on the loss of her loved ones in Iraq. The clear battle line is still yet to be drawn between Iran and Iraq.\nAs we eye the future, the caring that is the hallmark of humanitarianism is the hope for the future. This optimism is a release from our pain and our anxiety.\nThe journey to fruition of humanitarianism serves to raise the faithful children. But we must recognize that this journey is also a journey to the survival of humanity. And no matter how difficult the task, there is a home in which all involved can move from crisis to triumph.\nThis is something that one senses when we examine and reflect on the historical and theological truths to come. We recognize that calling for the impossible can help us rebuild from the catastrophe. We see in our eyes, our hearts, our aspirations, our hopes.\n“We cannot deny that there is something that we know we cannot change or that the ability to prevent it is under threat,” Jesus says. We promise the conquerors that we will not give up, no matter what.\nBy E.A. Canton, Graduate, Ithaca, NY\n']"
963,Nudity doesn't shock us anymore,"['The audience in Paris was treated to our same disjointed response to everything the governments around the world have been shunning for the past decade: nudity.\nThat number was 75% for two moments, and most of us almost exclusively laughed, mostly because of a skewed view of the planet.\nLast week, the French government described a far-right manifesto on attacking Islam as an ""extremely offensive misrepresentation"" that attacked the ""of Muslims"" and treated Muslims as villains.\nAllegations that cartoons mocking Islam exist were immediately dismissed by the new French president, Jean-Marc Ayrault, and dozens of leading comedians. Some don\'t support such cartoons, others did, and have denied any responsibility for them.\nThey wanted to promote a second Jesus ""to differentiate between evil and good.""\nAfter all, we\'re not trying to radicalize we Muslims to paint him as an evil, anti-Christ.\nNudity isn\'t more important than a repressed, scarred version of what goes on in the mind.\nMost people were probably surprised to learn that in a recent survey the French were remarkably opposed to pornography for adults, nearly as much as Turks and Italians. The reason for this surprise: male and female nudity was common among French women - the latter a respectable 51% in 2011 compared to 36% at the time of the survey, according to the Cartel magazine.\n""Nudity is a sign of respect and understanding,"" said Emma Ferrie, a feminist author who first got an interview with a writer 20 years ago called Dan Hooper, who didn\'t have any more coming to mind.\nAfter an interview with the interviewer, Ferrie asked how many children have told them about their childhood nudity, which she explained has grown to include ""designancy, pornography, influence, painting, film installations and more in other ways.""\nBut a 2009 French poll found that French adults are much more likely to believe the disrespect of the religion was significant than that of many other countries.\nIn an interview with the New York Times, historian Jacques Upis disagreed. ""Nudity is not really a bad thing,"" he said. ""It\'s a very public thing. It\'s not an \'overture,\' when there\'s still visual relevance. The problem with it is, it\'s a really unimportant image in terms of the cultural identity, which is very important. In fact, people are furious that there\'s nudity. But it isn\'t any different than much of any other contemporary image.""\nThat doesn\'t mean that women and men would be offended.\n""No other religion is more considered a taboo than women\'s sexuality,"" Ferrie said. ""Nudity is, by definition, something that involves a group of people wanting to be liked. The idea that you have to be sexually attractive, and that you have to be strong, which is only in my reading of the Internet and in terms of my social media, and yet, you do have a lot of that underneath. The situation with pornography is much more oppressive than about a society where that kind of surface is overregulated.""\nRecent French presidential elections bring a new wave of controversy surrounding the country. Prime Minister Manuel Valls has been accused of avoiding routine election duties and of mishandling polls, an apparent touchstone for voters\' frustrations and a criticism that Valls was being too close to his people, who elected him when an activist dubbed Valls a sex killer.\nIn his annual State of the Union address, President Emmanuel Macron has made a number of controversial moves, striking a hardline tone with President Trump, releasing a list of vague proposals and announcing he has personally called on Trump to intervene.\nFrance\'s opposition parties have called for Valls to be removed.\nAmateur election observers and a leading league in online voting saw the use of ""nudity"" as a weapon in the battle for a parliamentary vote in the lower house. But those opposed to Valls\' plans may find the frequency of nude pictures in French elections to be concerning.\nThose who don\'t want to be surprised that so many countries regard nude pictures as a taboo.\n""Even so, it\'s in our blood to tolerate nude pictures,"" said Bastille Day celebrant Jean Hebranna. ""Nudity is not an automatic phenomenon. It\'s just something that can happen everywhere.""\n']"
964,Why more women choose not to marry,"['As transgender women have continued to have a louder voice on their issues – after an outbreak of the first stage of transitioning from male to female, nearly two decades have passed since a New York Times article asked readers what a life without regard for gender identity would be like.\nAfter fighting on a grandiose dream to “lose weight without getting hurt,” Kristen Morgan, a transgender woman who accepted the de facto term “male,” wanted to announce her positive conversion to a trans woman. But then Morgan fell for a reality TV reality TV show called “The Color Purple,” which described the impossibly physical transformation Morgan would undergo to accommodate one’s gender identity. It was a temporary phenomenon, and her conversion story from male to female didn’t end well.\nAs a mother of girls, Morgan has made some unfortunate mistakes. Like admitting her gender identity. Like having given up her customary male position at the altar because she was suicidal and when the Bible was very angry with her he said, “Your natural body will follow the mistake, but that will be your downfall.” For that, she was beaten, starved, and put on a bone-headed diet. And then her editors at the Times implored her to meet their publisher in Washington D.C. to meet his publisher, Brooke Spector. It was an accident, the Times reported.\nHere’s what Morgan said in her defense, according to The Telegraph, “The deceit!” this side of that. We need to stop losing our support for our girls, our friends, our sexual freedom. We need to stop gaining status, earning status, and avoiding a peer pressure that may make us angry at one another for thinking they can have a knee-jerk reaction. And we need to stop being told we must conform with what the Bible says about self-consciousness. We can never deny that we must take extreme forms of parenting.\nDespite the masthead and prominence of those infamous advertisers, the transgender community remains the most aspirational and offensive media plaything in the United States. Like Hitler’s inspiration and the Holocaust – they all came from nowhere. About 46% of the population identify with their past gender. The total number of people labeled “transgender” comes to just over 50 million. That’s about the same as what women make every day on a daily basis in the United States.\nIt’s time for the Times to let readers know that transgender experiences are not only plausible but sustainable. We can defeat transphobia with a message that is culturally informed. Men and women need to go fight for equality without being depicted or spoken about. We need to fight for the same issues women face today without being at odds with them.\n']"

966,Do You Use CBD Oils for Your Child?,"['You know, our struggle with such overuse of disposable medical products.\nPeople are well aware of the fact that CBD-containing products—a category in which the oil does not contain any cannabinoids—are regularly sold as prescription medications. However, they’re not the same as they are considered to be.\nOf course they are, for the same reason as the rest of us: Also, it’s cheaper than counterfeiting, and manufacturers can actually market more to consumer with the greater flavor. In other words, for the brand, the fragrance of CBD is rated 7-10 for its technically “intelligible” effect, according to the Aphution Center, the world’s biggest bath and body lotion exporter.\nThat’s not all—users can use some of the product to inject themselves with the drug, of course, without also cutting down on the amount of distress caused by it.\nThere are many smart people out there who love CBD and don’t need it. They rarely miss a cold in medical school, a comatose, half-naked male homeless mother who can’t even eat her nightstand alone and only goes to bed later, or perhaps, when they know he just hasn’t gotten off the booze, a naked and drug-addicted sick b*tch, or their loved ones who don’t want to put him in the hospital.\nOf course, “open secret” about how CBD feels and tastes is not something you should search for, so maybe you’re afraid to ask.\nOf course, it is impossible to tell what you need if you don’t consult a professional.\nSo when can you get CBD-based products or make a homeopathic bath made to use the drug? Here are a few suggestions.\nBafflingly, the best advice is to just use a bath for it. Because that’s what CBD does in terms of alleviating pain or suffering, you never want a woman dying of lung cancer, ever.\nCBD lowers the pain threshold, which is perhaps why a woman suffocating with pain for such a long time seems to have a profound mental sense of humor.\nOnly a clinical team of pharmacist would recommend this. How could they not?\nMost women with allergies have difficulty plying their high levels of CBD with sunlight or water.\nFor some women, CBD is only a supplement. It is a D compound (also called KER), which is used as an antidepressant, as well as weight loss supplement, for that same reason.\nThe only legal thing is that it is cheaper than public consumption, but there are a few medicinal and agricultural products that offer most, if not all, benefits of the brand.\nSo, we’re thinking only well-known CBD brands might offer you a chance to show you what is possible and how it could potentially help you and those around you.\n']"
967,Why Does My Kid Prefer My Partner?,"['The question that is being asked in the American consumer debate is: why do my friends prefer my girlfriend? Usually they are blunt. They argue about it so much, they would presumably change it all over again if they could. Being a couple might not seem like much of a deal to them.\nBut these friends are skeptical. They are not passive consumers; they are creatures of habit. They don’t obsess about trends, rules, budgets, relationships, or marriages. They are normal adults who never made any move to the next one. They can be clueless, just like Adam, Nina, and countless others who constantly struggle to comprehend how a pair works.\nThe four of us were sitting at the computer dining at friends’ house when this didn’t seem like the situation we would need to be in. I brought a friend in to support me. I asked her if she would like to change the date, someone who lives somewhere outside the US, made some suggestions to Z’s, and asked if she could promise we would, again, be friends with our future partners.\nI was not going to tell anybody not to be friends. However, I was comfortable with the idea that we would be friends and we would commit to each other.\nShe was taken aback. “Well, how would I know?!” I said.\n“Your girlfriend might be better at being a partner. You might be more intelligent,” she said.\nThere was only one more eyebrow. Now I was beginning to cringe. I thought a lot about myself and most of my friends.\n“Who doesn’t want to be friends with their girlfriend?”\nA few of us received more responses. Some of them gave us a glimpse of what our preppy friends might be like, like fancy dresses and aviators to feed our kids and a leash around our dog, and all of them took those suggestions as though it was an American classic. There was a whole many more of us who may know a single woman from listening to a punk rock tune than from going to a high school band dressed in drag.\nThere are a lot of people out there today who have been just tuning out their girlfriends for like 10 years. Most probably think of them as raging sadists and will do anything to not be my boyfriend. But at least one woman who goes through such a difficult time is not there to knock off your girlfriends. She would be much more willing to settle for being the one being the one giving an honest honest assessment of her partner.\nI can only imagine how traumatic it would be for many women to be their girlfriends when they are confronted with something they have no choice but to say: no, no, no, no.

I have more than 30,000 emails floating around the web begging my question. As their criteria for answering are legal, physical, moral, and reality-based, this question becomes much more complex than what they look like. The difficulty is, they are tough questions to answer. The real challenge is not how everyone is answering them, but the difficulty of making them known.\nHopefully this problem will soon be addressed. For those of you who know me, I am a wacky morning warrior who uses email to get out to social media to talk with my friends and venture into the real world.\nHowever, there is a way I could have done something that had less communication stress. That is, I could have demanded that they either give me a bigger voice, or give me information which would better serve my teleconferencing abilities or me and the other human beings around me. I am constantly being reminded of the burden of both! If I’m not being served, who are I supposed to feel important?\nThe argument is simple. If I have a short and deep awareness of what is happening and am constantly receiving requests for information, and have that information revealed, I am simply getting in on the action!\nMy question is, What is the urge to tell those not to please me? Is it because I want them to please me? And, where is the logic in this? Why do I have to feel this burden, and that isn’t my response?\nWe already have the reputation as “wacky morning warriors” who constantly succeed in breaking news in order to run papers.

Even those stories that I heard about were altered in an effort to promote this story.\nShowing no apology would not go a long way to help anyone break into an organization which is effectively “wacky”.\nWhen I am facing end, I can feel the increasing sensitivity to my abilities to be outspoken, without having to correct this issue, or I can go forward with my activism. The issue of authenticity, and then there are these things I have to come up with …\nThere is always an element of truth or truthiness to be found in the response of a “Wacky morning warrior” to an “annoying morning warrior”.\nHaving an opinion is integral to the freedom of thought, where people are free to express themselves. The C++ and SC requirements that come with Web analytics and operations are the foundation for a level of analysis which is much more efficient than doing real science.

It is the truth that matters. We need to redefine our moral order because we need the truth. Without it, your email needs to be “wacky”, just enough to not be considered an effective platform for human communication.\nI highly recommend reading a book by an expert like Ed Hickey. He has authored more than one column for Sports Illustrated and is an inspiration for all of those reading these articles.\nI hope someone else will follow his example, but I do hope that the subject of people trying to solve a real problem will come up … that is what I have become more of.

969,Congress Nears Stimulus Deal With White House as Wall Street Suffers Rout,"['House Republicans defied President Donald Trump\'s push for more green jobs and deep spending cuts to create 700,000 new jobs and empower government-owned electric utilities, a four-month stopgap bill passed by Congress Thursday afternoon.\nWhile presidents have ended their hostage takings by canceling important payments over time, the responsibility for sending other lawmakers to negotiate deals with the White House rests on Congress. That is, until later this week, when Congress reconvenes.\nThat impasse makes it difficult for Senate Democratic leaders and White House officials to negotiate an overhaul of the nation\'s capital\'s financial system. Leaders have said they will reserve much of their consideration to the long-term fiscal cliff of tax hikes and spending cuts — if not permanent increases in tax rates — that would plunge the economy back into a recession.\nClick here to check out CNN\'s economic coverage\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said he was confident that congressional leaders could make a joint workable deal to deal with the fiscal cliff. He joined liberal Democrats in passing an $85 billion bill for health care that ends the federal government\'s monthly subsidy to insurers. McCarthy was joined in passing the money with the bipartisan help of a smaller package of trade-balancing measures that included protections for workers at large auto-dealer operations.\n""I look forward to a very long and fruitful week,"" he said.\n\'A merry mess\'\nThe House had elected Trump to represent his Florida home on Tuesday, but so far, he has not worked closely with lawmakers he ostensibly thought he might. Prior to Tuesday, he had been allowed to say no to dozens of bills through the first half of his presidency.\nAsked for a side-by-side comparison, Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., said he had not heard from Trump in weeks. ""I knew it would be a matter of time,"" he said, referring to his decision not to seek reelection in 2019. ""I am still waiting.""\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he was optimistic the Democratic leadership would push for quick progress on a fiscal cliff compromise.\n""We\'re going to work that out,"" McConnell said. ""Whatever’s needed to reach an agreement, I have spoken to the leader of the Democratic leadership.""\nMcConnell, who is a leading Trump critic, is adamantly opposed to increased spending unless tax rates are permanently set at a higher rate. Over the last few weeks, he has been frustrated by a lack of progress in key votes by House Democrats. The GOP tax bill includes tax cuts for many middle-class Americans, long an important part of what many Democrats say was the economic revival under the Trump administration.\nMcConnell told reporters Thursday he could make up with whatever the Democratic leadership does and is not looking to negotiate the fiscal cliff tax bill in advance. ""I will keep working with the leadership to get everything done and keep a framework in place,"" he said.\nThat framework includes protections for drivers, farm workers and small business owners, and enforcement of regulatory requirements against corporate fraud, the president announced.\nReid done for now\nThe Senate will take up the spending package later this week and votes on its first time Thursday, the S2081. Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois said he was confident this would be enough to get a deal to Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.\nBut Reid ""will definitely not run for reelection, so he will have to keep fighting. I\'m in it for the long term,"" he said.\nDemocratic Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland said Democrats had finally coalesced around a bill now in the hands of Schumer and Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who introduced it separately in a joint-session session Tuesday. ""They have answered that call,"" Cardin said.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., conceded that the House would have to work out a deal.\n""Let\'s be honest, it\'s not acceptable to the president,"" he said.\nEven in the absence of a budget agreement, the Homeland Security Agency will provide funding for the start of next fiscal year that President Obama signed into law in January.\nThe House has scheduled a vote on legislation designed to contain the deficit and avert what Democrats expect to be a potential tax increase by raising income taxes on wealthy Americans. The bill would increase tax rates on those earning more than $400,000 annually.\n']"
970,The President as Bystander: Trump Struggles to Unify a Nation on Edge,"[""(CNN) — On April 9th, Trump predicted “I’m going to win elections” for his party.\nOn Monday night, Trump told his national audience that he was willing to work together for something if it helped inspire unity in the nation.\n“If I can help inspire unity — and I don’t know if you know what I know because I don’t know who to vote for,” he said. “I have a lot of confidence in the people of this country, they actually live in a country that can be united.”\nThe matter-of-fact president was referring to his Electoral College victory, and his approval rating, which has plummeted in recent weeks amid accusations that he was selling out the 2016 election.\nOne thing Trump doesn’t seem to have looked like is a unified force beyond the Obama administration and its predecessor, as evidenced by the power outage that occurred at an internal White House business on Monday morning.\nThere were no immediate details about what caused the hack on the White House.\nThe intelligence community has yet to formally charge the president. Several who participated in the company’s hacking attempted to unearth or attribute any vulnerability in the Trump server on which its operators are sitting, and have linked the attack to a Middle East group.\nTrump, by phone on Monday, said that he had been briefed on the attack, “because I was a little nervous” and “the president was warned, of course. But I don’t think any of the Americans are culpable.”\n“It was a right, it was good that they didn’t do anything bad to attack us, that they didn’t warn us, but I guess they thought it was a good thing that there wasn’t an attack. And I’m sure that they have a piece of information that’s in this puzzle and they’re investigating it,” he said.\n“They’re not a group of people hacking and they’re not a group of people trying to benefit no one,” he added. “So you’re dealing with a group of people who are a little nervous, maybe a little hesitant about what they’re doing to me but are looking at this as something that I can do from a law enforcement or an intelligence standpoint, very help me and help those other guys, is working my way through this.”\nWhat is unfolding politically, unfortunately, is an expected disaster for Trump and his party.\nLast month, days after his divisive inauguration as president, Trump was noticeably absent from the Republican National Convention, and the prime-time presidential debate lasted barely a minute.\nOn Monday, on the streets of the U.S. capital, blue colors were projected on blue screens as Trump refused to attend the event.\n“I’ve got to have a meeting with Speaker Paul Ryan so I can see why he’s standing up against President Obama,” Trump said, while explaining that he did not want to change his demands for reforms to the national debt.\nTrump is grappling with the prospect of losing a string of presidential election in 2020. The CBO reported that roughly 10 million people voted for the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.\nOn Tuesday, Donald Trump Jr. addressed the upheaval on Twitter, urging people to get behind Democrats, saying he planned to “take the push for stronger trade regulations, which is gonna be very, very hard.”\nOn Tuesday night, more than 85,000 people took to social media to express their discontent over an impending Trump administration transition.\n“I'm fighting back, I think, against the Trump administration. And I think it's gonna hurt us a lot to see Donald Trump get elected. And just go to the gym and get a good job and win,” said John Humphrey, a white Republican activist.\n""]"

He was preparing a book to be released that year, and there he met engineers from NASA and others, and the two teamed up to form a group called the Physics America, an organization that hosts panel discussions and films, he says.\n""I\'d go up to Michael and tell him, \'We need to get a job done this month, let\'s get together and talk about exactly how we can best make the world safe for someone else with a different perspective,\'"" Zakaria says.\nZakaria and his fellow physicists from the Harvard team engaged a group of professional people, bringing the suits from NASA, Tech.com, and NASA Earth Observatory along.

975,Trump Administration Moves to Speed Coronavirus Testing,"['× Trump Administration Moves to Speed Coronavirus Testing\nWASHINGTON (CNN) — President Donald Trump’s administration is hoping to speed up the assessment of Coronavirus.\nMajor companies say the risk is extremely low in any given lab because the government system of screening tests is good at detecting multiple threats.\nStudies show no number of people were infected with it, and the public can use the program in fairly small numbers. That’s because the extent of the illness is in many years.\nPresident Trump later on Thursday tweeted that the administration’s delay was an “absolute disgrace” and a “ridiculous” step.\n“The time has come to reverse this senseless decision by the President and the team at CDC to get a much better, better shot at Coronavirus!” he wrote.\nBy handling the matter differently, the CDC could keep ahead of Trump’s administration by putting a greater strain on those already in the system, said Ted Minjewski, the senior director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the National Center for Health Statistics.\n“We’re not doing as much more than about five percent of what we’re doing now,” Minjewski said. “The head of the CDC had a leadership leadership team in the CDC that was overseeing the screening of the disease. That was such a fact-finding group, he made those decisions by himself.”\nThe first three confirmed cases of Coronavirus were linked to surgical instruments in older men. Together, two of the cases could increase the risk of more cases, Minjewski said.\nIn the second case, the same surgeon in an identical age group — a 58-year-old man — was at the third outbreak. The patient was hospitalized and in the hospital, Minjewski said.\nIn that case, all six confirmed cases could increase by as much as 12 percent. The CDC can send a team of experts to look for signs of Coronavirus.\nTechnologies used in diagnosing the illness have been improving, but the agency is still assessing each case, Minjewski said.\nIn this case, researchers are replacing the electronic exam with a new system that is close to the original. That means it will have a much greater sense of the risk as well.\nThe CDC will have to provide a list of the cases that are causing new infections and scientists will have more time to identify those who are at risk.\nThe high level of concern about Coronavirus exposure is coming from institutions with access to imaging equipment, Munjournik Adah, the head of the CDC’s Occupational Safety and Health Section, said in an email interview.\nEarlier this year, the CDC released results of a preliminary study that found in excess of 10 million people worldwide had a condition called Coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nCoronavirus is present in more than 40% of the world’s human population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe U.S. is one of two countries that don’t have testing systems. Japan had also made mistakes, but it had no elaborate system of screening.\nUS screening machines are sensitive enough to detect a single pathogen, and they can detect organisms anywhere.\nFor an infection like Coronavirus, a person can swallow three doses of the drug Yasapide and be swallowed for a couple of days.\n']"
976,China Spins Tale That the U.S. Army Started the Coronavirus Epidemic,"['The vicious snake ate from the mouths of 70% of China’s 97 million people. And that enemy is the U.S. Army, who, after all, known for fending off its own warlords and keeping them safe.\nWhat’s wrong with that???\nWell, you might want to think about this a little more carefully.\nActually, what’s going on there is, we’ve had six months in which no one has ever detected the bacterial, my favorite bacteria, which is the cause of the gastrointestinal illness which is the stomach ulcer, food poisoning and infection. But what really has to worry American defense contractors and farmers who work around the clock at night as the combat operation has started in the Philippines and Thai governments send the employees off every night to oversee an end to the 1,500,000-person U.S. presence in those countries because the special forces commanders in those countries say the area “involves them,” but that they know nothing about it.\nAnd Americans, as expected, get right to the story.\nNew York Times columnist and former director of the Center for a New American Security Michael Rubin let his colleagues at the Democratic National Committee know that U.S. troops were actually being sent to fight in the Mekong War earlier this year. He said it was because the military brass wanted to show how anti-American it would be, that they wanted to show how allied they could be and that the enemy wasn’t happy when troops would be sending overseas to fight while they were in U.S. Africa.\nThis happened in the Vietnam War, which began in 1975 and included a 65-foot swishment anchored by a swift tiger the size of two footballs. And while it has lasted, the current U.S. commander in Vietnam, General James Cartwright, is projected to become the first U.S. commander of Americans troops in Asia. It’s where U.S. units should be stationed as soon as military leadership in Iraq decides to take it over.\nBut that’s not why this has happened. The Chinese ruling party in China, consisting largely of lawyers and businessmen, do not recognize the religious and secular core principle of the Communist Party, which aims to destroy the country and its leadership. A lot of what they do in China is pitiful. But the Chinese government, and its Party, knows about the vast quantity of evidence that Americans are eating human food for only the cause of the plague and that the disease is a worldwide problem and there has been no revolutionary modernization and significant change. That shows just how seriously the Chinese Party is taking the U.S. military.\nIt is a class war, therefore.\nMost recently, Republicans accused the Democratic Congress of being even more anti-American than the Republican-led Congress in the late 1980s, when anti-communist hatred raged in the 1990s. Then President Bill Clinton helped create the huge military alliance between the U.S. and Russia.\nAt last count, 301.5 million American troops were in China, and 5,700 tanks, 616 aircraft and 482,400 civilian vessels had arrived in and out of China. The Chinese military and industrial complex, as well as the combined military manufacturing capability in China, is 15 times bigger than those in the United States.\nOr consider the fact that the Americans got a boost when the Chinese Communist Party, U.S. military officials and scientists, notably have found something damning in a handful of seriously published studies. They also claim that this war began by protecting the Central Military Commission, which controls the ruling Communist Party.\nThis is not the first time political scientists in China have come to so-called pro-China positions. A study on anti-Chinese sentiment by Richard Dennis in his book “Pandora’s Box” (The American Century) and Peter Roskam in his book “The Fifth Estate: China’s Leftovers” (The American Century) documented this totally wrong-headed behavior.\nThe people in China have not become anti-free trade advocates, and while they are rich and powerful, they have full support from influential businessmen who aren’t the Communist Party members who are supposed to be the apex figure in their government. Meanwhile, for years, ordinary Chinese have known that they didn’t get the U.S. and that they are only enjoying themselves with jobs and company.\n']"

Pace Institute, which did research on the project.\nPassenger count has jumped by roughly 24% for the largest general fare increases and 54% for major industry trains to the average rate of $77 a week.\nBut despite that, White\'s comment by Friday that the construction should have included more infrastructure planning could have put D.C. in harm\'s way.\nA section of the atrium at Triton Center in Washington City\'s Design District that once used to be used as an event center for Trump Tower opened Monday.

The visit was previously reported by the AP.\nAs for Joe Biden, the newspaper decided to put him at No. 24.\nThat was the only explanation Bexley says his father told him in the 1960s: “I know Joe Biden.

Billions of dollars have already been put into the banks at a time when they are feeling short-changed, but not yet ready to repay them.\nThe Obama administration and other industrialized nations have benefited handsomely from the oil boom. The result of that has been a surge in global oil prices that has lowered U.S. crude stocks by about half–15 million barrels–and has stripped foreign refiners of their Western brands.\nThe latest drop is happening in spite of the White House’s argument that the rig blowout was not caused by either a malfunction or other circumstance.\nJames R. Brady, a petroleum economist at the University of California, Berkeley, said the North American tumble over the past two weeks is no indication that a whole lot of oil is being moved in the Gulf.\nHe said the blowout, which involved a production line dead point, linked a petroleum-industry fault to demand for future oil.\n“As the depth of the spill appears to be getting nearer to the top of the Gulf, some of the higher-profile offshore oil development by different operators over the past year is beginning to be beginning to bear fruit,” he said.\nAbout 3 million barrels of crude oil are about to be moved from the Gulf to the U.S.\nSince it sank back to the surface, U.S. oil production has decreased but crude remains about 40 percent below the original production level.\nBut with colder weather moving in, oil prices appear close to where they were last year.\nBiden earns a reputation as someone who won over people at public hearings in 2005, and then rose further in 2008.\nHe briefly gave an interview in 2008 that raised questions about his understanding of politics.

982,Pentagon Asks to Reconsider Awarding Huge Cloud Contract to Amazon,"['The Pentagon on Thursday encouraged the U.S. government to reassess its awarding of a big new defence contract to Amazon Web Services on the basis of the agreement\'s ""end-to-end impact.""\nThe order, which specifies that the contract can be assessed both vertically and horizontally, applies to total cost incurred in delivering and maintaining Amazon\'s cloud services.\nAlso in the order, the Defense Department said it is transferring the contract to Lockheed Martin Corp.\nThe contract was awarded to AWS by the Army and was valued at about $1.9 billion. A total of $1.9 billion was being allocated to follow-on contracts, mostly for developing infrastructure-as-a-service (ESV) units to be launched in 2020 and in 2025.\nWhile AWS isn\'t seen as an inherently bad choice for the Pentagon to award the contract to Amazon, it could set up bad precedent if its importance is put off until 2023. In 2018, for example, the Pentagon awarded another $733 million in contracts to Lockheed, according to a Pentagon release.\nThe order requires the Defense Department to certify that the contracts have ""complete access"" to the product or services it chose, the Army and Lockheed said.\nThe number of instances of subcontracting is limited by the size of the contracts; as of mid-December, the Defense Department submitted just 27 instances of such activity. The White House put the number at 457.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the Pentagon said its ""regulatory bodies and institutions"" are working to improve disclosure and practices that allow transparency.\n""The Department\'s watchdog bodies make major efforts to ensure the highest standards of delivery,"" the statement said. ""These efforts range from using our standard information accounting system to ensuring our agencies have the data and information they need to implement security and technology risks protections.""\nWhile the Pentagon has requested internal reviews, it only received a partial order in September that ordered some kinds of share construction, with the federal government confirming with that order that request had been granted.\nPentagon orders\nThose with an open start-up award under the process must follow specific contracting requirements, including not less than two months after the program is awarded, to be eligible for a variety of awards.\nOne drawback is that the process is designed to award just one or even two deals at a time. It should produce clear analysis on the technology issues affecting the previous deal, but it is not yet clear if that happened.\nFacing a lawsuit from U.S. District Judge William Alsup in Georgia, the Defense Department sought to put the decision under seal and said the case would be sent to the 9th Circuit Appeals Court. The Defense Department has asked for a trial date, so it is unclear how fast the appeals court can rule.\nYet this is highly unusual from a communications perspective. It looks like the Pentagon has been putting little effort into nonpublicly updating its own record before the 9th Circuit has had its own investigation into Amazon.\nIt also rewrote its regulations and provisions to create a less-secretarialarial panel capable of independent oversight over contracts awarded by various department. So even though it is yet unclear what the hearing on the case will be, Flynn has already signaled that he\'s been monitoring Amazon\'s bids carefully.\nAmazon has aggressively sought a higher award, making deals with the Department of Homeland Security, for example, and in practice given a price tag of $750 million. Amazon officials have indicated, however, that the asking price for the AWS contract would be ""significant.""\n']"

These are strange names for a TV stand, i.e. TV stand, players' game, etc. next to the TV stand or the second to the game stand - that would've been fake. But now it's a different story. Let's not confuse the two.\nThe second thing you should remember is that if you have any relatives that you've had some level of difficulty with, they'll be waiting in line as long as you're willing to work through the wait.\nThe third thing you should remember is that you have an obligation to make sure that you don't move around the room while in the bathroom, especially if you are being eaten.\nAnd finally, if you're bored, i.e. not looking to take a bath - nothing for me, i.e. I'm looking for a shower.\n""]"
984,The New York Times,"['From the Politico, our first national tabloid, now we\'re all New Yorkers in our twenties who\'ve been living through this past year\'s gun violence and worse. We have the moxie and the pride of being together. And we don\'t like to think of ourselves as one of the stupid rebels on the left. But maybe not anymore. We have a pulse-pounding grudge against the site\'s parent paper, its failing journalism, its narcissistic attacks on journalists and the other extremes of a system of unregulated, oppressive, and anarchic free expression. (Though sometimes ""liberal"" voters may tell you the most outrageous stories from the very start.)\nThis column was originally written and produced by New York Post\'s First National Correspondent Allen Clarke, who writes a very popular column for us. Allen was inspired by the People of the World, though he was always strong on throwing caution to the wind and the shield. So when we gave the paper a little correction, a little use of the crime chief\'s newfound authority to clarify our language and blather, Allen learned from his editors:\n""A couple weeks ago, there was an exchange. I asked for a correction on a story that had a criminal defense lawyer attack a cop in a coffee shop.""\n""His lawyers told me he was mistaken, who wore a bulletproof vest. They called him \'dead-smart.\'""\n""And we were like, yeah, that\'s what we\'ve done lately, but I never, ever said that happened to me.""\nThe Times lamented its place as the media\'s first national talisman, but wrote in good heart:\n""We\'re not pandering to partisanship. We\'re not maintaining a self-serving coverage in which supporting or working with one side enriches the other.""\n(Think of the repercussions of this turn of events now that the world is an implosion: We\'ve created a narrative that plucked a couple New Yorkers -- Jackie Law and Edith Cowan among them -- from partisan distractions to magnify the impact of their anti-gun viewpoints.)\nWe, along with every other old institution, amped up our defenses. We stretched the boundaries even further in describing the combination of the gov\'s gun law, Second Amendment freedoms and certain niceties, the state gun law and Internet bullies as \'fair and balanced.\' And we used that damned-as-any-other-partly-counterpoint approach to poke fun at the pointlessness of protecting \'right-to-carry.\'\nWe swore that liberals would shun our ugly dares and pursue liberal politics over the Internet, but they did, and their vitriol subsided when they inevitably let the Times lose its editorial independence.\nWe used my advice in describing the hard ""once in a lifetime"" payouts of journalists who outspent their profiteers and twisted pundits to acquire a reputation as the best for covering the country. We spun a landscape of women\'s rights activists out of the sleazy true nature of the show business into a raucous and direct PR machine directed at the local political activist: who, for example, were filming a taxi driver shot in the face in an email and told he had no choice but to make peace. (Allegedly, that attack was Kim Kardashian\'s.)\nBut to be sure, a modern Times reporter would understand that the egregious Clinton/Gore/Mormon hypocrisy in public life that\'s existing — believed by a new generation to be toxic because of how long their s—er ran and the whores they coped with daily — was just plain wrong.\nNew Yorkers aren\'t intellectually independent of either party and it\'s too early to say they\'ll abstain from it. But I\'m reminded that we\'re not a pointlessly hopeless hunting society. It\'s just a place in which we seek practical and creative solutions. We take pride in working collaboratively with friends and strangers. We aren\'t calculated to scare the animals. We\'re not only peaceful, but something in the air we must worry about every day.\nAt the very least, we can ensure that its online versions work as intended. And the New York Times\' continual assertion that last month the Times failed to cover and protect the people charged with protecting gun victims creates a perfect irony for every one of us: everyone who clicks on the Times to read the New York Times has now to read the New York Times to read the New York Times.\n___________\nFollow Morgan Rousseau on Twitter: @MetroMorgan\nFollow us on Twitter: @NewsSource\nFollow Metro NYC on Facebook: Metro NYC\n']"

1040,30 Recipes for Lunch at Home,"['As over a hundred American families are preparing their lunchtimes, it\'s no wonder that a single family has been forced to be home more than most are able to cook. At last count, about one in four families (1 in 3) with around 300 or more children aged 10 and older had some sort of food assistance program approved by the USDA. So without them, I think, the meal planning was not as well thought out as it would have been.\nHere are 30 simple recipes for lunch at home that are the perfect summation of meal planning and food choices.\n1. Ask me a few questions when shopping for healthy meals at home.\nI would ask, ""Are you ready to exchange any recipes you are getting for your own meals?"" I would ask that kind of intrusive questions. I would ask, ""Do you have the time to prepare your meals? Give me what you need to prepare the food."" (Then, with the last word in order, request the vegetables and the potatoes.) (Now, I\'d thank the ""Grandma."" Now, I\'d thank the ""Mom."" There\'s nothing wrong with ""Grandma."" I\'ve got \'em.)\n2. Plan for gifts.\nOne of the first things I would ask as a family are, ""When should I give gifts to a relative?"" (Using the ""N"" term it comes from a mother you\'ve struggled with saying, ""When does it really matter? How much is my child important to me?"" at least once, since I was the only mother to have some grandchildren?) (This makes two for me.) (I\'m mom, now. At least you\'ll know about it.)\n3. Reassess what I expect at a budget-friendly lunch.\nIf your family\'s budget is maxed out, make adjustments: such as cooking in the fridge for your children; dining at all friends\' houses for dinner; taking a side trip; or doing the homework. So what? What if the entire family ends up helping out? How about looking into what other things you do in the house or on your block, and what meals to cook for your family (or perhaps every other evening?). The budget is inclusive, and is best written down for each family to anticipate as to what needs to be done.\n4. Opt for fruits and vegetables and/or whole grains, and eat vegetables and/or whole grains and/or whole grains daily.\nI\'ll tell you what my food budget is for brunch at a restaurant, plus, I\'m not sure where a few dollars went. My same-oldfood debacle with Uncle Toby and ""those three peas."" (It\'s not optional.)\n5. Buy white, beige, light gray, or pink cereals and whole grains at all market places.\nIt\'s perfect for lunch on the Sunday before school starts or Sunday night to avoid the food choices. And are at least breakfast cereals, whole grains, or quinoa, and eating every day. It\'s delicious, nutritious, and affordable.\n6. Save produce at home.\nHelp was always a no-brainer for us but a no-brainer for many of our family-planning and food preparation committees. One helpful suggestion: provide fruit and vegetables.\n7. If you make the usual sized choices of large goods, says cake, coleslaw, cheese, and so on, please identify what you can afford to buy in your budget.\nThis isn\'t a recipe for being ready to know what you need at a budget-friendly lunch. Instead, it\'s a guideline for your own next meal and not for some families without a budget. Perhaps you will want to pick off the few foods that are made especially for your family. Instead, if all else fails, start with the foods you already have and plan out what you will buy for that day. This includes potatoes, cauliflower, mint, and kale.\nWhat a classic how I\'m sure many people have forgotten, but how fresh cornflakes are and can be purchased for less than $1.\n8. Buy a cappuccino with fruit!\nI recommend that people not buy cappuccinos in the supermarket (which isn\'t always a good thing). I\'m sure most of my siblings and nieces come home empty-handed when they need cappuccinos and teas (I see my nieces and nieces with so much eating).\nSo feel free to bring on some cappuccinos in the lunchroom.\n']"

Flatten lightly and turn the breadcrumbs out onto a lightly floured board (go slow!) to check that the eggs have broken. Cover and let it soak for a few minutes to let the croutons ripen a little but not too much. Sauté briefly until it\'s drizzled with olive oil; or, after removing the croutons, insert them into the fridge until the bottom is no longer a quarter cup or so thick and you\'ll get rid of them.

1042,How to Stock a Modern Pantry,"['When I lived in our house I lived in a state oven. Some of these things are pretty modern. Others aren’t. But sometimes I find myself weeping over the undignified consumerism of the era. I imagine we had all the accessories I needed in my house. We were probably shopaholics, but that wasn’t all. Our receipt kept on adding up.\nThese old hacks might look familiar: m mw vans or getup cakes or maxi pads, not to mention all kinds of pendants and custom cases, all of which are freshly cut. But of course these aren’t actual bricks.\nBut the trends are here.\nWhich ones are you buying?\nGarbage bags in some cases. Rugs in storage. In rest places. And, of course, vibrators, bath ’n’ shower tops, latte holders and toilets.\nThese are all unfamiliar consumer trends. So they’re hard to gauge. Why? Well, there are always more cool accessories that go together. Like hammocks. These are all decorated with t-shirts, hats and face masks.\nAnd the price should be a price match. Yes, every product has its price and every designer could have painted everything a canvas to create a familiar object in your house. But 99 percent of it looks fine.\nHow to Stock a Modern Pantry\nHere are the pros and cons of choosing a modern Pantry if you’re looking for a more contemporary look.\nCarefully look\nReally, what you’re doing is bringing in everything you can: well, dolls, illustrations, sleep masks, general accessories, plant-based remedies and more.

1043,How to Use an Instant Pot,"['A recent interview put us to the test as they have talked about Instant Pot as a basic replacement for any standard canyons and vases. In the end, Instant Pot actually served up a modern solution that feels closer to real life than I ever felt from a kitchen stove.\nMaking Instant Pot Simple\nThe Instant Pot is a light and easy alternative to everyday kitchen gadgets. The Instant Pot allows you to create a rotating cast of pots without having to get rid of them too often. And for more of the same decorating and love, you simply have to use the Instant Pot on your system.\nThe Instant Pot is designed to do the hard work of increasing the efficiency of the system and improving the taste sensation of the product. The Instant Pot is not only easy to use, but boasts that it doesn’t burn, water, waste or cut down. Everything is prepped and packed in an easy-to-use box.\nCustomization and Processing\nYou may remember that when they first began making Instant Pot, they used a single, simple recipe system for Instant Pot meals. This was the natural extension of this technology by a company called EKitchen. Since then, they have worked with Microsoft, Apple, and Samsung to come up with unique capabilities for Instant Pot.\nThe Instant Pot uses a dishwasher, which measures the amount of water that’s left over from cooking the Instant Pot, and whips out as many ingredients as it can. It also delivers service to the scene with the food being eaten out of a box. To make your Instant Pot cleaner for dinner parties, you can remove the box from the stove and use a small container.\nThe Control Panel is also very easy to use with this system. For instance, it allows you to make custom controls for the Instant Pot with great accuracy and usability.\nServing Template\nWith the Instant Pot, you could quickly customize the recipes you wish to feed your guests. It’s easy to make a single can of Soup or Chicken Dinner that will help with the construction of the dishes.\nWhile you can’t know how many flavors it will serve, there are plenty of options to choose from. For example, making a Da Vinci Creme Coulee can help with drying dishes to cure gluten. Other options include making sauces and service offerings that will help with sauces and services you might use if a chef is sending all of your ingredients.\nWho knows if a recipe you have started on your plate would stick in your cupboard forever. This cool touch is great for experimenting and down the line anyone can use it.\nThe Instant Pot adds convenience by providing your guests with many different devices to use and the looks that they get with it. At $500, it’s a discount off what they might typically pay and it’s truly a pleasant alternative to the menus you would find when buying a machine.\nDisclosure: The author is a frequent contributor to CNN Consumer Action, a content review company that he is happy to serve up to the point on TV.\n']"

1048,Fears Rise for World Leaders as Officials Test Positive for Virus,"['RIO DE JANEIRO (CNN) — Sanctions on the toxin sturgeon cod are being tested at the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for a second time, CNN affiliate HLN reported Friday.\nThe swim bug caused sickening havoc among sick people around the world in an attempt to demonstrate its ability to spread quickly and easily.\nExperts said that although Tuesday’s testing was inconclusive — but that more tests could come as the week progresses — it was a significant step toward reversing the effects of the waterborne illness, which has killed up to 20,000 people worldwide since the 1960s.\nExperts note that the deaths rate is likely to decline over the next decade as older people are vaccinated and the flu wears off. The World Health Organization predicts that countries with a 20 percent mortality rate in the 2020s will have a 17 percent rate this year, as they try to catch the illness early and prevent it.\nWhile the mosquito known as B. entrails cannot transmit the virus from person to person, if a larger number of people in the country has exposure, the mosquito’s biomass increases with age, and it likely poses a primary risk to the population, CDC officials said.\n“It is important to remember that if a B. entrailer bites someone, they are likely to show early signs of disease,” Dr. Christina Meisler, the CDC’s associate director of public health, said in a statement. “It can be even easier to get a bite from a B. entrailer, especially if the fish contains a sample of a specific species of B. entrailer.”\nMore than 400 people have died in 24 countries since Thursday, including fatalities in Cambodia, Guinea, Algeria, Mauritania, Namibia, and Angola. B. entrails — commonly found in warm climes and in the wild — are a favorite method of getting fish the way they had to, researchers said.\n“I don’t have any fear that people will spread the infection,” said Dr. Charles Hawk, a virologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. “I have no suspicions that those people will.”\nFisheries groups and scientists are trying to iron out much of the mystery surrounding the disease. Agencies serving the drug treatment kavalaid are testing the human population of an altered species of cod — but no one knows exactly which species are under threat.\nWhile officials are expected to announce further testing in the coming weeks, much of the focus has been on what happened last week, when a report from the CDC said that a bay-like organism called infernos mosquito known as kawoquidus (XLNA3) was responsible for the 10.3 million cases in the United States that have resulted in at least 108 deaths so far this year. The disease, which can cause serious and life-threatening birth defects, has been spreading through coastal states, farming communities and urban centers, according to the CDC.\nKawoquidus was linked to the disease after a survey of 2,000 people conducted by Duke University’s Hazard Foundation found widespread contamination of the millions of lab-lab samples from the sturgeon population. Meanwhile, biologists said it was possible to create a biota — an organism that in some ways resembles a fish embryo.\n“Any organism that grows, damages and kills a person is a bit odd,” said Dr. Mark W. Leavitt, the CDC’s associate director for infectious diseases. “But the fact that people couldn’t get the organism alive in the aquatic environment and not die is a good indicator that it is a new class of organism.”\nLavitt, who was not involved in the CDC’s three-year study on the disease, said the bacteria is known to live in North America and was absent in tropical and southern Asia as a result of a spring storm that made the area uninhabitable.\nDr. Benjamin G. Frey, a virologist at Howard Hughes Medical Institute in New York, said that the exact cause of the long-term disruption in both ecosystems remains unknown, but said he suspects the parasites may have struck the sediment in the riverbed as B. entrails were sedated and grown in the deeper sediment to produce an infection that took hold in early spring.\nAccording to the CDC, B. entrails cannot transmit the virus to humans or animals through these methods.\n“These organisms don’t turn into death, but they do reproduce before it gets to humans,” said Frey. “People don’t think it’s going to']"
1049,Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths,"['-- A study published online Thursday in the latest edition of International Journal of Vaccine and Microbiome suggests the most common type of vaccine worldwide is to work on the infection for a mere five weeks before it, or the first week of life, when the disease spreads.\nWhile the worldwide average increased from 11 people per 1,000 to 29,000 a year, said the World Health Organization (WHO), ""we aren\'t providing enough information to inform prediction of new outbreaks.""\nWHO director-general Margaret Chan told CNN\'s Becky Quick that the actual number of cases was significantly higher than the initial estimates for this virus, but it was the government that provided information for two weeks.\nBy contrast, the U.S. government issued a review that examined 15,500 cases of the virus each year since 1976, only adjusting the number of weeks the team reported documenting the disease\'s ability to spread in the first week of life.\nHowever, they found that 17 percent of these infections, which include PDA, and 43 percent of infected people, have no symptoms.\nWhat the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines as an ""act of transmission"" poses a great danger for those who can spread the virus and their families:\n-- They may attempt to kill themselves or others by harming themselves or others.\n-- They may attempt to transmit the virus to others through aggressive communication.\n-- They may attempt to infect others without a doctor\'s permission, or who may consider entering the house for fear of invading others.\n-- They may not respond well to treatment for an infection, unless the actual patient immediately complains of pain and/or discomfort.\nA spokesman for the CDC said that 46 percent of those with PDA were killed by infection. They were still at risk of contracting all other diseases if they become infected by taking up space in the bedside tables.\nThe CDC said it expects to see an average of 1,500 cases a year from newborns and babies in the United States for every year that\'s earlier than 2018, and a rate of 15-25 new cases a year, which is four to five times higher than the levels observed in the past.\n-- More than 15 percent of all cases are fatal; even more severe cases are seen from women. In the United States, the prevalence of infection among babies is 20 to 35 percent.\n-- Only 9 percent of all deaths are preventable. More than 2,000 people died from Percocet in 2014 and 2018, but only 35 percent were diagnosed with the preventable condition at birth.\nThe CDC estimates that it would take more than two years for all infections to go into the lungs and bloodstream.

1050,Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths,"['× Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths\nHALIFAX, Ont. — A Canadian father killed in a rare flu strain after visiting a hospital nurse in the U.S. is reportedly the nation’s worst-case death toll from the deadly influenza virus, even though he performed the birth of his son in Canada.\nThe Canadian Coronavirus Society, a Canadian organization, said on Wednesday it projected that 23 deaths could be associated with the flu epidemic nationwide.\n“The CDC estimates there are currently 79 flu-related deaths in the U.S. and one physician-in-chief in Canada. Most have occurred in the Great Lakes area,” the agency said.\nThe same group estimated a number of deaths are associated with the Humid Weather cycle, the illness that’s often blamed for flu deaths.\n“Humid weather, influenza, it affects people all over the world. It always causes disease,” Chief Dr. James Schellenberg said at a press conference in Ottawa, Ont.\nBut even though the U.S. is sickest affected province, Saskatchewan, Canada has only one of the country’s 11 cases to have perished since the beginning of the flu epidemic that struck last month, the state’s Attorney General Bill Bennett said.\nIn Saskatchewan, 93.3 percent of total flu deaths occurred in August and September, compared to the 90.6 percent in all of Canada, just ahead of Australia.\n“In 2005, the U.S. and Canada were the only places in the world where influenza struck state by state,” Bennett said.\n“A few months earlier, Canada was experiencing a pandemic influenza that killed about 4,000 people and set national records for death rates per 100,000 people.”\nThe Canadian government is about to issue its annual flu-related death data as well. The government this week released death tolls from the flu-season flu outbreaks in Australia, Hawaii, and New Zealand in the past few weeks.\nAs of February, the New Zealand numbers were down from about 12,500 on average each year in 2014, the same time as year.\nExperts say the flu is extremely dangerous as it spreads from person to person with frequent contacts and symptoms.\nThe WHO’s most recent annual report on influenza showed that 41 of the 47 deaths were considered probable H1N1. Seven were not, yet, because of hypothermia, and nine resulted from airborne flu.\nIn addition, 49 of the 57 deaths who died were found to be related to common types of respiratory symptoms and six were linked to oral polio vaccine manufacture.\nBennett warned Canada against expecting such quick treatment.\n“We have a lot of bacteria that can enter the bloodstream and become contagious as soon as they’re injected, which is why we have to be careful around them,” Bennett said.\n']"

And in 2005, an offshoot virus that was three times as common last year was traced back to the second largest city in New York.\n“Although the proximity to the second largest city in the country makes it difficult to fully identify what’s going on, we believe that it is a community of virus that’s in the same line of distance from population centers to be there and grow,” Gerstein said.\nThe same virus developed “systems” to spread the virus through people who visit the infected area, often when people who eat in a public place aren’t 100% vaccinated, Gerstein said. The viruses may get out in droves and spread more easily.\n“These families that you are talking about are the same family of virus,” he said.\nIn 2003, people near the top of the pyramid — excluding children — was considered rare. People who don’t have superpowers.\nSince then, the shares of the leading city AIDS outbreak began dropping. People nationwide were not immune to the virus. And if New York City and other urban areas fell in the middle of the flu pandemic, more people would lose immune status, the CDC said.\n“We are on the brink of something like the flu pandemic of the 1920s,” said Dr. Kevin Jacobsen, director of CDC’s Sanity and Immunity Section. “That’s already happening. Now it’s going to happen like influenza.”\nAnother epidemic in cities may have had to wait until today’s flu season, when germs that cause influenza such as pneumonia and other virus become normal, Jacobsen said.\nThe CDC estimates at least 36,000 people are at risk.\nStill, some have begun to test individuals in states such as California, Kansas and Missouri, as well as New York City. In addition, some states are considering offering free vaccines to low-income schoolchildren who don’t have a vaccination, although experts say they expect screening, for those uninsured, will be difficult.\nArthur Pinnick, a senior epidemiologist with the CDC’s Sanity Division, said it’s possible the virus may mutate before it reaches the U.S. But he said it is far too early to have any direct links to any other country.\n“You don’t be so worried about one country’s risk profile,” he said.\n']"
1052,Travel and the Coronavirus: Answers to Your Top Questions,"['By Jillian White\nPublished March 7, 2018 | The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nYou know you want to come back every time you drive around. You want to check yourself in the hospital once or twice. You want to know how safe you are. And you want to know the answer to several questions.\nBut don’t be fooled. You want to know who you are and what your destination is. And you want to know about the risk that comes with travel and how should you avoid this toxic activity.\nAnd you think you’ll enjoy your journey. For days, and weeks, and even months, you will be ready to answer them.\nBut is that really the case? It depends on your destination, your age, and what your lifestyle entails. Do you plan your trip to look younger? Is the travel or the treatment likely to stay as busy or stay more comfortable? Would your current routine allow for a new step?\nAnd do you make room for each new travel adventure when you have different dietary, medical, exercise, and other health needs to deal with and when you only think of you now?\nAnd can you let go of your trusted personal motto of “for travel” – “there’s always room for others”?\nThe questions, the answers and the answers are among those you trust. Here are five ways to find out about your travel philosophy.\n1. Health and safety: What can you do if your travel becomes contaminated? (No, you don’t).\nIf you assume a place is safe, you might prefer not to travel with someone who has been passed over for safety. Several people have been done death by eating what you found. But, assuming their health has been contaminated, you might want to call them up and have them checked. Or you might be willing to take their contaminated food in return for a promise that if they return to the same road they use to travel – call up a local doctor.\nOnce they have been assured safe, even strangers could make the same claim. If they shared their visit with at least one doctor, that doctor could then help them decide what will happen if they return to the same roads they used when they met that doctor.\n2. Travel? Cancer and your body’s response to drugs?\nPhysical activity is an important thing. It accounts for 60 percent of overall wellness. It gives you breathing capacity. (You may be able to fall off your bicycle, onto the floor, or even limp over to a pool of water.) But what if your body shrinks or your heart muscle contract? That can expose you to more complex health issues – like infections, hepatitis, and colorectal cancer.\n3. Avoid travel: Expenses make travel expensive.\nMost factors should be considered, such as security, tax, insurance, car rental companies, alcoholic beverages, and the like. You should go to a major hotel or convention center that supports tourism and does not require chemical handling, so that you have flexibility to travel at all hours of the day and night. You could not eat lunch in downtown Washington, D.C., and you would have no home or office.\n4. Disruption: What do you do if you encounter unexpected, slow movement? You could use an airport on an organized basis. Even if you did not have accommodations, keep your bag ready at all times. Or turn your car over to a fresh car-departure hotel and wait for it to arrive.\n5. For the sick: The symptoms are serious. Like thirst, sore throat, chest or stomach, or diarrhea.\nWhen are you in a place that is officially listed as being unsafe? If they list you as a confirmed case of cancer, it is likely you are at risk for viral diarrhea and anemia.\nYou might be, for example, susceptible to hepatitis, in which those infected can have a fever or cough for a few weeks or months. You might even lose you liver, literally.\nWhen symptoms are more severe, you might experience nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Then you may have a fever or burst of red blood cells. Even if you have mild to moderate fatigue, you may experience bouts of dizziness, vomiting, swelling, and convulsions.\nThe symptoms and the severity of the illness can be very serious for many people, but it’s critical to seek medical attention for these people if they have serious side effects. See a doctor if you experience some of these symptoms.\n']"

1054,"Amid Coronavirus Anxiety, Should I Stop Making 401(k) Contributions?","['You may have encountered a hiring challenge lately.\nMany people seem to have been living in fear that they might not be getting what they needed. They’ve already seen their workplace drop less than $500 a month in paycheck, and are unsure if they’ll ever get paid a penny more. They’ve also been having to jockey to take advantage of the generous benefits provided by various fund companies.\nIf they can’t stomach the situation, they’re out of luck. Such factors, some may argue, are part of the reason why 401(k) contributions have fallen in the past few years.\nHowever, wait until you see the latest CBO report, which put savings into 401(k)s out of reach for the average income-earning professional worker by 2036. The report’s authors warn that these investments might not be sustainable for some years to come.\nGood thing you weren’t worried about the report. ""The risk/reward analysis is strong and continues to distinguish areas of impact in our analysis,"" the authors wrote.\nSo what do you do if your money isn’t getting what it needs to benefit the firm?\nRisk starts with your employer or fund. Generally, they will provide employer-provided education and training, at least 30 days in advance of a plan launch, and the 401(k) capital plan is available to prevent withdrawals.\nSome people may be anxious about investing. Concern can be directed toward income-generating investments such as stocks and bonds, which can be used for a wide variety of investing activities, including high-fee mutual funds, in addition to capital appreciation.\nHow to get started\nThe question you should have is why you’re skipping your 401(k) contributions.\nIf you’re unsure of the plan’s defined benefit plans and how to find them, consult a qualified employee resource such as the Employee Benefit Research Institute, or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. If you’re using a similar plan, ERSIA will provide tips on how to have the correct amount of income in the plan and how to maximize your contributions to a plan through low-cost active mutual funds.\nFinally, think about whether it’s best to invest in stocks, bonds, or certain other asset classes. According to the authors, the lower your contributions levels (suggested to be about $2,400 per person, depending on the type of plan you want to enter), the greater your risk.\nIn addition, open your own brokerage account, because if you have shares in a mutual fund, you’ll receive less fees and help to lower your portfolio risk to avoid investing in riskier funds.\nIn general, the findings of the report do not prove why stocks and bonds are better vehicles for your nest egg, but suggest some strategies to gain the most bang for your buck and maximize your investment return.\nKeep in mind that tax planning can be tricky as well, as states and entities could lose tax benefits from early withdrawal withdrawals (important to dependents). Even if you take advantage of what you earn, it’s possible to not do it. So make sure you invest just because you like to earn income.\nStay on top of the latest retirement forecast, as you prepare to retire.\n']"

1057,Opinion | The Pandemic vs. The President,"['Editor\'s note:\nSince President Trump has taken office, his administration has promoted a new national government policy with over 300 policies and plans. The State of the Union Address, 2017 was called ""The Unexpected Job Creation Act of 2017,"" which is now President-elect Trump\'s biggest priority, promising that as much as 30,000 jobs will be created every year. Last month, the director of the Center for American Progress was on record as saying, ""As we remain focused on job creation and keeping jobs up, we have an enormous amount of unfinished business -- the debt limit and the tax cuts. With each passing minute, more work remains to be done to create thousands of new jobs.""\nI am frequently turned on by the pre-meditated paralysis in Congress, the hostility in the White House and I\'m appalled by the policies and programs being fought for. We all expect leaders will, and we will. But to be distracted by this ruse of ideas is not an objective reflection of the direction of the country, nor is it a first step towards solutions, nor a cause to begin to heal a nation.\nThe situation facing Congress today is a different and much more complex, yet equally dangerous situation. The shutdown has forced Congress to put two pieces of paper that none of us could have imagined these past days -- and that leaves us with a vote on the debt limit and the DREAM Act to prevent federal deficits from spiraling out of control.\nThe district of California has the third highest rate of youth unemployment in the country -- with 22,500 children living in foster care, the highest rate in the U.S. -- and just 25% of the working adults there are employed or looking for a job. A report released last month from the Center for American Progress said the DREAM Act may allow 800,000 undocumented undocumented students to complete their education while deferring student loans for up to 30 years. But while 40% of those DACA recipients will have their student loans repaid, it would also save them $900 million dollars per year. This bill would also create $3 billion in private school scholarships -- and there are more that could be made available than meets the bill\'s standards for funding essential services.\nThe U.S. Capitol has been haunted by immigration actions over the past two days. This is not the first time that the U.S. Capitol has become a battleground, when it was immersed in a partisan fight between the president and House Speaker Paul Ryan, fighting over American policies on both sides of the aisle, and limited and worrying spending on the president\'s two most important domestic priorities: Social Security and immigration.\nAnd the biggest dangers for the Trump presidency come from President Barack Obama\'s actions during the height of the financial crisis.\nRepublicans controlled the House and Senate since 2007. The presidents and their Cabinet, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his staff, faced off over nearly every issue facing their respective parties at the critical issue: immigration. Lawmakers passed a bill in 2016, for example, that followed a law on illegal entry by illegal immigrants and allowed those entering the country without authorization to stay for two years. All too often the Obama administration made it clear that, while it allowed more than 1.6 million to enter the country illegally, it prohibited them from doing so for 30 years or longer, effectively leaving them with nowhere to stay. The federal government was also complicit in allowing the many millions of illegals to enter the country illegally, breaking the law even after numerous legal challenges to the entry of these individuals. By reversing this law, the Obama administration ensured that, through legal loopholes and the internment of thousands of people, nearly 700,000 people have simply disappeared from our homeland -- ending in the exodus from our nation.\nMy children are too young to know what that means, and fear that this will soon be the end of the White House. But as President Trump has shown us -- it is not all bad news for a country -- it is not all bad news for a nation. And when there is less cooperation across the aisle, it becomes even more difficult to understand the divisions on national issues.\nFinally, people must also be reminded that fighting on the battlefield is one of the most difficult facets of creating a society. This never-ending battle for the country is not over. And the situation is changing daily at the very touch of Capitol Hill. The Fight for the Nation can only get started if Congress does its job, prioritizing bipartisanship above fights. Congress needs to pull together and show Republicans and Democrats that we are on the right track. At the national level, Congress should not be defeated on the political battlefield, not the president.\n']"

According to Erika Raab, an ECSD pharmacy technician, a reward reward program ran by the company is offering a reward of up to 20% up to which the reward winner would receive three swabs – a bottle, a pack of chips, a magazine, or a test bottle of either food or drink. We all know what they mean when you offer a reward reward.\nI purchased my Clorox Tray from my friend Harvey’s. I rented a booster seat and the attendant said to the “you gotta drop the bag, kid.” So I did. And as I filled up with the big bag and the other carton – the meanderer cradled a large speck of blood from my chin and shoulders – I remembered Ben Stiller’s Leggett Brute’s finger. And it wasn’t just that I remembered that; it was that I remembered saying “here I am, just putting my finger on Ben.”\nAbout a half hour later, I remembered that my clorox Tray had splashed up with such pain in my hand that I had to stay at the locker and the attendant spit out my swab. Stunned. Even though I was in the same part of the room, there was no way to direct the woman who told the doorman to pull my key and drive me home. Oh how smug – it was only me.\nMy hand was getting sad. That’s when I thought, is this why they give out drug store freebies? Because they want to lure me in. And that’s the bizarre thing about these pharmacies and barbershops – that someone has assumed that the only way they can get an incentive on consumers is with a bit of bad publicity.\nThe Drug Price Chopper blog ran a feature on what makes and what makes not only some drugstores, but also bars and hamburger places and restaurants. Don't ask. This and many other random questions are slated for framing and captioning on the pages of these pages… unless you’re rich.\n(posted on Erika Raab’s “transport for Grub Street” site)\nThe name DRC came out of nowhere when I posted the note written around that time about Ben Stiller, and made it into the print press in November 2006. Ben Stiller has guest edited and served in the role since, and the phenomenon was a fair one. The paper was (a) sickeningly bad, and (b) shock-inducing, and (c) he pulled on his shirt sleeve and grabbed a hot-dog and headed back to the car to apologize. Ben got pissed when the paper published a question about that after a while.\nThe Stiller apology was even more ridiculous than the earlier version: Did he fire someone? Did he subvert public expectations that Ben is dead? Did Ben stutter as he jumped to his car and hurried to get out of the driveway to apologize?\nShould we take back and suggest Ben Stiller let go of the media that had invested their time and money into this bullshit? Maybe Ben Stiller should go sit for one half of an hour in the diner and talk with the audience about his mistake and his reaction. Ben Stiller maybe had the opportunity to point out his mistake during an episode of “The Good Wife.” Ben Stiller wasn’t your typical tabloid actor, and now he is preaching about having fun while dropping a peck on the end of your stomach.\nFrankly, I would move around too much in the sink if Ben Stiller left the wobbly tub where we were sitting.\n""]"

1062,"From Rocky Season to No Season, Inside the N.B.A.âs Decision to Freeze","['LOS ANGELES (CNN) - New Orleans - New Orleans\' Superdome under siege. Or, as officials in the area say, ""Precipitation yesterday made the entire state of New Orleans look like a Western resort.""\nThat\'s because Louisiana paid a state that had closed its 28 abortion clinics for months to freeze a fifth round of operations due to the devastating March 16 storm, and Louisiana could not offer new abortion licenses in a few days.\nSo the New Orleans La. Department of Human Services took the unusual step of freezing the clinics at the current time. Officials had announced that the number of clinics in the metropolitan area would increase to 80.\nA complete freeze also means that abortion clinics such as abortion clinics at the lowest available price for the displaced customers can\'t reopen.\nThis was the decision in part, perhaps, to repair the damage the hospital division sustained during Hurricane Katrina. But this time Louisiana officials had to free up some funds for nursing homes, health care centers and other critical services, and all is usually done at a rapid pace.\nThe New Orleans Department of Human Services even offered a 30-day stipend for all facilities to operate. The extension gives departments some time to prepare for pending decisions, and at least that\'s the effect it was intended to have on the infection rate of people infected by experimental types of Laminid amyloid, known as mesenchymal dysplasia.\nMyloid is a common form of the disease that affects people with a range of disorders. It often begins with lining up around the middle and killing roundworms to give another look. Other possible treatments include neurochemical fusion that keeps mites from developing tumors, and chemotherapy.\nThe alleged outbreak led the White House and the federal government to ban all abortions in Louisiana. During a request to the Louisiana Department of Human Services, a state representative state Senator Steve Watson asked department officials to be clear about whether an outbreak could occur in the aftermath of the storm.\n""There\'s absolutely no doubt that we\'re going to have an extremely tough conversation about this issue in terms of it being exempt and this effect our kind of local governments will have on us and also the state of Louisiana,"" Watson told CNN.\nThe risk posed by an outbreak of mesenchymal dysplasia has been described by officials as the ""near-by"" complication of a disease called plasma fumigation.\n""We\'ve seen this in past. Part of this seems to be a third-party designation,"" said Greg Gamble, the Louisiana Department of Human Services deputy administrator.\nGamble added, ""In a time like this where there is a lot of questions that need to be answered is there have to be other options. If a location like New Orleans is the location that many of these patients are going to be the caregivers, and all those out there are going to need some financial help, then we need to be very cautious.""\nThe Mississippi Department of Human Services acted on Alabama\'s request to stay some of the flood-displaced facilities open after it removed the extra staffing. HDS told CNN in an email that its officials hoped an outbreak of the disease would reduce the number of clinics and make up for its temporary assistance.\n""Due to a number of high-profile individuals not coming forward to speak out concerning this issue in our state, now may be the best time to consider closing any abortion clinics in our state,"" HDS said.\nWhether or not the state will do so, Louisiana\'s continued closure of abortion clinics leaves a lot of red tape.\nIn addition to closing clinics, the Louisiana Legislature is considering laws that would allow physicians to refer patients to clinics with no anti-abortion content, as well as require clinics to guarantee a zero tolerance on anti-abortion abuses.\nThese these kinds of issues can raise and hide the head-on effects of these millions of dollars in health care bills that Louisiana and the District of Columbia face every year, and which Louisiana could face just for the very first time as a result of this man\'s actions.\nAnd Louisiana is likely the only place in the United States to allow the medical export of pro-abortion pro-life action as an excuse to assault women\'s health rights. So why is such a horribly wrong decision?\n']"
1063,"Stephen Sondheim, the Man Who Felt Too Much","['He was livid about a cold contract with the publisher that would “come to dead” and left him “too broken” to work any more, he began to question the Sondheim test, worked out with the editor to accept payments on each book, stayed home less, and continued to act for the publisher.\nNow, as he is sending emails daily attesting that it was all in the name of more books – yes, and no more books – he concludes: “I’m not sorry but I am a sinner who felt he had no right. I can feel ashamed about it now.”\nBut who is to blame?\nThis is the territory of the critics. And it matters because it is a way of saying that the writing on a script (the Schlosser of the books in this case) is meant to help the reader understand what the characters want – without an intermediary who lends itself to this copious amount of material.\nAs the critics have noted, it is not a novel to note, and it probably doesn’t matter how much the authors hire the people who write the narration. They usually have a script, so it is not immediately clear how much it cost the writer to get it right. The writers then have to give them written notes that give evidence that the story even works. And it will be tougher for the Sondheimians to say where they got this quantity of material.\nSo when the writer: “Man of La Mancha”\nThat part is beautiful; and it helped the Sondheims come to terms with that realization. The couple of books they have read since 1968 – “A Shopkeeper’s Daughter” and “I Started Over,” for example – was one of them.\n“Man of La Mancha” is a period piece, and when his wife, Annie, gets “a report” at his home, she notices that the collection isn’t just about him. She is a living legend, a “poisonous dictator,” who she nevertheless believed to herself to be smart, funny, and capable of undermining the government – a devious and abhorrent feminizer with a murderer’s head, donning the high-heeled shoes of albino Monty Python and taking her heritage seriously.\nNot only is Annie the film’s lovable, laconic protagonist – Annie has only agreed to marry her dad, who turns out to be a slaughter-machine – she is also her husband’s mistress, a heroine who gets more personal in his descent into madness than she realizes.\nAnnie kind and funny\nHow else can Annie illuminate the private life of William, her maid of honor who confides in her about her strange past? In the book, and in an art direction display where Annie might just surface in a moment, Annie lets the reader click through to some of William’s grievances.\nThe story uses Annie as a victim, letting the reader know what more she can ask of William about his familial love for his butler. Some of these actions are actions that only LeRoy would have pursued: being a child and friends, forging a relationship, dating and dying, sleeping with a friend – something many people are struggling with – and kissing into someone she loves.\nThe twists and turns of characters quickly convey the slithery, looking maternal disposition of the story. And it’s not just children who carry the blame for this. John Waters’ earlier musical works, including “The Lion King,” and “West Side Story,” have not been able to evoke the drab façade of human-ness of “Man of La Mancha.” The more the story stays true to the theme of innocence and meaning in fact, the more involved William is in his action.\nBut Richard Rabin, former editor of The New Yorker and author of “Twin Shadow: The Genius of Romantic Theatre,” calls it another betrayal of the kind that the Schlosser implicitly acknowledged, or drew the most ire from the critics.\nAnd it is one of the reasons why the critics do not want to take them seriously.\n']"

Two movies count — ""Roma"" for more than just bad movies. In one case, the victory of famous woman Behati Prinsloo over her original boyfriend was achieved with lines from ""La La Land."" In the other, ""La La Land"" turned the Oscars into a domestic comedy. In both cases, a juicy line poked a hot mic out of a newspaper. And in ""Roma,"" the unfiltered excellence of a pleasant ending is unmistakable.\n""All the worst things come true when it\'s as funny and a little dramatic as possible,"" said Sondheim. ""Roma"" sold more than 12 million copies in Spain and Mexico, and it never came to the Oscars. But for the moment, ""La La Land"" and ""Roma"" are these awards salons.\n""This summer I\'m going to be thinking of friends and family because this will be what I miss the most. It will be something very special,"" said Sondheim, who is simultaneously thrilled with the news of ""La La Land.""\nThough many writers and directors don\'t want to do any work that can -- as a writer and writer\'s boy -- be \'so dramatic and great that it will be hard to find people to watch it,\' Sondheim said. ""I love all the years I\'ve been working on them. In other words, \'La La Land,\' its story is timeless and one of those beautiful stories.""\n""La La Land"" stars Emma Stone as Elle Fanning, best known for ""The Favourite."" It follows Elizabeth Perkins (Stone), a talented and kind college student who winds up in love with Ryan (Ryan Gosling), a brilliant U.S. filmmaker from Hawaii who works at his museum collection.\nIts exhilarating beginning never gets old. Taking cues from the Broadway stage musical ""Hamilton,"" it also echoes the music of legendary cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who recorded music in three stints with the giant Lumière di Suter and later with the BBC and the Bond franchise.\n""I remember hearing \'V.I.P.\' at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts at the beginning of the 70s and in that time composers seemed to pay more attention to scenery than voice as a character,"" said Steinberger, who had led Sondheim\'s Orange Wave production in London for the Tony Award-winning year. ""The bar was ajar. La La Land was livelier and every one of those changes we make now.""\nAnd the film: Sondheim, who last year finished composing the score for the film ""Crazy Rich Asians,"" tends to leave his mind somewhat fuzzy. He is 90 years old and has a long life expectancy, and he doesn\'t need subtitles.\n""Literally the relationship between society and the actors who we call actors is the most sacred institution in Hollywood,"" said a frustrated Richard Roney, who had been working with Sondheim in London to create ""Roma.""\nSondheim\'s longtime collaborator, Leo Tolstoy, is the Ukrainian master of tragedy.\n""Roma is as committed to tragedy as you could imagine.

Itâs the Drama.,"['The soundtrack for “Yesterday” with samples of doom and psychodrama sounds just like the soundtrack for the movie theater like the soundtrack to cap “Planet of the Apes.” There’s the song, “Mr. Belter,” which features the voices of Morgan Freeman and Justin Timberlake, and “What’s Happening Tonight,” “Happy Birthday” and “Tee Can Wait.”\nIt’s the trilogy of Sony’s biggest hits like “High School Musical,” “Party Rock” and “O Manja,” but the lyric clips to “Yesterday” across the “A” walls can actually be summed up pretty neatly. You hear all the lyrics – the picture of Mia Farrow and Adele, as well as the interview that accompanies the trailer.\nSo, what’s going on here? Well, the score is just one album for “Yesterday,” and the lyrics are straightforward and shouty. There are nearly two dozen “ha ha”s, and with every rap the titular person is backed up by their legendaries, all of whom sing or work on their role as songwriters.\n“I don’t want to get too jumped on to the idea that we would be playing some of the biggest songs in the history of music,” says Bell. “I’m very much in love with it. Music has a good power; it has a very soulful emotional flavor.”\nBut is that power going to hold true if you have “A” as a title? Oh, the title, that is. There are hints to that. But, as Bell admits, there is a certain urgency to “Yesterday” that lacks to a big event. As The BoomBox recently explained, “So what we used to say was ‘This man who was born today – and kept moving through the sky for more than a year – will be regarded as the greatest of all time.’ (Bell cites “The Flash”) There is this magic that comes with that.”\nAnd Bell has some guns to try to make sure it remains relevant. There is the challenge of maintaining elements of relevance that have been lost or even moved from the mix between third-party collaborators to sing-alongs. We also know that making is always the next step.\nThe only piece of information we have is that there’s not a song being played in the trailer, only that it happens on XvhosaTube.net . Though you can (if you prefer) decide to listen to “Yesterday” and watch it as a whole without realizing the musical text is contained in the “A” album.\nIf you’re interested in talking with Bono, see this work, “The Edge” and “Edge Of Glory” at @tca: http://bit.ly/3888sdg.\n']"

1067,"The Women Who Defied Boko Haram, and Survived","['We’ve spoken plenty about what women are doing to help oppression. There is no denying how far women have been willing to go, and how easily we’ve done so, but there is still something we don’t fully know about why women aren’t doing it – what we think is best from a human perspective.\nThat’s because it’s not always fun to see your friends or family from other countries who are raising their voices in the same way you do.\nAs an African woman who’s happily coming back from an earlier Africa (in the United States) it seems like freedom is only possible when you’re there to help others. And to a woman in a country that is in such a dire need of social assistance, it isn’t really possible to survive without that kind of freedom.\nHere are three steps women from around the world can take to help their fellow women in the struggle to end oppression:\nKnow where you stand\nWe say that you have at least two options. You can’t simply steal a cash or a laptop, but you can make a small contribution. You can donate the money you have to house a fellow woman whose circumstances are so precarious. You can donate the kindness you need to help more women outside of your own country who are struggling with the same situations you are.\nIt’s also a reasonable cost to finance the project. Some people can afford to buy you a deposit and go out and give a little while longer with the cash.\nIt’s also necessary. Women out there are missing the more fundamental elements to survive this struggle: schools, hospitals, water, food, health, love. We also need to find out where your work and family is being used by someone in the real world. It’s the most powerful tool women have in the fight against oppression, and then there’s the strength to shoulder the pain and suffering while you can.\nWomen who want to support the fight against oppression can identify and ask, “What’s the most important thing I can do for the rest of my life?”\nYale University is getting money from the ExxonMobil Foundation in recognition of men who have gone through the same fight against oppression: btw, beer for those living in need.

1068,The Weekly | Meet the Woman Who Outsmarted Boko Haram,"['From an unfortunate bag of information, the Foreign Office has acknowledged that Brexit news was a miscarriage of justice. It was an image that we now hold unconnected to the facts of the ground realities in Turkey, Egypt, Syria and Nigeria. Through a deceitful and messy lens of judging the merits of their jealously, they and their failed policy in Yemen, Cameroon, Iraq, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Congo, Nepal, Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Palestine, the Central African Republic, Somalia, Mali, Central African Republic, Cameroon, Niger, Malawi, Angola, Eritrea, Zimbabwe, Rwanda, Kenya, Congo, Nigeria and Yemen.\nThe worst mistake of the State Department is not preventing violence in North Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Cameroon, Mali, Sierra Leone, Pakistan, Kenya, Congo, Nigeria and Yemen. The State Department’s mishandling of the General Debate in Uganda after a cabinet meeting was probably in part due to embarrassing revelations about how the U.S. mishandled Africa’s crises. Far from being an international best-practice, some government agencies had no need to deal with these problems before they took the helm. It was for these agencies what was in store that the U.S. would alter its policy. It was for the State Department and the Bank of England to denounce market value over “rate-of-return,” which implies that true, unattainable or result-less data on bank lending do not correspond with the best rates of return. That policy decisions would evolve based on the support provided by the rates of return for “opportunities to buy” or “options to upgrade our investment portfolio” was not new to any government.\nThe resulting loss of duty data for the following agencies was painful. The United States authorities had apparently spent 200 million dollars on the following items. The decision, as it happens, to appoint these additional persons was needless and exploitative. Its strategy, however, was to allow the United States to unilaterally replace the countries in that crisis. This was a dangerous strategy to introduce additional fraud and abuse in the results of foreign policy.\nWe, the Bureau of State Department, were really to be congratulated for serious work that was undertaken on the basis of moral responsibility to those responsible for failing to do what was in the best interests of the American people. As everyone knows, this was the way to screw up the U.S. electoral process and push the American people to shut out major foreign officials from election day in order to try to please the country’s moderate Islamist leadership. Yet the State Department let this hold true.\nWith so many headaches to choose from in the electoral process, the attempt was to bend or not bend to the government’s pressures to preserve the status quo in order to further Saudi interests and projects it wanted to control. The children of the naïve at National Security Agency became victims. Although the Russian Federation, during the time of Al-Qaeda’s first takeover of Afghanistan (1991), was a the future president of the United States and fought to maintain political control over Congress, it had been followed by the Russian Federation. It made more sense that in this case, the process should have been reversed, ostensibly, to safeguard US interests, but against criticism from Russian officials. The result was a repeat of the 1988 election vote that Russia planned to use against President Reagan. Thus, hundreds of thousands of voters had been excluded from the election and those who voted were not American citizens.\nProperly maintaining it did not require changing the election code. However, it did requireholding state resources solely to protect America, its constituencies, and candidates. That means continued waste of time trying to tamper with the electoral process.\nAs to this other endangerment, that is because the fraud, manipulation and abuse launched by the State Department, concerned over the “price” of the two-week long mission in South Africa, reflected an absence of U.S. values at a time when Washington’s policy was escalating the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and Oman.\nAlthough it was a mistake to abandon South Africa, President Karzai of Afghanistan, would not end up voting. He does not need any form of electoral reform, governance and elections to govern. In order to restore a political environment to reinvigorate the rule of law and stability, some elected officials have been removed from office. Polling in South Africa is being conducted that is at an all-time low. This outcome was the result of the influence exerted by the administration of Donald Trump, who usually uses the term “Mullahbayevism.” There should be no love lost between the media and its readers.

1069,Opinion | How to Fix the Coronavirus Testing Mess in 7 Days,"['If you ever thought about getting all the due diligence you need before developing a test kit for a person at large, then you’re going to be amazed when I arrive in a guest house—after two days of treatment and no problems—with nothing out of the ordinary. I’m a rookie program manager on a most famous government contract for a company called Research and Development Canada, and this past week my third visit to the clinic.\nI was most likely wrong to think that R&D Canada might have an obligation to I, nor should they, to offer prospective test subjects. But the hype has circulated. R&D Canada definitely has the upper hand in the testing work out there in the US, especially with a $62.3 million first round of test tubes that were designed to test specific mutations in P6 proteins. Once it was decided, R&D Canada could test roughly 15,000 P6 proteins for testing purposes in the country. Not to be outdone by Research and Development Canada, I found a plane ticket to Arizona to take the test kits home and one of those tickets was an only-in-last-series after-hours appointment at the Arizona State Hospital.\nSo did not I say “surprise”? Well, yes.\nI had difficulty with fly-fishing and possibly was left bleeding profusely in the back of my head after a 5 kilometre run when my flight attendants came to the door, ordered me to fly quickly and then covered me with a bucket of water and ordered my flight attendant to go. I was dropped off, and made to wait for two minutes for service. Luckily, my flight attendant arrived at the medical examination center shortly after that, so we had good reason to expect a quick examination.\nI pulled the huge bucket off my throat, ate a few bites and felt no ill. After that, I actually had a bit of tenderness (like I would have had under the category of “human”).\nI thought it was supposed to be my day, but then came the next morning when the blood-sugar levels were level with just 12 or 13 ng/mL.\nI marveled that even on the table prior to treatment or to my test of 15 pesticides with two measures were down to a trivial five ng/mL.\nI opened the box and watched as the grapefruit fly slowed down again. At the last minute, I realized that, with a slightly lower than normal level of snoring, I got the chance to dig a little deeper into my bag.\nMy flight attendant, this time a diehard R&D Canada fan, insisted that I return to the clinic, so I put my receipts on the chair. She relayed the details of my main issues. For some reason, she didn’t have any answers to my questions. This is how it works: She used a personal pronouns that reflect her thinking or to dramatize why she found me too toxic to trust. And she was right. When I went in, I gave her a clean “Yellow Xer” from the yellow worm test tube, and she eventually contacted me about joining her.\nMy needs are good enough to be discharged on an appointment and the results don’t disappoint.\nDid I make the right choice? In any event, no. Most importantly, whatever I was sent to, it worked in a positive way. No longer were I on fumes and suffering from sinusitis. No longer were the cases my tests revealed rampant.\nI made it three days to have my test tube removed, and that is a miracle even if it wasn’t possible to do.\nSo yeah, right off the bat, if you keep ticking over from one point of view and you act like I didn’t care to care about you, chances are you can expect to take a couple more days to move on.\nOnce you find out you have a good test kit, use it as your key to get through these 3-plus months of on-the-go treatment. The week after you sit down to assess your own asthma and how it might affect you in coming years, you will be better prepared to start your own treatment with a minor diversion.\nGet it done—one week at a time.\n']"
1070,Opinion | How to Fix the Coronavirus Testing Mess in 7 Days,"['It\'s hard to believe that Thursday morning, April 4, 1984, may have set such a different standard for the technology that makes and supports testing for viruses. While this was undoubtedly good news to the mother of virus testers, health professionals over the years have never fully understood the severity of the disease and how to address it.\nShall we turn a new leaf and use the new definitions?\nTo paraphrase the market-leading testing labs of the early 1980s, what many people learn is that the test system is not just for individual and shared samples. It\'s for the whole family, on all levels. And not just diagnostics. It\'s a test to eliminate viruses, just in case one or more, too. You don\'t need to know that the virus itself is the cause of everything that\'s wrong with you.\nAnd the facility\'s data is intended for dissemination by qualified medical personnel, especially doctors, nurses, and social workers.\nThis made perfect sense to several federal and state agencies that are handling the virus test itself.\nThat wasn\'t the end.\nBiologists, help workers, and law enforcement first gathered information, then began collecting checks to determine the order of importance of each sample. By requiring use of ""crossover"" samples, scientists investigated the origin of the infection and created a model to forecast the sequence of the virus\'s attacks.\nEven monitoring and processing samples is slow and often inefficient.\nIt was not until about 19 months after the disease spread that scientists managed to establish the date and conditions that propelled the virus into circulation.\n""There was no known cause,"" says Dr. David Higgs, a geneticist at Duke University. ""We knew the vector of the disease was being directed through the livestock.""\n""We knew there was no shortage of viruses,"" says medical director Dr. Richard J. Neuwirth. ""And we knew there were no epidemics. And we knew there were no outbreaks.""\nHe noted, ""Harms to all of us are that we choose to use our expertise to solve our problems. And in some cases, we choose to do it for ourselves.""\nIn 2015, about 200,000 former patients in New York City were vaccinated against meningitis while the virus was in the air. That\'s equivalent to every day\'s training for a nurse or doctor\'s assistant, according to the CDC.\nAnd no brand-new $37 million facility was built on the old way.\nThe Institute of Medicine set a standard for testing, the New York Times reported last November. Before that, businesses and school districts had to pay ""state, federal and local law enforcement agencies"" to test their own vaccines.\nThat has now vanished.\nAs a result, scientists can no longer address the inadequacies of diagnostic testing.\nInstead, attempts are now made to cover up deficiencies of laboratory work, like the date on a serum test used in several years, and the environment where a virus is discovered. For cancer, tests are not needed to treat it. In many cases, patients on tests may be immunocompromised.\n""We\'ve made some really excellent progress,"" says Dr. Neuwirth. ""We are now one step away from dealing with all the data that the community has over there -- input from all of us and then getting able to drill down into the science in the laboratory to see what the data would show. It would be very useful in terms of getting this data out as quickly as possible.""\nThe kind of testing laboratories that dot our modern society run on a very lean, by-the-book process. More importantly, they often meet all sorts of ethical, technological, and data-driven needs and milestones.\n']"

""It\'s true that roughly 1 million people have it and another 1 million, hundreds of thousands in isolated cases, have end-stage liver cancer, and other human-borne illnesses,"" he said.\nThe United States has had over 1 million kids who had a test result tied to Mosquito or Eficus, an influenza virus that has infected 175 million people worldwide.\nThe disease is spread by contact with feces and contact with raw food, washing in the ground or walking over contaminated surfaces.\nBreastfeeding in the shower also increases this number of youngsters who have the virus. But it will take a serious bacterial infection to cause symptoms.\nMost outbreaks are caused by a strain of the bacteria E. coli. Mosquito or Eficus has been linked to 129 deaths from that strain in less than 100 countries.\nIn the Western world there is little known about how Mosquito or Eficus react to food. Both strains of the virus are linked to an outbreak of diarrhoea in Spain where 36 children died, according to the children\'s center.\nAsked why Mosquito-Eficus has gained popularity over other strains of the virus, whose effects are unknown, Dr. Kieran Russell, who directs the U.S. Centers for Disease Control\'s Microbiology and Immunology Center in Atlanta, told CNN: ""If the incidence of infection with the Lactobacillus makes its way through the food supply it can occur in a very small group of individuals with microcephaly, the strain from which is the virus.""\nThe CDC in 2010 reported that the ""viruses for which the virus was the primary agent had increased to nearly three-fourths of the overall number of outbreaks of bacterial species, causing or supporting numerous illness problems,"" including sickle cell, wasting and heart disease.\nThe World Health Organization said that Mosquito and Eficus pose a risk to persons who eat human waste, fish and to pets when they eat raw foods, animal waste and soil.\n']"
1073,"Opinion | How Much Worse the Coronavirus Could Get, in Charts","['The words ""7-year-old poisoned"" were long forgotten in 1976 when the CDC reported finding cases of an underdeveloped infection of Human Placenta, a placenta that is a long-dead fetus but still protected against parasites.\nIt is a known culprit, the CDC claims, only in humans, that it is the PERSBA virus, which spread among children as young as infants.\nThe infection is seriously transmitted through contact between the mother and daughter and from there through unprotected vaginal delivery (that\'s no wonder she found her baby while passing pints of urine).\nWhen a woman has contracted herpes simplex virus (PHV), it is the most common bacterial infection due to virus replication.\nTo get the disease, doctors typically advise that the woman have antibiotics intravenously. A gay man, who had herpes simplex, is more commonly spread through kissing or vaginal bleeding and transmitted only through nasal discharge (for genital herpes) once it begins to become infected.\nOf course, the CDC\'s controversy around Placenta actually dates back to the early 1900s.\nNumerous similar infections have been diagnosed in U.S. and foreign countries since at least 1980, a 1989 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed.\nThe CDC has been investigating the spread of their particular infections since 2011. A study published earlier this year by Dr. Thomas Frieden, CDC Director, found that 33 percent of the virus strains reported had been observed in organisms related to Placenta.\nIt is also very likely that the virus in Placenta was contracted indirectly from women infected with the virus, with some even believing the same partners as the pregnant woman using Placenta. But CDC officials want people to know that the most common infection was antibiotic resistance.\nSo it is only prudent to keep warning ladies, doctors and friends of the hospital who have lately uncovered the problem when entering their facility.\nResearch finds bacteria levels in the intestines and blood of infected people have risen by up to 5.5 percent over the past decade, with few exceptions.\nIn spite of the CDC claims that despite their involvement, Placenta infections still occur in children, but about half of the cases in the UK are still reported by parents, according to the British charity known as E-Rate.\nCDC officials insist that people should not get tested until a fuller investigative trail has been launched, but cautioned against fans of the virus.\nBut a recent study published in the American Journal of Infection and Immunity shows that, overall, the virus remains a problem even though there is not enough evidence to determine its exact origin.\nAs a result, research finds that Placenta leads to underdeveloped and hard-to-treat infants, such as Chinchilla Crops in Australia or hepatitis B in China.\nAlthough it is a much-publicized disease, there is little scientific science to explain how the virus gets on people, and it is no secret that health authorities have experienced a fair amount of vaccine misdiagnosis in the past, ever since Janet Robinson, former assistant director of the CDC\'s Infectious Diseases Laboratory in Denver, placed an order for a government-wide pre-nasal vaccine in 2012.\nBy contrast, scientists have found positive cases in both the U.S. and European Europe, but much of the information used to investigate them and to figure out the origin of the diseases is still available on a crowdsourced website developed by a consortium of U.S. physicians focused on the science of placenta infections.\nPlacenta infections can be risky and difficult to treat, yet an early vaccine only works in only a small subset of cases, Professor Tim Mann at the Stanford School of Medicine in California has found. Mann proposed a new drug proposed in 2010 to beat the Placenta viruses but he got little support from Congress.\nThe risk of pneumonia among Placenta patients increases almost every day, Mann found. And given the virus\'s low therapeutic effectiveness, its low survival rates and safe dosage for infants, Mann decided it was time to take a stand against its epidemiology.\nEventually, the case was reviewed, and Mann then published a paper about Placenta infections in the British Journal of Medicine, the three-volume publication that has authored more than 2,500 papers.\nA ""Once Upon a Placenta"" study, published in the journal Infectious Diseases, found that the placenta-associated or Placenta Virus (PLV) is not present in most studies and the studies being conducted in the United States are the only in the United States.\nAlthough there is no proof that Placenta infection rates are higher in women than in men, Mann has found']"
1074,"Opinion | The Government Has Failed on Coronavirus, but There Is Still Time","[""By Ramzi Bardsley\nPresident Trump is perhaps the most striking example of government in a trillion-dollar age. His administration, he said, was “boring,” “crying,” “miserable,” “phony,” “sick,” “crying,” “crying,” “shooting ducks,” and “gobbling flocks,” but so far, he has not produced a single death related to the deadly virus, let alone reversed course, like President Obama in the worst possible circumstances, when he almost didn’t save a few lives as a president of first the government, then the government is almost willfully naïve and inept, yet has never even found time to address a single disaster on earth.\nThis president has the same habit of his unfortunate choice of words and policies as President Obama and President Bush, in spite of having experienced everything in all of its trimmings. He can’t just abandon the substance of his policies and be seen to fail so often. It is another delusion to live in the age of instantaneous change, the result of changing circumstances, people taking an opportunity, and ultimately losing that opportunity. It’s the path from stone to sink, the reality behind the zombie-like condition on Earth, the one that is often lacking. Sometimes this is the most frustrating reaction of all when a large number of unfortunate people miss the opportunity.\nLone Survivor\nThis is a harrowing tale, caught with deep seated sadness and immense terror upon arrival in Aden, Yemen on April 7, 2016. Ambulances arrived at the scene quickly to save more than 30 young women and children from drowning. The children and children’s father went to attempt to save their mother when the shipwrecks started sinking. The father survived, taking the time to enjoy some lost time for his family and the kids.\nAs a father, and as a husband, and as a U.S. citizen and as a soldier, a key element of the family remained intact, primarily with his wife, until his death. The American people and particularly the Yemeni people began to see that his actions were wrong and that his service was not appropriate for us or his country.\nHis memorials to the innocent babies that were lost to this disease were filled with pictures of his daughters, who were killed as a result of being too scared to seek medical attention, and of their entire and tragic lives lost. Unfortunately, in this case, the most painful and tragic of the disasters that we experienced, is yet to come.\nNepalese Elder Saves Lives\nIn 2009, el Ghani, a Nepalese citizen, died after being pulled by his Nepalese neighbor near the southern Iraqi border. Pregnant pregnant El Ghani watched her husband's baby being born and save him by throwing him across the border to save him. He endured 47 hours of labor, 16 hours of hospitalization, and 1,000 hours of nursing aid by the Nepalese government and Abu Dhabi Care Fund.

This experience made his death a landmark in the history of Nepal, but has so far been very hard on the family since his death.\nAt the end of the night, unrolled cat, son, 3-year-old girl, nanny, and grandchildren watched the family's home take its last breath; el Ghani and his family waited in the Air Force tent until he was able to wiggle free and live. Once el Ghani was freed, he was able to make it back home in time to assist his wife and all those, with the help of his family, who served from the time they were very little. However, before he could become comfortably into his pajamas, el Ghani died.\nThe truth is, our country is, as he spoke in prison, a human tragedy, and our government has failed on this important issue. It’s time for our government to acknowledge the profound loss of our democracy and leadership to ensure that we can fully recover from this tragedy.\n""]"

1076,Opinion | Letâs Move Courts Online and Suspend Bail for Nonviolent Offenses,"['As a union attorney, I’ve observed many cases that have resulted in societal costs for police officers and other law enforcement organizations that harass and lie about the conversations officers have with citizens regarding any law enforcement issue. It is my belief that the cost of the role of an officer in law enforcement is enormous. Unfortunately, the cost of defending police officers and other law enforcement entities with violent crimes against us is a part of the price tag.\nIn the cases of Randall Davis and Dayan Wright, after the courts ordered them to pay $2,500 in fines, city officials filed suit, asking that their case be dismissed.\nIn 2014, a New York judge ruled that they could remain free pending appeal of the ruling. Three years later, in 2016, the Court of Appeals overturned the sentence against them on a specific charge of resisting arrest. Under a ruling by the 9th Circuit, a single element of a more serious felony could be used to convict the defendant without his family’s permission. Under this ruling, no person could be charged without the defendant’s consent. This ruling could be applied to any other felony that constitutes a further attack on citizen freedom.\nAdvertisement\nLate last month, the Washington Post reported that President Trump was planning a mass deportation of African American males and young Latino males who use their phones and digital devices to listen to political speeches. This would be the first time such a radical regulation has been applied to an assault on the civil rights of young black males.\nWhile I am appalled by the Trump administration’s actions, I do not find any evidence that such would constitute a crime or make any difference to the intent of the offending individual. I consider this assault upon civil rights to be an attempt to suppress the right of minorities to be political and political as well as the right of their political representatives to participate in political and political protests.\nI support all efforts to stop such harassment of peaceful protesters, but those efforts must be monitored thoroughly. They need to be kept in check. But there are dangers ahead. Any proposed action to expel immigrant workers is a step toward deporting those who already violate free speech or have not been charged with a crime.\nAlmost all the efforts to stop immigrant workers include illegal alien and undocumented Mexican immigrants, many of whom do not belong to America. In the New York case, employers informed the Supreme Court that they faced harassment and intimidation if immigration judges decided that some illegally illegal immigrants were being detained in the detention center. For example, in that case the private business owner informed ICE that other business owners were under arrest if any of them tried to cross the U.S.-Mexico border. And heeded the ICE agent’s warning and perked up the situation. In some instances ICE attorneys at New York’s Civil Service, convinced that business owners had no right to allow their employees to work on their properties, forced these employees to leave after a polite demonstration to show their solidarity with ICE.\nBeyond any consequences for the rights of unlawful immigrants, the legalization of undocumented workers is a further way of empowering law enforcement and restricting violent criminal behavior. If the government cannot function effectively and efficiently in border security, they must be forced to do so. Another strategy in restricting civil rights to immigrant workers is to grant the rights of those who move to other countries and have been undocumented and perhaps relocate to identify their rights.\nI join Mayor Muriel Bowser in condemning the Trump administration’s threat to ban immigrants from certain lands to the US as part of its “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy. I was offered two reasonable alternatives to following Trump’s unconstitutional attitude to civil rights – if the current leadership of the federal government could at least listen to a diverse and independent public.\nRather than pursuing immigration reform based on legal reasoning, many chiefs of state law enforcement in the United States are now rejecting the Congressional Council on Unfounded Stupidness, an unofficial policy of the Council that prohibits the conducting, conducting, conducting, conducting or, ultimately determining, whether or not criminal and legal discrimination may exist in any government authority.\nMcCloy Wade is Chief of Staff for the Senate Judiciary Committee and a Justice Department attorney. Key members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have all said that they support open government and open debate. The Human Rights Campaign strongly supports open government and support the enforcement of laws prohibiting racial discrimination.\n']"

This morning, New York Times writer Merylam Grant interviewed Metro editor-in-chief David Carr about the often bad-kept secret, especially since he’s the one who sometimes has to wash up on the street right after work in New York City.\nWell, apparently, there’s always the element of privacy in personal use here:\nHe works about, uh, really, like, ha, ha, ha, ha. It’s sad.\nIn this case, the problem is that M.B.S. s snipped out of existence way back in 2010, when it was defined as a quintessentially American security network: it’s safe on the premises, it’s open to members of the public. But generally speaking, when M.B.S. came out, it was vulnerable.\nAdvertisement\nNow M.B.S. scooplets that it became a significant distraction from its mission:\nBut it didn’t gain traction. In fact, there’s now an effort underway to clean out a somewhat murky corner of the system, which had been a de facto checkbook for the M.B.S. apparatus. One of these is a phone conversation between a M.B.S. staff member and a friend who had been unwittingly tapped, when an M.B.S. staffer was sitting outside. The phone spoke only at “all times,” and all told it took three minutes for the M.B.S. staffer to respond.\nAnd these are, frankly, the most critical questions you may have about phone conversations in the 21st century.\n']"

1081,Opinion | We Need to Flatten the Curve. Trump and Fox Are Behind It.,"['In the wake of today’s press release from Fox News accusing the network of “jailing” Donald Trump, I asked: How should President Trump respond?\nLast week, some analysis suggested that President Trump’s bombshell interview with CNN’s Laura Ingraham on Friday, which is now appearing on-air, could have “trusted” further evidence that Trump’s business associates were behind the attacks. This quickly went from standard to bullish to all-out skeptical, to say the least.\nIn a non-sequitur article published by National Review on April 5, January Jones of National Review condemned the “naive” call by Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, to “train our troops to track down terrorists.” Jones, like other critics, said the assault on the CNN program did not “appear to be a hate crime” and called on reporters to “prepare for a terrorist attack.”\nTrump appears to be taking the same position he did on the first day of the Trump era, with Clinton still threatening to use Twitter to try to hammer the media relentlessly about its heinous strategy against Clinton.\nShortly before Tuesday’s event, when Trump could have been shown with a photograph of Clinton on his back, he invoked the Tenth Amendment in a forum reminiscent of the Declaration of Independence in which he uttered the words of Thomas Jefferson, reminding everyone that their countrymen are fighting a war to stop them. The rhetorical treatment, employed as typical of all the pundits who have tried to dissect the crisis of media credibility in the wake of the Comey firing, does not place Trump on the same page as their punditry after the fire of Thursday’s dissemination of the news that revealed the FBI director resigned, and the White House has reacted with apocalyptic warnings that he will “totally destroy” the investigation into the Russia matter.\nHad Mr. Trump accepted the release of the News Corporation report Thursday, even if he hadn’t been present (even if he never has to be), and simply started insulting CNN and MSNBC on Friday morning, nobody would have given him a chance.\nIt is arguably appropriate for a president to resort to Trump’s “enemy of the people” on occasion. When President Obama called the White House to apologize for its “poor judgment,” he was defending the fact that Trump had shown a disregard for the relationship between journalists and political leaders. The GOP had received negative feedback from critics earlier in their rise to power and depended on those responsible to make the inconvenient truth their party’s official policy.\nThe article went on to call for a boycott of the News Corporation and other news media because it would harm Trump’s reputation, due primarily to his negative remarks. The reactions were unprecedented. Trump blamed NBC News for having fabricated the news that reigned so long before Trump’s election. He also compared the publication of an investigation into his contacts with Russians to the “locker room talk” with Monica Lewinsky.\nIn a response, I challenged Mr. Trump to address his paranoid tendencies and poor judgment by explaining how these are referred to as “illegal immigrants” and “undocumented workers.” In the open interview, Mr. Trump said the only reason he was elected president was because of his politics — ignoring the president’s less popular instincts and failing to explain the extensive range of the insane immigration saga.\nMr. Trump was giving politically inexperienced and out-of-touch reporters legal cover to lie. To my surprise, the news media announced they would look to Attorney General Jeff Sessions for justification for his shooting of a press reporter. With this being said, it is unclear if his consistent lies about CNN co-host Chris Cuomo and Bloomberg reporters influenced how they conducted their interviews. Perhaps President Trump just hopes to disrupt the “locker room talk” in some way.\nAs leaders, we need to speed up the way we are focusing on a bad news story, because we need the rules of the road to stop it, unless we guarantee a window of opportunity for the public to see the full breadth of the story.\nWe are talking, with the right rules, about changing politics, feeding the media, for the greater good.\nT and z t\n']"
1082,The Mystery of the Missing Bus Riders,"['It is time to get back to work in the summer with some fresh airline seats.\nThe Americans are as partial to drivers in the United States as Spanish citizens are to teachers, or coaches, or other certified passengers. And passengers without miles and miles at all may have stepped aboard their vehicle and paused to examine their license plates, nose sensors, and GPS devices before purchasing a new seat.\nIt seems as if it all came together after several conversations this week. But before you give up, first the Uber app and soon, the Uber app and Uber app.\nThe keywords for this new-age boo-boo--UPDATE: 100 million people will ride Uber on June 30-July 2, according to Uber CEO Travis Kalanick.\nUber\'s wheels will turn out to be pleasantly surprised when they land at the airport one day. Then it will learn that the new owners and his/her transportation company won\'t even start accepting new vehicles until they know their way around and repair a body built in-house.\nBack before Uber picked up a large chunk of the passenger load, Ram Trucking the United States was struck by one of the most bizarre announcements of recent times: This was about to be a high-profile launch, but until the Uber app was approved, the U.S. Commerce Department should have inspected new U.S.-licensed drivers on carpool rosters before starting its investigation.\nThat order was made under U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf, D-Va., and accepted by the Senate Transportation Committee on Wednesday, because Uber Chief Executive Officer Daniel Hertzfeld was planning to make the trip to Washington, D.C., to launch the new-age boo-boo ""10-Year Mobility Pass.""\n""Thanks to in-house civil engineers and the launch of the new Windows 8 platform, Uber has just picked the 10-year-old field to fly it from the Smithsonian,"" U.S. Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., wrote in a letter to Kalanick and the Commerce Committee, according to the New York Times. ""Uber and the new consumers who have experienced the ride-hailing experience have had the opportunity to walk in the cockpit and know the ride will start at 7 p.m. and complete three hours of ride ahead of our target time, in almost 100,000 vehicle miles.""\nHere\'s what happens if these few months of question were to vanish. First, a new passenger has to pay more for the service than the first. Second, if a rider is wrong and is a question from another, this fee jumps automatically. If a fellow passenger gets behind their traffic light at nearly 60 mph, their ticket goes to be charged, as expected. (In my experience, the fare gets shifted to the last possible minute after the driver has verified his or her status on a tracking app.) Third, if the ""seat"" is old enough to clean it up, the rides will be canceled. At best, it may take 18 minutes until someone in the booking process is able to tell the Uber guy, ""we\'re not going to run a new one.""\nLack of confirmation. No phone call from a customer. Delays at the airport. Little failure to deploy a new reservation system that will take any customer\'s information until they pay. A passenger to that transaction has to show that Uber is not doing their business as usual, but also has to say so, to the collection staff, to the cashier and to the chief of the consumer services desk.\nIf Uber is investigating the tickets and says it just picked up a lunch of snow wheat, the airline customer will have to provide a ride and pick up the price, and also in this case, he or she will not be charged for it.\nSo where, as we know through the enormous unemployment pick-up, is the conflict of interest between SpaceX owners? Uber made up an easy number: 1,000 new seats.\nWhy, then, are so many American airlines waiting until June 30 to confirm new passengers? A year for an alternative to Chinese pilots? A decade for a private equity firm, whose executives just made big money? The question of ""appropriate valuation"" (something Uber has essentially been doing for a decade, judging by the specific numbers Uber used to release results), and the dilemma of ""final destination of service"" is too close to another season, something Uber has instead requested in the months leading up to June 30.\nIt\'s a truism: Nearly every launch on that date will take place in San Francisco. And Uber will be on the pick-up line at the airport for a good four months, starting at 10:30 a.m. every day in the cities from that date.\n']"

In other words, the markets finished strong and created some pretty dramatic headlines.\nPeople weren’t just taking profits — they were piling into stocks.\nBy midmorning Friday, Boeing’s stock had risen to new highs.\nNorth Korea-related shares were especially a sellers’ choice, with major foreign miners down sharply as China’s foreign reserves dropped.\nGoogle shares have jumped more than 9%.\nFoolish writers were bracing for the surprise return of China’s central bank Wednesday, after Vice President Lu Chao presided over a rare engagement of Chinese officials in Beijing, and which sparked a flurry of communication from investors in the United States.\nThe three appointments completed a set of vaguely charged warnings that Hu Jintao must demonstrate a willingness to push the yuan back toward the world’s third-largest economy.\nXi is scheduled to return from his meeting in Mexico later this week, while the United States and Japan will hold talks in L.A. April 7-8.\nAnd an increasing number of European governments have been urging European Central Bank President Mario Draghi to act faster and more aggressively.\nInflation rose a little bit this week. The German government reported that consumer prices fell 4.8% in March, and the British government reported that inflation had increased slightly in March — compared to the previous month, though not as fast as previously thought.\nUncertainty is well away, with Germany’s Angela Merkel talking warmly of her country’s economic woes and on television talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on the condition that the euro zone break up.\nOn the other hand, Italy held a national conference to discuss its future when it goes on bond purchases — a monthly upgrade by the main vote-counting body. The country’s borrowing costs have risen since Draghi spoke up that week.\nAnd, of course, all this continued for another day.\nAnd, for another time, Japan also adjusted its policy course. The Japanese market hasn’t exactly been aggressive this year. That kind of market volatility could help the country in the coming weeks, if at all.\n“If this situation does come down and we see these sort of moves to disrupt markets over the next few days, that doesn’t mean the long-term picture is pretty bad,” said Nishantha Dunya, chief investment officer at First Trust Private Bank Japan.\n']"

Details of the call were first reported by the New York Times.\nTrump tweeted Monday night that he’d issued the “rule of law” after what he described as a “tremendous weekend of criminal prosecutions” and “indefinite detention.”\n“We’ve had a bad week, a lot of arrests, lots of outrageous acts that were carried out by authorities,” he said. “How could this be held up, and not prosecute?

1088,Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths,"['By Jared Hart\n(CNN) — The next few weeks are going to be chaotic for scientists worldwide as the Ebola outbreak in West Africa continues to grow and spread.\nIn Houston, Texas, dozens of people had a cold and fever Tuesday as one of the dozens in the first 24 hours with a documented strain of the disease were treated for the two Ebola patients who became ill in Houston. That’s when the virus started an unexpected cascade of tests, and experiments that have already revealed E.E. coli in much of the state.\nThe deadly virus, after it found its way from sub-Saharan Africa to the United States, has killed more than 165 people in the West African nation. The number of confirmed Ebola cases is predicted to grow as the World Health Organization considers deploying up to three dozen quarantined areas, and as African governments increasingly deploy available resources to contain the outbreak.\nJoel Edgerton wrote a recent post on CNN’s “Dateline NBC” blog, writing that “if West African nations reach their national health metrics by issuing new healthcare plans that specify right and wrong, they will ultimately demonstrate just how badly it needs health care.”\nAs it looks like E.E. coli numbers are set to increase, further research is also needed. In addition to the Ebola outbreak, it’s still important to see how many more cases this year will be confirmed. E.E. coli, which are commonly found in foods including meat, milk and eggs, has also been found in water. In 2015, the federal Centers for Disease Control reported 743 new cases of E.E. coli in 38 states.\nEdgerton said the CDC does, however, need to take extra precautions as the outbreak continues. The agency is currently extending the emergency responses that it put in place after several outbreaks of E.E. coli in 2014 and 2015. Some of those added to the response on Wednesday.\n“It’s time to redouble our efforts,” he told CNN. “We really do need to focus and act, and we do need to better manage a contagious contagion.”\nJared Hart writes a weekly column for CNN.

Gestation mortality rates in the country have ballooned from about 30 percent in 1985 to about 80 percent today. The CDC said that the disease is caused by the parasites that plague humans in the Philippines and spread to humans from other carriers.\nKieran Conroy, a defense clinical specialist in the emergency room at UAB’s medical school, said that there are no data that shows whether individuals have the bubonic plague on a significant scale. That’s because the organisms can spread normally within the body through food, from saliva to muscles.\nIn brief:\n— No confirmed cases of the bubonic plague in the United States.\n— Currently, there are 12 confirmed confirmed cases in Puerto Rico, eight in Florida, and four in Maryland. In Florida, there are still four cases of spreadable bacteria that haven’t had reported, but there has been a great deal of activity for some time.\n— Sixty-four cases have been confirmed worldwide, including four cases in Mexico. And in New Zealand, there are seven confirmed cases.\n— At least 42 infections have been confirmed in people in tropical regions like South Africa, Ethiopia, and Haiti and 11 in Somalia. There have been no confirmed cases of the bubonic plague in Maryland.\n— Cases of the plague have been confirmed in Cuba and Vietnam, and about 20 cases have been reported in New Zealand. As in the United States, there have been no confirmed cases in Pakistan.\n— There have been 10 cases of spreadable infections in Spain and two in Algeria, but there hasn’t been reported yet in Haiti.\n— There have been six confirmed cases in France, but there haven’t been reports of any deaths. Two cases were reported in Italy.\n— There have been 19 confirmed cases in the United States, and 11 of them have not been reported yet.\n— There have been 53 confirmed cases of emphysema. These include examples of emphysema on live humans -- women, men, children, and adults.\nIn the vast majority of cases, the fever or chronic fatigue syndrome don’t come off, and the bug doesn’t invade the body, but it can live on for days or weeks.\n— Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials have stressed that there’s no link between emphysema and sickening human beings, which they describe as a rare genetic trait. Symptoms last between a few and a few months and can last only for a couple of weeks, but ones that are fatal.\n— Health officials have been using the pneumococcal season to create a consistent testing program throughout the United States to determine where human deaths have occurred. It can be found in public health providers from Medicare to hospitals.\n— Meanwhile, coronavirus infections remain unreported. The CDC lists the Albemarle Westovirus as the top individual case in the United States, followed by diarrhea, pneumonia, and chicken pox.\n']"

1092,Opinion | The Pandemic vs. The President,"['By World AIDS Day\nIn 2015, we celebrated the world’s first-ever, global goal to eradicate the deadly virus, and we are seeking to spread the cure.\nOur personal journeys toward that goal, however, are often shrouded in controversy, controversy, controversy. Like everybody else, we try to avoid it. It reminds us that with all of the challenges we face we never let things get in the way of progress, and we just have to keep getting better.\nIn 2015 we began to see the emerging efforts by many countries to battle the deadly disease. The number of universal public health interventions are projected to reach 3 billion in 2018. By that point, more than 51 million people have undergone treatment, and nearly 1 million have been cured, a remarkable achievement.\nWe also began to see some progress. Those who had been treated for malaria had virtually no symptoms. What had transformed was the discovery of a community-based antimalarial medication called Replico, which had been stockpiled during the previous epidemics of malaria. With the combination of the four antimalarial medications and the zinc replacement medication, the medication made an immediate and significant difference. It cut off the immune system’s responses to malaria and eliminated the need for treatment. But the double whammy is the introduction of even more prescription-drug misuse; many people evade the use of drugs due to stigma, stigma and fear.\nSo we began to wonder if it would be possible to get rid of malaria and get rid of this disease in time. The answer lies in research by friends of mine and others in the field of malaria.\nI set out to study malaria with the number one goal in mind. I wanted to find the answer to the answer to the “why”: for the benefit of the public. That is why I plan to detail the results of my recent research at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Public Health (AAPPH) in San Francisco this coming September.\nMy research explores how preventative interventions, like malaria medications, like replico, are linked to the prevention of malaria. The idea is that it’s the reduction of symptoms, the delivery of a disease prevention medication to the patient, that makes a difference. It helps the patient decide if their problem with malaria is a health problem, and is then considered critical and prevented. After that, the patients can focus on the other life-threatening conditions that call for a different type of treatment.\nSince the start of this year, more than 3,200 malaria cases have been diagnosed in the U.S. alone and almost 4,000 deaths are attributable to the disease. Because the burden of malaria is so low, we are providing treatment to as many patients as possible as much as possible. We are also setting up blood donors to prevent malaria and identify people who are carriers of the disease.\nWe will analyze some results from my research on this topic and make our recommendations to the international medical community.\nI want to make a point of saying that malaria treatment is not the problem. This is because until the disease is cut off, it is a single disease disease. The simple benefit of malaria treatment is that it prevents infection from getting to the person the disease strikes.\nThere is a “one shot” approach that can reduce the burden of the disease. We prescribe malaria medications that are effective against malaria but also must be given to everyone who lives in a region that has the best shot of living on the same bed as a malaria diagnosis. And we also prescribe a new kind of antimalarial pill.\nI want to assure everyone that this data will be shared with clinicians and private health-care companies to demonstrate that it is possible to minimize the burden of malaria. And my research will be tailored to cases in which all sides of a public-health challenge are equally different and that makes getting rid of the disease easier.\nAnd let me tell you that I have taught myself this before: If you want to see progress, not only are you trying to make progress but you want your friends and your colleagues to know too. Every person has the right to go to a doctor and ask him to prescribe a new drug. People have to be tried together; they have to accept and think outside the box.\nThat has only been a “One Shot” approach. I am not going to be the one to make what is going to be a “One Shot” an “A.”\n']"

Donald Trump only stepped down as the President's America First father. The shock was pippin' inescapable. For the twelve months that followed Trump emerged largely unsteady and nervous.\nHis ascendance to power would seem futile until one couldn't help but watch as the border is being cracked by other border states and potential criminals. He understood that he was getting the name he wanted but added: 'the name that put the Union back in gear.' It was his simple way of saying... 'this is my garden.' It wasn't a huge leap from his Russia trip but he wasn't mopey or dry or ego-destroying.\nThe question now is how can we allow the President of the United States to buy into our new America's new resolve?\nWhere, then, will this new resolve work?\nBollywood has ruled the American electorate since the Jim Crow era, and it is hard to look at the current President. His most recent mantra, '…how do we fix this?' asked progressive activists to their questions in Madison, Wisconsin, last week. Perhaps the answer, to cite the last campaign and Mueller investigation, is: 'we need to understand how to fix this.'\nThe need to ensure a rapid, well-defined exit and re-election scenario is not only unfulfilled but also impractical. To overcome what the implication should be, Trump needs to calm down and allow international opinion to move on.\nTrump's grand plans for “Fix the Mic” with Mexico and Canada continue to work, but unless him obliges, the United States will be back at a standstill for many years. The political America is littered with so-called dysfunctional parts and now Trump is asking for the raw pull-your-knee-in-the-sand to head off-the-nationalistic tremors.\nWith the Democratic and Republican mainstream of the United States all firmly committed to the dream of a three-way separation, it seems unlikely that the President will ever achieve a solution by himself. The plain fact is that the president of the United States has nothing short of enormous national popular support -- and that fact alone trumped any measures to pull the United States back from its precipice.\nThe future is uncertain and in the meantime, we need to slow down and move our elections on. Until that happens, we need to listen to all the voices to listen to the answers.\n""]"

O’s, OT’s, T..). “When I asked the office in Boulder, CO, which is the city of St. Louis, to help us identify the kind of symptoms you should hear in this study, many of those symptoms were related to the coagulation of the Clovis virus that’s now emerging from the Honduras virus,” he added.\nVega told the Times there could be a 70% increase in these symptoms since 1980 — in fact, in 2012, the WHO saw an increase in all forms of HPV from an increase of 40% to an increase of 75%. In 2008, the CDC reported a 17% increase. It is those cancers that could have been affected by Coronavirus: Hepatitis C, C-A, cervical cancer, and Anemia.\n“Coronavirus can be extremely dangerous, particularly for older adults and even younger persons with one of these most frequent risk factors of infection: Hepatitis C,” the science announced in the February issue of The Lancet (T).\nAs documented by the Centers for Disease Control, Coronavirus in babies and young children is the most lethal form of infection. That’s understandable. But don’t get distracted by an inversion of script from the NIH. It’s something the agency’s chief Dr. Richard Evans told Fox News (Foxkirt) on a recent podcast that showed a favorable correlation between annual survival rates, life expectancy, and types of Coronavirus.\n“There’s no reason to get sick at 2.5 years,” Evans said. “You didn’t die after that. There were 2.5 years of survival at 40, 8.5 years of age, and that means if someone was doing a nice job, you wouldn’t have to suffer because you haven’t changed your behavior (and) if you haven’t been doing a whole lot (for some reason), you’d be in better shape because you’re not sick, and if you’re not sick, you’re going to grow very, very old.\n“I would say that we would be doing a much more prudent treatment if that was the disease we were seeing today,” Evans continued. “We would certainly be getting more people back into these patterns. And until we see an increase, we could continue getting disease every time we get a case.”\nWell, no. But maybe something should be done about it.\n']"

1100,"Stephen Sondheim, the Man Who Felt Too Much","['There’s nothing wrong with being a writer of romantic comedies, and it shouldn’t matter how funny they are.\nYou’re taking stock from the best ones, of course, like “The Great Gatsby” and “The Hunger Games,” about pirates taking over a Chinese town. But the Peanuts have you straightened out and into the 19th century and have your pal-turned-poet Steve Martin understand.\nWorking for Ron Moore’s Ryan Seacrest, who was his collaborator on “Ghostbusters,” Moore starts off by proving he’s the character he was (obviously). The movie-makers are delighted when he makes people laugh. Then for good measure, he says his character’s wife — who he obviously relishes — laughs at him, with which they create a Trump-like weekend “boringness” that keeps us from escaping the obnoxious drive-by flick we have so far.\nIt doesn’t stop there, though. Reeel around these three returning characters, reunited around this same subject, and you realize their mutual respect. It’s especially helpful with the surprise that everything turns out to be quite lovely. Michael, an actor I would never associate with, gives the whole story he directs and the rest of the cast — including Mitch Hurwitz, who was Dolly Parton’s producer-chef and currently produces the film — some weight. He’s so sure all we have is pitchforks and explosions that the film totally stops with him. (Chastity Russell, who plays the actress, said she’s “the one we need” because she’s so awful.) And even the snideness and mistrust from David Silverman, his cameraman who makes sure to realize his job is more important than his voice. He even gets Rick Santelli, the bandmate from the Spielberg movies, to deal with some of his mismatched nerves.\nIt’s all beginning to pay off. The opening scene is a throwback to the King Arthur movies and “The Crucible,” about a high-school boy whose home was changed to a lower-security prison. A menacing, second-grader, Wyatt Lee, seems to do better than Dale Carnegie but his ambitions are ill-defined, even after he takes a part in a reality TV show with various audiences. When Wyatt asks Sally, the blond-haired waitress, why her feelings are all wrong, Sally points out that it’s just not appropriate. But Wyatt’s still quite immature, so Sally has to convince his old friend to continue what she started.\nAfter Wyatt returns from trial, he finds a house he spent a lot of time in before being granted the house to be torn down. It’s an ugly, ugly place that needs fixing. The upside is that Yates (who has written the screenplay for “Spy” and presumably directed the film) has a clear writing style and is so good at making his characters appealing that he had no choice but to use his thick set voice to deliver a message — “How do you feel about death?” he asks the kid in the opening scene. He also adds humor and symbolism. To Dana Carvey, the character on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” the movie has a “Mister Miserable.”\nTruly, it’s silly-looking, but at least it’s fun to watch Sally — who’s without prosthetics — being turned upside down in a trunk while everyone else prances around. Of course, that’s just gravy.\n']"

The villagers, both British soldiers, are lonely and the villagers are rough. Their odd duo lives in the cloisters of Hogwarts, while the local boy, fed, wandering the streets is called Cosh.\nIn the 1943-44 Civil War, the two subjects first made a point of meeting each other, having loved each other and getting along. Things come to a head in the Civil War, when Irishmen Edward Polenankin, a drunk, and his cricketer husband, Henry Retiere O`Sullivan, an Irishman, are arrested for trying to bomb a British fortress. ""The Little Match Child"" is about Polenankin\'s toughest attack ever, in the war in which he and his partner, Taghganhein Abadon, murdered an American soldier at the U.S. embassy in In.\nIn the Civil War, the two African-American men meet in ""Mount Cattell,"" a small town where Edward Polenankin has been appointed the mayor. Polenankin is the son of Uncle Jackie Rogers, a Confederate general who was gone and had once complained to Edward that the three of them were ""just sisters"" - like Indians.\nW.E.B. Du Bois speaks much of Vermont\'s slowly making up of African-American people, with its disquieted social movement of the segregated period, with an awful siege at Mount Hamilton. Its genius, however, was its invention of desegregation: Mount Hamilton owes its own name to a legal company that was instrumental in desegregating the court system in that very area.\nIn ""Mount Cattell,"" we are also introduced to Caleb Cosin, a distant but fantastic descendant of the late, great Sherwood Christian Cooper, a mind-bending talent whose books, movies and plays hit everything we need to make us laugh.\nSo it is that some variations on ""Mount Cattell"" are fictitious, while others are timeless and come across as ""just funny,"" regardless of what the actors say. It is hard to imagine anyone or anything that will screw us up in the near future: The craft services of fine actors and a deep understanding of the language, all come to pass.\n""Mount Cattell"" opens in cinemas Wednesday.\n']"

1105,The Weekly | Meet the Woman Who Outsmarted Boko Haram,"['— It is worth remembering that through the sheer brutality, horror and brutality of it all— Boko Haram has razed around 30,000 villages since 2014. Many of the structures were destroyed by ISIS. And certain people have gone so far as to have no knowledge of what is happening back home.\n“It is like walking in many streets that an X happened to see and wanted to go out and help him,” said the farmer. Boko Haram is known to kill and rape women, girls and children. This remains true for recent Chibok schoolgirls whose forced recruitment by Boko Haram in 2014 exacerbated the suffering faced by the girls. Of course, rather than being forced to leave the village— how many girls and women have perished at Boko Haram’s hands? — Boko Haram fighters, Boko Haram women and young men, about 300 militants and assorted regime supporters killed, and remain active. Many suspects were arrested, said the farmer. “They killed one of the bodies, and the dead men then adopted other victims of the attacks,” said the farmer.\n— “I think it would be really interesting if you could meet a schoolgirl who could go out and help other girls in Borno State and actually find out who these people are,” said the farmer. The desperation is palpable. Nearly everything is destroyed in Nigeria, in the heart of the cities and on public streets. Everywhere, there is a void that it could not have been written without Boko Haram’s men and women. … According to activists, the fighting is just starting to subside, with al Qaeda inside the country rampaging through to Nigeria in a massive offensive that continues now, according to Somalia expert and former Nigerian army general, Joseph Kato, who lives in Cameroon.\n— Women walking through the town of Sperkpol used to dress up in little black dress from street clothes. Now they dress in white and as policewomen. But the news is not over. Ask Hillary Clinton or George Stephanopoulos how they can honestly believe and say that Boko Haram is still capable of killing you and your children? Or why they prefer to post government attacks on Boko Haram while simply maintaining the same positions. And they know no contest here. “Boko Haram is playing on the fears of women and children; it’s all made a lot more difficult by Boko Haram’s groups,” said the blogger, Josephi Ndebele. “They’re putting the blame on women and children for everything they’re doing.”\nA highly anticipated speech is being planned in three parts for St Louis. It will feature children’s and adult motivational speakers, delegates from conferences, calls from global leaders and eminent experts. These speakers include a number of world leaders. General Willis Kruly, the leader of the police in Nigeria, will speak at the event on Friday. “I believe these conferences are the best thing to do this year. There is such an imbalance in the world that men should have more education,” said the man responsible for championing education. “And in the long run, girls should have the opportunity to be educated,” said the Nigerian theologian and author, John Lewis, on Thursday.\n']"
1106,Opinion | How to Fix the Coronavirus Testing Mess in 7 Days,"['By Mika Cahuain\nEditor, Royston Melville:\nEven though the CDC accidentally confirmed the World Health Organization’s (WHO) 25th Disease Control number — the Coronavirus — only 1,894 people have died from it, a huge animal could lead to the spread of the disease. A 7-day catch period between the outbreak and its conclusion would send fish, invertebrates, chicken and shrimp to record-keeping lists and cause other illnesses, but even at that level, anyone with a fever, moderate to severe headache and a body mass index of 40 to 50 would be immune to the virus.\nIn most cases, someone infected with or who was infected with Coronavirus can recover or regain mobility and continue working. That’s why it’s important to keep a checklist of the people whose symptoms and status are usually marked as possible cases of an illness.\nThe list includes symptoms consistent with the illness seen in an infected person and people with evidence of another illness. (Adult diarrhea and a cold are particularly common at these times; from 7 p.m. to 4 a.m., get the lowest needed checkups — give yourself at least three weeks of rest.)\nViruses also regularly appear in person.\nIf you have a fever that could be severe or remain so long, the list should also include symptoms consistent with death.\nImagine the symptoms that you may receive. Everyone who has been sick could experience these symptoms. Not having a fever and serious headache caused by the infection can indicate that there is a symptom. A fever can also suggest a condition that should be treated.\nOf course, colds, typhoid and infections with travel sickness can also do the trick.\nKeep a log of what you’ve been sick, and the flu and other immune-system disorders that may have affected you.\nPiglets are fine to catch. Keep a note of your symptoms so you can look for them on the outside of your nose, under your arms, on your lips, mouth and stomach. Also track your symptoms closely.\nIt’s better to have control measures in place.\nUnfortunately, less-than-perfectly diagnosed cases are the predominant cause of infection.\nTake care when dealing with the virus, especially if you choose to stand it out against the others. Keep calm and carry out high-tech surveillance. Also, find a licensed pathologist to consult with.\nDon’t hesitate to talk to a professional, but do it not only for show, but for public health.\n----------\n× (c) 2018 of Cahuain\nWriter:\n']"

It wasn’t always like this. The not-so-palm rain was kind of rarer in America back then. And how to deal with the germs should just be simple: Case-in-point.\nMidrash and signature monkey viruses, or coronavirus, have now invaded American soil through the feces of unwitting travelers in the mail and failed to carry the appropriate safety testing, or get help, according to a presentation Tuesday from the Center for Infectious Disease Research, NJCDC, at Boston University’s Allen Institute for Space Health Sciences, as reported in Science magazine.\n“Those infected with pet smelly flight insects came from abroad and arrived before scheduled inspections that were made available,” T.J. MacMahen, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research at NORTHSTAR Science and Technology University in Rhode Island, told Scientific American. “If they had exceeded, they would not have returned to the United States and have not been detected.”\nOne way the virus has been spreading through other countries is with dogs or people who have been exposed to other species of travelers, MacMahen said.\nThe institute published the findings in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases in 2016, accompanied by a statement by an official in the Clinton administration, Michael “Sherman” Croner. The Bush administration did not release data before the publication of the document.\nLike pet viruses, coronavirus has been spreading through humans and birds for decades with a version known as Yoca, according to William Yang, a microbiologist at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, where they treat astronauts’ pets and tracheauses.\n“Animal pathogens tend to sneak up on humans in the U.S.,” Yang said.\n“And we tend to get coronavirus as well,” he added. “Even those that already have had rashes and other symptoms haven’t gotten as far. And so it’s difficult to prevent infection.”\nYang asked the international air carrier industry to prepare contingency plans that might include developing a system to handle people with other countries infected with Coronavirus and distributing p-o/xxa samples that test positive in the mail as well.\n“We would typically send them directly out and we would try to recover those samples,” Yang said. “And so the first step would be identifying the source of the sample and how the human transmission occurred.”\nThe protein and fibers that make up the nasal scrub coat the nose are called olfactory currents, or NFO. They transmit germs through your nose, using a substance in your body called polyps that vibrate to escape harmful bacteria.\nPeople with Kapostomy syndrome, most commonly known as a case of infant blood fever and chlamydia, use old medical vials to carry the germ for more than five days before consuming the germ-filled droplets that flood into the mass of the nose or mouth. Pap smears are common in humans to help hide the infection.\nCigna (NYSE: CI) does not require full blood or regular Pap smears to identify people who are at risk for coronavirus infection, it added in a statement.\n“We think the events, or lack thereof, have only amplified the reality that we are dealing with a potentially dangerous common infectious disease,” the statement said. “Cigna’s customers still store some of their platelets at their patients’ home blood banks and are considered a source of blood for their blood vessels and they may purchase and use certain types of mixtures to infect the passengers.”\nCigna warns that infection with “orchestrated infectious agents” is very rare. “Testing for signs and symptoms associated with bacterial infection is routine for all passengers in these airlines,” said Claire Nickels-Richardson, a spokeswoman.\n']"
1108,"With Coronavirus, It's Time to Declare a National Emergency - The New York Times","['Editorial: The American Institute of Tropical Meteorology predicts a potentially deadly case of Coronavirus beginning in April 2019.\nCoronavirus is an extremely contagious bug with potentially fatal consequences.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was involved in the response to the first case of pneumonia in humans in 2016 and they have started the search for cause.\nThe long-term goal is to bring this organism under control.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\n“By definition, Coronavirus can affect adults and children. It was first diagnosed in myocardial infarction (heart attack) in 1981, and it is now one of the most common in diseases transmitted by infection.”\nReported cases of pneumonia have been falling steadily since 2009 in California and Florida.\nAccording to the CDC,\n“Coronavirus can cause death within minutes of infection. By law, these are only symptoms that affect the brain, spine, nervous system, cardiovascular system and immune system.”\nDoctors expect normal blood pressure and blood pressure to be normal by the time the Coronavirus is diagnosed.\nIt may affect brain health with stress and fever, but may not be fatal.\nDoctors estimate that more than five million cases of pneumonia were reported between 2008 and 2012.\nIn some of these cases, patients only have one or two symptoms, and they don’t develop long-term health problems. They also tend to last through the usual pattern of illness, but at some point, this must occur.\nSome people can even die without warning.\n“The chance of death from disease is not known, but sometimes the probability of death is low,” epidemiologist Pamela Pochier of the Dutch team of medicine told CNN affiliate DPA.\n“Most people die from pneumonia but a few people die with diarrhea, but some people cannot even imagine,” explained elderly man Joel Gunn.\nA healthy person typically takes antibiotics and days to recover.\nBut patients will usually heal slowly and without severe pain. This is why they won’t survive long. And the same could happen with a Coronavirus patient.\nDoctors estimate these cases can take six to eight years to save, but they can be mild or severe.\nThe virus is transmitted through infections to health care workers, doctors, pets, teens, children and very young children. It can be passed by bites, sprains, viral infections, rotting food and other waste products.\nDo these types of infections pose a risk?\nIt’s not clear whether prolonged exposure to Coronavirus can cause a life-threatening bout of pneumonia.\nDr. Thomas Eckman, a senior physician in the patient care unit at Marshall Children’s Hospital of Tampa, told CNN the virus can spread through blood pressure, blood pressure, liver and brain, and other parts of the body.\n“We know that any worsening of symptoms due to a Coronavirus infection may be fatal for people younger than 20 years,” Dr. Eckman said.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that most Coronavirus infections are contained in infected eyes, ears and/or skin, or later a person suffers two or more symptoms of the disease.\nBecause the disease was transmitted between someone and infected person, someone that contracted the virus and should have known about the infection has immunity.\n“Once the disease is diagnosed, authorities are notified and a person is brought in for assistance,” according to the CDC.\nIf a person is infected with a Coronavirus infection, they may experience symptoms with varying degrees of illness.\nParticularly severe diseases include chlamydia, gonorrhea, diphtheria, tetanus, malaria, septicaemia, diarrhea, pneumonia, fever, norovirus, norovirus or chlamydia.\n']"

1110,"Opinion | How Much Worse the Coronavirus Could Get, in Charts","['How much worse the contagious chills could get, in terms of radiation fallout and infections?\nAnd how long it will take for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to see the full extent of the problem. The CDC has set a likely annual target of two to three years of exposure to Chills, which translates to the annual equivalent of at least one case of chills, z, my wife found this week.\nChills can cause shivering, at times with overzealous drips and air droplets. They can indicate a large risk of infection and can also cause nausea, skin aches, and nauseating diarrhea. And they can cause cancer.\nPatients may also suffer from C. difficile, a blood bacterial infection in which bacteria release as many toxins in the body as they need to work as efficiently as possible in order to function properly. When C. difficile reaches the bloodstream (a more rapid reaction of microorganisms) it can affect cells in the body, reproductive organs, many of which have no blood, making it almost impossible to carry out daily functions. C. difficile is a complication because an adult can become infected within minutes or weeks of infection.\nMostly, the CDC\'s estimate assumes that no new cases will be reported because patients don\'t have symptoms. For example, it should remember that when people are exposed to this type of bacteria they experience higher rates of diarrhea, fever, and swollen lymph nodes.\nSo, any extra dose would probably mean less, but as the CDC itself said, a dose of drugs with lower durations would be much harder to administer.\nSuppose, however, that the situation were more like that of the true or confirmed Chills would spread to the whole country.\nWhat does all this mean? The CDC predicts that people will develop recurrent cases of vomiting, dizziness, headache, and trouble sleeping in general. A heart attack or seizure could be called ""a strike. Never"" in the U.S.\nSimilarly, if the Chills spread to the next region of the country, how much of it will it spread to other regions? And if people in different parts of the country don\'t respond to every pill or carb-heavy (or even super-fast) medication, how much of it will it spread over those regions?\nBecause people usually do not become infected with Chills, they may ultimately become more sensitive to the poisonous chemicals used by this bacterial infection. This could allow the bacteria to re-infect undetected by passing through their receptors in the body. This could contribute to hyperpigmentation and a build-up of bacteria that feed on the surface of people\'s intestines.\nIt would also look so natural that it was observed by the CDC to infect people with chills. It\'s less likely that the CDC also investigated other viruses, like mosquitoes, which transmit chills.\nAnd it is more likely that chills may even spread to other bodily functions, such as energy drinks, a favorite consumption for the infected person.\nBut these health experts have a fantastic piece of software to scan for other outbreaks. In 1996, according to National Institutes of Health, chills touched over 2 million people in 122 countries. In 2004, more than 3 million visits to hospitals were reported.\nThus the experts can now enter a whole host of agencies and individuals to look at and document the real-world Chills that people now feel uncomfortable eating and drinking. From those now-referred to Chills, they can be closely related to symptoms of diseases like cancer, AIDS, and malaria.\nAs summarized by Robert M. Connors, molecular microbiologist and author of Diagnostics to Heal: Understanding the Secret History of Disease and what to do about it, a chills infection increases the risk of cancers in the brain, particularly of the prostate gland, the lymph nodes and the bladder and a range of other health conditions.\nThis article is provided as follows:\n']"

I have been a follower of the fever ever since my mother returned from the States in 1962. She had a fever, and when we went to see her she was a little sleepy and very scared. My mother told us that EDR, or abnormal pulmonary bleeding, had been happening and that the infection was too high for her to be in and out of the hospital. In retrospect I wish she was up here at the old office with the elderly mom, but she is not.

There will be a plague of AIDS in the developing world and with that, maybe even the end of man and his family.

What if you were a U.S. federal judge, who sits in a county courthouse? Would you appoint a federal judge to decide your cases?\nIf you answered yes, you’re moving into a courtroom with dozens of U.S. judges sitting next to you.\nOn Friday, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. gave a series of interviews to promote the right’s judicial restraint and said the court is not standing by simply for members of Congress or judges to sit on their own benches.\n“How many times has the Supreme Court held that Congress cannot comply with statutory authority to effectuate judicial decisions?” asked Roberts. “I don’t know if I’ve said this before, but we are certainly free to change our laws and see what happens. That is the purpose of the Constitution and the purpose of Congress and what we are being challenged in courts today.”\nTo solve a problem that is not well understood and easily confronted by elected officials, the Supreme Court took over the clock for the rest of the way to preserve the Federalist Papers and Coretta Scott King.\nInstead of holding the Supreme Court closed for all of the day, Roberts and Roberts wrote letters to President Donald Trump, asking him to sign, without hesitation, a revised version of the Federalist Papers. The Justice Department was at his side as the legal team dismantled the Constitution.\nThe courts have played a role in ensuring you and me have access to your cases, hearings and the procedure you’re supposed to use to make decisions. But the lack of regulation by courts such as the court led to judicial gridlock and collateral damage to our communities, the economy and our cherished democracy.\nInjustice is only among the wealthiest nation on Earth, but powerful corporate executives know that they can count on a judicial system now for checks and balances.\nHerman Cain’s immigration policy: “Jeff Sessions is a denier.

At the same time, just as most writing jobs became creative, so were production jobs. It was hard at times, especially with actors and such storytellers. Sometimes they could be in the chair. Sometimes, actors, as they cannot often be no-shows at conventions for the foreign actors. But many of them can be in our room together.

1116,Opinion | A Story From Inside the Coronavirusâ Early Whirlwinds,"['Please enable Javascript to watch this video\nGENEVA -- The viral spread of the Coronavirus (Viruses) still hasn\'t hit this country or even in Europe or Asia. Experts are expecting more in the coming days.\nThe first person to receive a viral norovirus infection in Switzerland was a 25-year-old man from a village called Gulgdur with heart and lung disease, the Swiss government said Friday.\nBut now a third person in California has developed more serious symptoms. Because some of the virus is airborne, the virus can travel north from anywhere in the world, and be spread by sneezing.\nPeople who enter Switzerland and Italy are at high risk for virus transmission.\nThere\'s a serious undercurrent to the spread of the Coronavirus.\n""It is spread through coughing, sneezing, and through urine and feces,"" Erik Osolfo, immunologist and epidemiologist at the University of Switzerland in Geneva, told CNN Health.\nHe told CNN Health that there is no better way to handle the spread of the virus than to help people avoid it so they can protect themselves.\nThe first person to develop the virus is more likely to die: Most cases occur in infected people who are normally healthy and rich enough to eat, but others are highly infected, leading to the spread of this virus.\nThe virus is associated with immunosuppressive drugs and immunochemical reactions, not adults, and it can be seen for more than 200 days in a person exposed to it, according to the World Health Organization.\nAccording to the ABC News website, at least three other Canadians and two Australians were infected by the virus in a Zurich-area resident of the West Bank.\nDoctors are waiting for the results of their tests before they can order a diagnostic procedure.\n""Preventative measures include antibiotic treatment and antiviral treatment,"" Swiss health authorities said in a statement.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said more than 50,000 Canadians were infected by the virus during 2015-2017.\nThe CDC is urging people to be in good working order.\n""All human viruses are perishable and the body should not handle them,"" the statement said.\nUnitedHealth Group, a company that runs Humana healthcare plans for older Americans, told CNN Health that hospitals should first isolate or treat the infected people if they can.\n""You need to speak to your provider and if possible you have to get medical attention if you’re infected,"" said Van Winkle Prince, the company\'s vice president of global health outreach.\nCalls to the company\'s hotline and its website can be directed to 71 Nellie Street, N.W.\nIn Switzerland, there is no specific outbreak, but the Swiss health department told CNN Health that an active avian influenza strain could infect people and the virus could spread through the air.

1117,Opinion | Theyâve Contained the Coronavirus. Hereâs How.,"['That itâ\x80\x99s polluted with the Coronavirus, or what has to do with humans, sick, gorillas and, well, the other corporeal goodness, are a fraud.\nWell, maybe some people are, but what Iâ\x80\x99m hearing, from people on the internet, isnâ\x80\x99t based on science.\nLike a cyborg, most people have had their reflexes shaken, even though it seems there are apparently no real causes to that incident. And there are results from virtually every tool, not the least of which is local bacteria, microsphere bacteria, vara galescovirus, and, again, the ""Gaspa-M. -a probiotic, commonly used in lab tests as preventive therapy for pathogens.\nThe one man from the US who deals with bile, apparently living on Lake Chula Vista, will soon be taken to a reputable laboratory, in Ohio, to get the bug, or vivan, if they are better on site.\nFor another leak:\nSymptoms of the Coronavirus include very minor fever, and blurred vision and slimy abdomen.\nIt doesnâ\x80\x99t appear to be doing a good job protecting humans from incurable pathogens such as the human papillomavirus (HPV) nor was it identified by the World Health Organization as a human that had participated in a case.\nHowever, itâ\x80\x99s likely that the data from man to man is correlated with transmission by surface water, including air in specific places.\nHhmmmmm, then, what has the virus been up to for months, except strangely, the virus has not spread. Indeed, certainly the full sample report is unlikely to show anything at all different; it probably exists only in the smallest testing area, a mere few buildings.\nSo, what do we do? What do we do? Well, as the other Vivan infections have shown, vaccines arenâ\x80\x99t protective at all; those that do donâ\x80\x99t protect us from a harmful bacteria, either.\nPerhaps our next approach will be, as Mitch and Jen Brugger so please tell us so please, taking cues from the Crohnâ\x80\x99s disease study, where the CDC seems to be paying particular attention to handling Vivan.\nEven if that may be too much of a hiccup, given the trickle-down principle, like blood levels, it remains that average people must be cautious.\nBeyond that, more research will be needed and it remains to be seen what is, and what isnâ\x80\x99t, possible with Vivan infections. If enough testing occurs to see if the link is rooted in the transmission of a flesh-eating organism, such as a Pap smear, then it may well be that the virus is actually in there, so viruses should not be exploited.\nOh, and, by the way, taking into account that the bugs appear to have been transmitted to test subjects while theyâ\x80\x99re still alive, is technically just as dangerous as the infection itself.\nSo whatever angle one may choose to take to save the world, they must be cautious.\n']"
1118,Opinion | We Need to Flatten the Curve. Trump and Fox Are Behind It.,"['By Newt Mednick, CNN\nWhen I was just a kid, I was so nervous about an upcoming test of age when I had to wait to lift my glasses, and in case of missing my glasses I could not stand. And this is why last week, I was thrilled to watch Steve Bannon’s keynote at the summit that Trump has pushed for: A Presidential Trillion Dollar Fair.\nSpeaking of hearing the familiar remarks of a political bellwether, my nerdy 90s friend Stanislaw Kuchar turned out to be right. Actually, I’m losing track of the words he used, but it still made me look dumb.\nWell, Stanislaw Kuchar wasn’t in the hotel where the summit was being held just like you might expect. The president had apparently invited him to the summit (I assume he knew his guests well enough to invite them, but only out of course he did). So, should President Trump ever invite me to a much greater summit? No. Or should he merely invite a friend, as Dick Cheney once did? Or should he invite a copy of the Reagan manual, as Dick would probably not have thought of it if he saw it?\nIs President Trump engaging in a level of personal animus toward my fellow Trumpites on the left? No. The fact is that he’s not interacting with your colleague Donald Trump, you know who you are. I’m still the president.\nAmerica is crumbling, where the supermajority leadership we’ve enjoyed in Congress seems likely to crumble at some point, in the face of the same underlying reasons why my Republican friends voted against me in 1996: political correctness, fear of big government, and a rigged American system.\nYeah, it is. At least one of my Republican friends would say the same thing.\nDon’t underestimate the danger to our country of brainwashing the Trumpites. It has happened before. Franklin Roosevelt used his strategy to start a war on people who had had no real education at all. The New Deal was in retreat when he pushed for military bases and free trade.\nBut when he didn’t invent his dream, he did it by starting wars on people who weren’t meant to be warriors against an army on one side, and burning up acres of fertile land on the other side, fueling a gridlock that hurt the country badly.\nHell, do we even need another “national disgrace,” Donald Trump, who’s just speaking a press conference, trying to make a point and deflecting from himself as well as a lot of people’s best wishes for so much sun and comfort?\nI can see why liberals will go along with this description. The idea of “socialized medicine” – the one deal that hadn’t been discussed before, or not discussed for many years – would motivate boomer feminists to give up their privileges and become instead pure party loyalists.\nBut, don’t get me wrong: Being a socialist means that you’re endangering society. That’s not what we’re all about. It’s what I’m about. Being more than a socialist means living in the moment.\n']"

It’s possible you’ve lost your home or are close to it; you’re under attack and running roughshod over the tires. It’s always traumatic, but it’s not so sudden that the thought of not being able to get home on time and missing your bus in more than an hour strikes you as a mystery.\n(In this time of changing commuting patterns, it’s hard not to take the word a little at a time, and think, “That’s quite a nice bag.”) But the common card that seeps into the mind is, well, making it seem so. Seeing a stranger knocking on your door is, apparently, surprisingly rare. Consider these latest stories:\n“I was looking for my grandma’s very last call. She’s normally checking in with the station. She called, I’ve come across this news, she called to be sure. I don’t know where she is, and she’s, you know, you don’t say anything about it. She was calling, there’s no way I could make the call. My grandfather isn’t here right now, he’s on vacation.”\n“I was texting, and she texted, she’s been at work. She’s been texting, and she’s been texting. She’s telling me she’s got a home address, and she’s going to be coming to work. I texted and she asked, ‘So? Where’s my son from?’ And she said, ‘Well, Dad, I have my son who has taken two last rides. My son, he was driving alone, and I was doing my five minutes’ worth of ride. My son and I decided that we’d have to call again. He was riding alone, and she was on his left. My son was driving somewhere, and when he came to pick him up he turned back and said he had his son and his car. He reached out to me and said, ‘Dad, I need your son.’ He hit me and hit me. I said, ‘OK, OK.’ Then he came home, so he didn’t have to pull his car around. He just went straight. You can never know who’s driving, if someone pulls up next to you and says they’re going to go to work tomorrow.”\n“Three hours later, we found ourselves behind the wheel of the car, and there were just these strange conversations, people that were passing across our road. The driver was later joined by another driver. He told us he had no idea where he was and tried to get into the car, in case the person bumped off him. We didn’t hear a thing from him until after the police came. And then another driver we did contact the day before did come back and tell us to leave the site. Apparently his deputy had caught him smoking when they were there. We were then, and sadly, it appears that the sergeant took charge and found him at the bottom of the road just in time to end the ride.”\n']"

Some are much more celebratory than others, the kind of way we will express ourselves. This was the case this week for one Baltimore teen known as the “Hailey Connect” or “Hailey Connect”, who had this to say about his mother being her “street daughter”.\nI don’t know what my mother knew about Hailey Connect this week. I assume she was not really into her youngest son when I first met her and looked like something out of an Alfred Hitchcock film. Then her life changed completely.\nHailey was apparently constantly lonely. I knew she was always making make do with stuff she’d stolen from her parents and yelling at us. I wondered if this was a sign Hailey was really done dealing with her love life. Yes! A generation has caught up to the heavy lifting of raising kids who have left her face, no matter how sad she is doing.\nI didn’t know if she had into drugs, something that would eventually get her through the school resource officer (SRO) when she was in her twenties, then around 24. I didn’t know this the way we did, until I read one article in the Times about her and her unnamed mom. That was last week.\nWe can never have enough of that, just ask Hailey. Maybe her childmind did something that helped make her life better. She chose the brighter side, one that gave her what’s left after a night of “weiner sex”. He thought his former girlfriend was “assigned” to whatever service Hailey was up to. Hailey did exactly what he wanted. She told his mother, no less, that a girl has started to make the mistake of looking at her life like a bad move.\nHe wants to keep it as clean and happy as he can, and I don’t know what else can he do to stop the mess we can make. You can’t get much cleaner with Hailey Connect, and Hailey’s behavior bodes poorly for that next chapter in her life.\nwww.z3qpc.com/?utm_source=newsz utm_medium=news\n']"
1125,US politics,"['Kicked at the doorsteps of his political opponents, old-time liberal Andrew J. Whyte swore in an administrative assistant who promptly dismissed the young senator and petitioned the Supreme Court to protect the Constitution under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\nSo the conservative supporters of Obamacare relented, and basically rooted their Republican leadership in the region’s worst financial crisis since 1929, despite the Koch-backed base’s widespread support.\nWhyte, a libertarian, is the prime minister of Israel, a country that the USA has already fallen into a deep recession and that is heavily dependent on government.\nThis rhetoric was but enough to break the dearth of candidates this cycle, only a few of whom were senior senators, senators or members of Congress. Last year’s primaries were smaller, more ideologically motivated ones that flipped leaders in the battleground states they were home to or, since then, to former President Barack Obama and for Bill Clinton.\nThe issue is that the country has in some way contributed to its current dysfunction. Serious discussions in Washington fail to recognize the stakes. We’re essentially governed by a small group of ideologues. They insist on what they’re not responsible for, but we just don’t get it.\nThe practice of electing members by party and engaging with the president to advance their agenda tells us too little about how we should deal with a matter of responsibility.\nDoing nothing causes government leaders to think twice. President Trump has muzzled his chief of staff, Jared Kushner, who takes personal responsibility for the president’s actions, and repeatedly publicly committed the nation’s worst national security policy failure to the wrong people.\nDoing nothing is government’s method of pursuing a domestic agenda and working to fix that system. The borders of the country are porous and our enemies treat us as enemies with reckless abandon. Our ability to control the powerful and avoid crisis and disaster is at stake, and with that comes political accountability.\nThe biggest financial crisis of our time has nothing to do with the system, nothing to do with collective brinksmanship, nothing to do with political gamesmanship between lobbyists and politicians. It’s all about the resulting spiraling public debt and the massive waste and fraud we produce in government.\nKeep in mind, however, that the problem is not personnel. It’s wealth. As an economist and former professor, I know how to demonstrate in recent years how good it is to put all our people in a place that can make money. Too many folks don’t know how much they’re earning. We’re not seeing the impact of the trickle-down wealth effect.\nThat’s what tax reform was all about, and tax reform has instead been the result of a triage and a triage exercise. Social Security and Medicare are largely overfunded, and nobody understands how each can account for all that means.\nWe need to address those problems to raise revenue and produce more services. So now and then we have a president who doesn’t care about the policies he’s implementing, and then a leader who doesn’t understand what the problem really is.\nIf we elect more Republicans and progressives, we’ll see how the system works for decades to come. A blessedly-hearted Congress and the citizens who faithfully vote for the constitution’s supreme court should share some responsibility.\n']"

1127,Explainers,"['Dear Abby: I’m a tech user who uses the Internet to locate my family, to make a slideshow and a website and to keep track of current trends. Sometimes I turn off the normal functions when I’m off the Internet. My oldest baby is in her toddler bed, and I haven’t been to the doctor (thankfully there are always relatives at all times), which is a huge deal.\nIt is good to get started and I am. My husband is a career professional at large, so can I really manage one task? I have one son who likes to pick something up every once in a while. I have even enjoyed picking up pizza during lazy hours.\nThis house, really, is going to grow. How am I going to do this?\n— Reckless\nDear Reckless: You can, however, focus on one thing and then send your family a food collection and throw it away. You will need to talk to your kids about the things they like and have someone else know which button is left off the new “cooks” menu, and what menu items are in your recipe.\nA lot of times, when you start giving your family items to the food trust, which must have the ability to put them in fresh food boxes, it makes some food collectible. Some families are more sensitive to the food you give them, and most packages don’t contain any animals or other dangerous ingredients.\nNot all food trust products use artificial ingredients. With the advent of artificial ingredients, no amount of artificial food can contain animal or animal animal parts — far fewer than people can stomach the concern and suggest. And not all food trust products do taste good, either.\nIf I were to decide to buy an allergy-friendly meal, I’d take out all the additives I know how to select and pick a flavor, plant and germ of my choice that fits my family’s taste. I have options, but I keep the latter up to date with any allergens or ingredients (and let the idea run its course to some extent.)\nDear Abby: If you see your husband every night if you are at home and others are more busy, you can sleep-deprived and get upset. You don’t want to pay attention to what he is doing, or you don’t want to create a separation from your children. We have a couple of siblings in our household and we call each other for extra people. Do you really want to keep that alive? If your kids are living with you, do you want to be a life partner who gives you time for your family life?\n— Decent in Waukesha\nDear Decent: I don’t want to provide that satisfaction to those you live with. Whatever your comfort level is, make a list of people you share your concern with and you will be feeling sympathy for others.\nKnow that if you can’t see your spouse anytime soon, give them one eye. They are more likely to visit them on the Internet and drink beverages instead of getting up in the morning to go to work. They might also ask you, “What are you doing this weekend?” They might ask, “What’s going on right now?” You will want to go over the same list of options with your children. And if they are angry, explain in a short email that you are trying to leave them and take care of them to get over that.\nWhatever you do, please let them know you love them and believe you will use them very carefully. If they have trouble sleeping, leave them at home.\n— Fertility Detox & Recovery Center\nDear Fertility Detox: It sounds like you’re miffed the way women complain about toxic chemicals like e.g. Hydroxynovas’s oxymoron, U.S. EPA’s reactive oxygen species, etc. I don’t know how to relate to such anger because I’m a 20-something wife and a 24-year-old mother.\nBut you truly think we should “move to sanctity.” Of course, you are not the reason why every one of you’s kids gets kicked off the school bus to get to school. What are you going to do?\nDear Abby: I’m tired of repeated unwanted pregnancy. Every time I think a pregnant person should have waited until a certain age before they got pregnant, I say, “They are!

1128,Inside Wuhan: Watching my wife get coronavirus,"['Our 11-year-old daughter, Anna, recently got word that there was a serious virus in her blood.\nToday she and her sister, Ariana, are recovering at home.\nWe are trying to make sure all is well. She suffered a head-on injury and scratch. But we’re still dealing with ice, since what is the impact on the milk and the mice? After what she was having like that I was going to reach for the X, and remember this X, it will likely trip me up and break my neck.\nNone of this is to say we can’t get better, but the symptoms of coronavirus are intermittent, and often will be very severe. Of course, sometimes people will get in contact with people who are infected, and they can experience viral diseases such as strep throat and black lung disease. There is no specific protocol for who might be infected, but it’s becoming obvious that there’s a risk among homeowners, as the CVS and supermarket chains will be notified and associated labs will be checked to see if there are other health issues.\nThe worst case of the infection is the child getting infected on the truck after her mother stopped breathing or a little blood was coming out of her nostrils. Then of course there is the need for everyone to go home, including everyone in the family, to get tested. It’s very worrying. If that happens, then perhaps this is something you can’t stay away from, especially with the way it’s spread.\nThis is the second time in a week that I’ve had my 17-year-old daughter fall ill, and this time my daughter has gotten really severe. She was traveling, and was visiting a cousin, who had some family problems.\nNaloxone can save a child’s life by getting them as close to a roll of smoke as possible, which might, in my opinion, be more effective. But it will probably take several thousand dollars, and then, unfortunately, I did something terribly stupid. They made a dangerous crackin one day, and it wasn’t fentanyl. It killed you.\nI have proof. According to the CDC, there have been 1,322 deaths from the very serious coronavirus in its lifetime (2001-2015).\nThe toll is even higher, from 100 babies to 120 adults, and you can’t trust vaccine manufacturers when it comes to the nasty side of it. The percentages of people who get the virus, and perhaps some people who get it in themselves, might not seem quite as high. But it could be a higher number, or it could be that it is just extremely rare. There are statistics which make you think of another causality or another being a vaccine potential.\nOne thing I’ve seen over the years is there are fewer veteran people that have been vaccinated, which probably explains the lower death rates. There may be high rates of antibodies to various viruses.\nBut an increasing number of people actually have copies of the virus that replicate and spread. Therefore, it’s much more likely that the virus is going to be spread via the use of smuggled or pirated water, or bacterial paste, or sex. At the risk of upsetting these experts, it is understandable that this is just an example of how viral diseases work. There is definitely a vaccine against such viruses, and the fact that there are many more of them means that they can be accurately identified.\nWith the money spent to fight Ebola, it is now worth it for anyone to think about screening in their community for the ""superbug"" virus as well as the other viruses that have been prevalent across the US and Europe.\nI’m so impressed by the fact that the CDC has let millions of people know about who really gets the infection and who is not so susceptible. Hopefully that’s happening soon, but my hope is that at some point, there will be another round of discussions for many people to consider who may or may not be infected. Not to scare them, but to educate them.\n']"

The cabins on the trolley were missing: the mink furrows at the front.\nPeople squirmed and swayed as the train came by, like an egg underneath a jigsaw puzzle. It only required pausing for 10 minutes. There was a final standing ovation in the crowds, if not the cute ones cheering at the end of the carriages with their wayward son hovering over the line.\nThe cabins were empty, except for the one chosen for a royal wedding. For the twinkle lights. They were abandoned, abandoned again, perhaps because something breathtaking had taken place at the XE Planetarium of England.\nLast year was hairy for the BBC, so it decided to take its power-flipping over to the National Trust’s website (donning red alert trims required from the BBC!) and put its first deployment online on Saturday and Sunday, allowing them to register as a special “other click” over the weekend.\nIt found that 1.7 million people couldn’t register, which usually tells us quite a lot about the letters and numbers under the windows, but this was a device that persuaded people to join the online history of government. The most famous sitar, Reza Aslan, who is mentioned in the original poem, is the also-rans.\n“After watching the final say on the bridge, I was struck by the number of people who had not arrived as individuals before, during or after, the giant singing chorus of the Palace,” said Caroline Franklin, the artistic director of the National Trust.\nThe space-damaged platform, along with a spooky scene of A Star Is Born, have become one of the unofficial sites of a major Queen Elizabeth II trip to London.\n“Everything the monarch did from her inaugural in February 1977 to her life as a British monarch, from her rise to power to her legacy has gone on display in Buckingham Palace, among many, many media outlets,” Franklin said.\nThe Queen’s exploits have become far more significant than each other. In 2010 she commanded headlines that people largely saw as election promises — that the Queen would not challenge British rule. She was John Major’s shadow chancellor.\nIn 2011, her husband Prince Philip was unexpectedly elected to the premiership as caretaker leader. The scandal sparked a global search for a successor and inspired the London Evening Standard to launch a campaign for the Queen’s deputy, Winston Churchill.\nShe kept her distance from Churchill, but two years later she called him to present a memorial rock — a reluctant but suitable ship.\nOn the trolley, she met composer Freddie Flintoff, whose three different fiddle CDs devoted to her received greater attention than a number of pop stars, namely Elton John.\nDespite the slow pace of the new season, the Queen was thoughtful in her respects when describing people on her private plane. (“I really mean it; there’s not a lot to talk about.”)\nI liked his singing, his manner of speaking, especially if he seemed to escape London’s damp sun and warm mornings. She had seen the success of “Annie Get Your Gun” in 1937 and explained: “I knew that it is a wonderful story, and I never forgot it, but it was not a big story for me, because it did not involve any young men.”\nThis year seemed to be the follow-up to that remark and one that had moved for the best part of three years.\nThe Silver Jubilee helped galvanize attention and anticipation. There were no champagne parties celebrating, thank-you dances and best-of-the-scamp telly renditions.\nAlso over the weekend: Father-of-three Scottish businessman Gordon Brown has visited London for his 11th time in this capacity, where he will be duking it out with the Queen on the Queen’s estate.\nLike the coach driver, he will bring the efficiency and the buzz, to hum a song.\n']"

1137,BBC News,"['Good morning, you. Some of the UK\'s best-known news organisations are pulling out of the Channel 4 news ratings table.\nBBC News, the flagship British news organisation, has announced this morning that the ratings service will no longer be automatically showing for BBC News on weekends.\nCommenting on the decision, BBC News chief executive Richard Bronfman said:\n“The BBC is committed to a dynamic public service and continuing the focus on the exceptional work that we do. For a 12-month period, Channel 4 News would have operated on the Sunday. I believe this decision allows us to deliver great news at such a important time, and we are going to do the best we can to keep it running as we always have done. “Over the last 12 months, we have enjoyed a strong investment in the BBC, including the closure of the Sunday Newsnight desk, further investment in the programming library and the renovation of the studio. “Tonight our audience is watching around the clock and today\'s announcement is well timed to reach out to them.”\nThe move was condemned as a ""rough negotiating tactic"", while The Hollywood Reporter called it ""disgraceful"", adding that ""executives taking such a macho approach should be ashamed"" of how ""news organisations are sometimes described as a fine-tuned approach"" to managing news.""\nIn addition to the viewing figures that the BBC News title has fallen from, it is blamed by advertisers for decreasing ratings from the end of 2015.\nThree years ago advertisers attributed The Press Times\'s peak TV ad spending to The Penjames debacle. One of its advertisers said it was not surprising that advertisers were not interested in the podcast show.\nFired as a comment on technology journalism earlier this year, only a quarter of the staff of Project Comic are now in an advertising director position at the BBC.\nEight out of 10 BBC journalists working on the BBC website are unpaid.\nThe BBC Network and PC World are down to six in a row. The Corporation\'s Network Media Group CEO, Ronnie Mustard, told journalists in London this morning:\n""This is the worst week of half a century for BBC One. BBC One is not going to be anywhere near what Channel 4 did during that time. There are other things in the way of doing that are probably the most important things.""\nChristian Eyre, head of corporate communications at the BBC Worldwide, said he ""can\'t remember the last day at a company in this terrible blow to the BBC and BBC Worldwide.""\nHe added that the news organisation\'s online operation – which reaches 18.9 million people – would shut down ""soon"", before the holidays.\nA spokesman for YouTube also confirmed the web giant would stop responding to what would be dealt with by it.\n']"

1139,Reality Check,"['To say that the era of digital lying and manipulation and loss of privacy is over in the US and there is indeed something truly unsettling in the wake of 2017 is like saying that is not the era of lies and manipulation, but that 2017, 2018 and 2019 are going to be the years of untold brain damage and chronic indifference that lie has seen in almost every important US government,” said Ady Gildal, executive director of the ACLU’s Institute on Cybersecurity.\n“No one asks for special treatment, or any criticism from government employees, but in that case, the public has no opinion of a government entity to simply trust,” she said.\nSo whether you agree with, disagree, or share what it is that has been bad in your life, here are some of the things that you should be looking at today.\n1. Text you you don’t want on Facebook\nAnyone (anyone with a smartphone) can get on Facebook, all the time, and get help looking for problems, or problems when they don’t really like you. If your bad judgment is known to anyone, what happens is that one mistake is another but an even more dangerous one, when it comes to regulating your behavior on social media.\n2. Speaking in other people’s language\nFor some, learning a different language could be a new lesson in living your whole life without someone believing in it. However, this often brings with it difficult communication skills, and some users are learning English while abroad as well.\n3. Embracing the “engagement required” mindset\nOpinions on particular topics can be either irrational or deliberately chosen in order to divide the conversation. However, when you think about it, of course, people might not realize just how active social media allows us to be.\n4. Spreading lies and disinformation\nFailed or participating in deception may appear politically and with one breath, on paper, and that translates into information that requires misinformation or disinformation to be produced in an effective manner. However, fake news is also misleading and harmful. For example, in many countries, disinformation is considered either by the media’s professional standards or by the public, or, if one is inclined to classify it as public, it is termed dishonest propaganda, which is a mixture of false and misleading propaganda.\n5. How to get in front of public opinion\nWhen all the arguments and opinions of our politicians make it to the main presentation, we give it weight, right? Wrong.\nWhether you’re a person who follows opposing candidates, a political office holder, or an unexpected statement on news, it is more than usually necessary to start quickly, don’t wait and see public opinion and make a decision to get involved with the fight or decide who gets in front of the polls.\nThis is the kind of conversation that could ultimately lead to positive developments for the public to take risks in what they want to do on social media and develop their opinions.\nThe Executive Director of ACLU’s Institute on Cybersecurity said the following:\n“Over the last twenty years, our society has been forced to turn to the digital digital reality for ways to effectively handle complex information for certain countries, when they would rather resort to reporting and distortion than engaging with the facts. With nearly every social change, at least part of the public backlash against such disinformation has been driven by the release of false, troubling and highly damaging information. We can expect many more false and misleading propaganda campaigns that expand to undermine trust in information and the value of information, when there is no time or place for those who disseminate it.”\n6. Understanding how to deflect falsehoods from one another\nGood news, bad news, and worse lies can pile up online, and undermine trust in the communication infrastructure to communicate with each other and with the world at large.\nWhat if you were to one day want to take a step in the other direction? Would it be interesting to help in this area? How would you do it?\n***\nCybersecurity and Privacy of Governments have always been different. However, if the US privacy beleaguered by this dynamic is it, then its case needs to be taken more seriously to grasp how our government, like, for that matter, could harm the public.\nWe urge a mutually beneficial relationship.\n']"

China is always in favor of developing infrastructure to combat China.""\nChina\'s state-run Xinhua, for example, ""cannot give any more weight to criticizing the United States than do the U.S. government.""\nThen, last week, the State Department reversed its decision to be the first U.S. government department not to back an initiative to promote South Asian patriotism.\n""President Xi has told South Korean officials that he would send an official to South Korea on Monday. South Korean national security officials who are involved in the recruitment of South Korean people for the one-time attempt, but who are oblivious to the gravity of this work, are strongly opposed to the U.S.\'s attempt to persuade international nations of its commitment to South Korea,"" the State Department said in a blogpost announcing the change.\n""The U.S. has issued a new directive that states that these efforts are not permissible against international peaceful resolution, transparency, or national security interest.""\nBut, there has been no official announcement of that change, leaving the U.S. statement in limbo.\nMingbo Kim, a 26-year-old American from San Francisco, uses the English language version of World of Warcraft to describe the propaganda effort.\nHe writes, ""The goal of this place is to start a better wars. It starts with the non-sensations and wars, so big money makes the process of collecting propaganda and propaganda so stupid that it doesn\'t even take more than two hours to make up propaganda.""\nKim adds that whenever the Newsroom, which has already culled a dozen people, features a foreign-language correspondent in Asia, the ""adverse implication is always the opposite: he is going to go on with a massive propaganda campaign to persuade the masses that there is no path to freedom, either from China or from Russia.""\nBut the Newsroom already has worked with numerous Chinese media outlets to create visuals for the story.\nIf there is one thing leading up to Tuesday\'s PM story, it is China.\nAnd if the chorus persists, a Twitter hashtag will break the Newsroom.\nBut the fact remains: The amount of content American fans are demanding is such that it will be hard for a figure of some stature to challenge.\nEach of us has ties to the web. Some CNN and Fox News anchor would certainly benefit from them.\nAnd if the U.S. government eventually decides that how we use our information information, as it does with CBS\'s Tony Fisicco in his writings about the Pentagon Papers, should be different from what\'s going on abroad, there will be no more hints on how long it might take to get out of the closet.\nSo, across the country, they will be happy to hear this story will end.\n']"

The amount it would be introduced to, the amount it would be levied and the percentage increase are present.\nThe tax rate for diesel vehicles in the state of Kerala has more than doubled to 5.1 per cent. To boost revenue stream and therefore the whole economy, the 2.5 per cent new diesel motor vehicle excise tax received in 2018 has been increased to 9.8 per cent.\nThe diesel motor vehicle excise tax was double to 6.7 per cent last year, and the income tax on petrol vehicles increased to 2.5 per cent from 4.3 per cent a year ago. This helps in generating more revenues for the state government.\nTurning to the income tax, income tax has been increased to 20 per cent from 18 per cent and the income tax on sugarcane and cane processing in Wanchadri district has been increased from 5 per cent to 20 per cent and sugar production has also increased from 5.4 per cent to 6.7 per cent.

1143,Long Reads,"['Long Reads\nMonday, April 7, 2018\nIf it’s a recipe that’s not in itself a cookbook, perhaps a recent visit with the cook on wheels gives you an idea of how much you can actually learn about cooking and cooking basics. What’s yet to be determined is whether it’s “cookbooks,” or just a compilation of your favorite quick and easy dinners. Sorry, there are some recipes that you can’t find on Google to make your kitchen better. But so far, many of them are small in scale.\ni. Amaze me with baking candies, mummies and sticky rice. Okay, so it was just candy to be made, right? It was sure to happen! Or it could be because I’m addicted to it. You all know how it is. The best-selling bottled magnum cognac ($25) is released today, with no mention of the ingredients. This one just beat the authenticity award at the Oscars.\nTweet cookies with salad, make with beef, mashed potatoes, grapes and vegetables. They don’t much use juice or sugar, but they are still a great time. This one is a cute idea, so cookable if you’re not a big fan of the science fiction genre.\nBread and eggs cracker with pasta. For breakfast, you’ll need lots of butter and olive oil; plenty of flour; and plenty of extra virgin olive oil. And the “wood” kind of idea: 1 (O) pound dry bread to break up the sugary flour. All of the key ingredients can be made into a tough, sharp thick bread for breakfast. Besides baking, you can get homemade muffins in the box.\nMaster the art of french toast with broccoli, carrots, onions and parsley. They don’t have such things as the right amount of salt. Sheer butter? Which is a shame, given how wonderful this one is.\nSweets with black beans, rice and noodles.

On a lightly floured surface, brush the chicken broth with the remaining ingredients. Stir in the broccoli, mushrooms, parsley, cumin, cinnamon, and/or cumin into the broth. Set aside.\n2. Muddle all the onion and zucchini seeds with the bread. Drizzle in the remaining ingredients. Top with prepared flour and sprinkle with sugar, stirring until all the bread is browned and all the zucchini is tender. Cover and refrigerate at least an hour.\n3. Skim 1/4 cup white wine vinegar from the jar for finishing. Sprinkle over the other vinegar, and spoon the remaining vinegar into the chilled serving bowl. Pour the vinegar over the bread and sprinkle over the remaining wine. Discard the vinegar and smooth, cover and refrigerate for at least an hour.\n4. Cream the butter and lemon juice together in a large bowl. Mix in the egg wash. Turn the sauce over and add all the balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper. Pour about 1/2 cup of the white wine over the flour mixture. Season the bread with the remaining vinegar. Taste and add more.\n5. Add 1/4 cup of the bacon to the sauce, topping with the egg wash. Strain and drizzle in the orange juice. Season with 2 tablespoons more of the sugar and blend to coat. Serve with the batter.\nNote:\nPrepare slow cooker for serving.

1144,Have Your Say,"['The outbursts over the last weekend have only heightened the illusory sense of freedom we have as a people—and the self-importance we have toward the rest of us.\nOur sense of ourselves as being real somehow deteriorates as a human being, and yet, we crave anything. We shower on mountains, shower on alligators, shower on bears, shower on alligators. We put on makeup that makes us look totally ordinary. We pose with our hands in ungodly positions, take our shower. We hardly ever have time to think about life or our everyday practices, or say how we, at the end of the day, are most likely feeling our feelings. These thoughts contain enormous generality to our conscious existence, and they\'ve been presented in ways almost as absurdly as we see any human being do. I\'ve written some diatribes (research for some time and I\'m still humming) on this subject, but never a fear of what one might say. Feelings of being right, and being wrong or wrong do occasionally influence other, more fundamental terms, and still, they hurt and hurt people. No surprise that most people I know behave in similar ways. We, the people we love in our own skin, have these thoughts, opinions, and we are often convinced that whatever we say must be right.\nWhere, in this? In our own selves, the more ideas we blur to ourselves about life, the more everyday we feel judged, hurt, and hurt ourselves. And the less we celebrate and celebrate the freedom we have into existence, the more we get resentful that not just is there pleasure in a sense. Try to say, ""This is just making you unhappy, and is that the ordinary thing?""\nIt\'s easy to point and show a box of labels. It\'s hard to say, ""Why is everything in its own fashion?""\nOne person--this person\'s opinion--can explain the things that don\'t differ drastically from others. Others can consider that, too.\nIf so, surely we can end up doing the same work.\nSome people insist, ""I don\'t care. Don\'t fret."" Others need to make this clear. We grow up and move in different, and different, ways. We\'re raised in different, disparate, varied, repetitive ways.\nSome people change. Others aren\'t changed at all.\nWhy am I alive? We understand we\'re different. Let\'s change some of these differences by restructuring them for more equal things.\nThis also may be the most important way to sum up the journey, which I\'m very pleased I\'ve had the chance to explore. If you\'re, in any way, not being different, why are we different? We\'re all different, but we\'re a racial group, a sexual group, and life -- the underlying components of all of our differences. For instance, I\'m different for a different reason. There are times when I feel like I\'m being drastically different from my colleagues. For instance, I think a black person has very very high IQ, but statistically black people outperform white people in IQ. So, the difference is clearly a good thing for me. But how do I keep myself moving forward in the way I\'m moving forward?\nIf you\'re not changing at all, just hear me out, and not just in your front yard or the movies you were watching last week.\nDo you recognize your real self?\n']"

He was also featured in the 2005 documentary, about the Madeleine “Doria de Filje” she died at the age of 49.\nAnnounced in 2014, the recording of Moulin Rouge’s “Prince,” which was choreographed by Richie Sambora, is scheduled to bow for U.S. television in “Latin America & Caribbean” and is set to last until spring 2020.\nAnother Latin American hit sung by The Inter?A, along with “Talpaa,” from The Well Goer Band, is currently airing on BET’s “The Bachelorette,” which celebrates its 30th season.\nTitled “Woman of the Clouds,” from Maria Carrera’s book or biography on poet Fusamo Aspas, “Woman of the Clouds” is a collection of five stories, some written in 45 years and others done in 33 years. It recounts the life of the female protagonist, “a man who pursues women for the life he believes.”\nThe film follows the development of four new queens ― Teresa de Los Santos (Luis Salazar), Maria Alicia Marin (Katrina Wolter) and Reina Normancia (Luis Cruz). Each brings a woman or girl to him and on their own terms, choosing one beautiful woman over another and her work. When the trio is split into three, it seems they may keep their individual identities. However, in a swipe at King Drosselmeyer, it also reveals who united the women of Econando, the queenical “Mother of the Clouds,” who prefers the princesses of the Spanish empire, but with a different personality and ability than the one he considers the enemy.\nTitled “Palacio de Domico,” the song is released today. It features a swirling sound by Miguel Rios, who is also featured in the documentary, along with the cast of “Courteurs,” whose singer Rodrigo Castro plays the role of Diego, the king of Colombia.\nIn Pedro Martinez de las Flores, first performed as a teenager with Dancing Queen, the singers tackle the blues, funk and rock, which they join in the film.

1150,Middle East,"['If you think the Arab Spring is going to be an Islamist coup, you’re naive.\nYou’ve seen Egypt. After both there and in the Middle East all of the political hubbub and passionate rhetoric involved in the recent uprising, the revolution that began in Tunisia has led to anti-American demonstrations in key Arab countries. And now Afghanistan.\nWe’ve seen revolutions elsewhere. Western and Arab governments were trying to put an end to the Arab Spring by basically letting dictators fire down what is now a relatively stable version of democracy in some of the Middle East’s most traditionally Arab nations. A losing battle.\nUnlike Pakistan and Egypt, they have a weak civilian government and have little effective counterterrorism operations. But they have a radical Islamist president. There are reports of violent riots here and in the Far East, yet neither has a formal government.\nThe remnants of Zaynab, the 15-year-old Muslim dictator the autocrat-turned-Saudi-made Taliban, have become a powerful force in the Arab world.\nMany are opposed to NATO and Russia’s plans to join the United States in Afghanistan in 2010. There are examples of how countries with general sympathy for the rebels are becoming to radical Islamic movements: Turkmenistan, Lebanon, Libya and Syria.\nIn Iran, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard announced it would overthrow the government of President Hassan Rouhani in June.\nMeanwhile, in Egypt, there is an emerging consensus that Mubarak might be the last government of the people that can take out the infighting.\nShiite militiamen loyal to Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi have put fire before the men who have built the strong institutions of Egypt’s Arab Spring movement. Most of them want to see Mubarak go.\nIn Egypt, they’re calling for elections in the country next spring. The new president’s supporters have already set up teams to bring a new opposition to power.\nIn Tunisia, now a secular movement, thousands of protesters marched from police cells in Tunis City to Tahrir Square to demand an end to the eight-year dictatorship of Ben Ali, dictator for 24 years.\nSomalia, the cradle of the Arab Spring, and Syria, are making this long-overdue push.\nPresident Mohamed Morsi, the head of the Muslim Brotherhood, who has lost every day since taking power, has pursued his program of regime change in Egypt for nearly a year. By doing so, he has rebranded an Islamist party that was a bad fit for a Muslim Brotherhood movement, and which has had its head burned in a fire sparked by the repression of peaceful protests.\nSo, the Egyptians are preparing to take back the streets.\nAt the same time, though, the oppression of the Muslim Brotherhood has taken up the work of Germany’s SPD, Italy’s Alt-Right and much of the rest of Europe. They’re all trying to harness the almighty royalist forces, especially Israel, in Europe’s Middle East and Africa.\nThere are regional theories. With the United States agreeing to provide $33 billion in ground troops to make sure that Iraq gets its fighting forces and is held together, a choice on which Christians would seek to make the war more difficult for Israel.\nThe American-based neoconservatives were actively trying to bring about an independent Iran, but these people realize that the danger is there in one faction acting out the other in an effort to sabotage the diplomacy in Vienna.\nThey may be putting their own spin on this all too well. But the public of the United States, friends, and allies of Israel, still does.\nThis is also an old narrative — Western and Arab versions of popular revolutions.\n(Trip Hariri is a political columnist in Beirut, Lebanon, and author of War on Revolution: Inside Iran’s Political Divide.)\n']"

1155,Local News,"['Like No. 8 in the Upper Midwest or 8 in the Big Smoke,\nBrown and Helder bring the political issue to life in the most entertaining way: by portraying a freewheeling conservative man in the cat’s cradle of heat, a GOP Governor, and his agency have given up the fight, and they’ve gone to war with the Republicans over Medicaid.\nHere is the definition of “political” from the CBC:\nMadstreamism distorts reality\nThe media’s delusion that “life has a silver lining,” in the minds of some people, is a poisoned illusion. Most people already know in advance that Democrats are in fact out to destroy the GOP, only to see the opposition be obliterated, the Republic went to war, the Republicans took control of Congress.\n“Enough with the Republicans, Democrats” is one of the suggestions they were, behind closed doors, after 2 years of negotiation, in a disingenuous media warfare that’s now a two-way affair. Maybe that was the motivation, or maybe even our reluctance to believe the errors of omission, in the Democratic Party’s political acumen. But we all knew there would be plenty of media fodder for virtually every positive comment in the media’s breathless coverage of the marriage issue, and the crimes of much worse candidates. The celebrated “bloggers,” and the blogosphere’s stars who blogged and liked—beyond the dynastic presence of some Obama or Romney campaign figure—are nothing short of name proof. They are there to impress the world in the advertising medium and economic marketplace, such as humor (the kind of conversation at home we can keep up with on the internet or on the television), understanding the truth, and the weak voice, the inaction, of things the likes of Biden and Pelosi “show us the flag.”\nFrom Michael Savage’s microtargeting campaign to the negative drumbeat of his forthcoming book “Outnumbered”—which includes ridiculous claims like “it’s a huge mistake for a prospective marriage to be a repeat attack ad against gays”—social conservatives have become the pushback squads in the nation’s news, partly because of the usual procrastination and indecision when it comes to meaningful debate. People are antsy to see signs that a television show is really going to lose its audience because of ugly comments and hate speech.\nRather than us, the appearance of the very real racism in the White House has been castigated as being a Republican flash-fire of some sort. I know that hardly anyone lives for this kind of optics. I learned that this week. While there are some videos showing Okeechobee’s antics—his lawyer and even his wife (he has), as well as videos of the “great” CEO Sean O’Kelly, rocking his infant son—will likely affect, I don’t foresee a widespread bad press of this nature from the media. That doesn’t mean that he’s not pulling a series of big laughs. But there’s more than a few conservatives who think these cartoons (of deep-state bogeymen dressed up as artists) really represent a cross-section of Democrats, who believe the whole reason to oppose any President is due to the way they manipulate the public and our democratic process.\nAs if that was not enough reason enough for the media to go too far in sticking with a fictional man in the cat’s cradle of heat. Anyone with a TV show will tell you “dodgy” commercials and television has been a whipping game all of their lives, and anyone with the electricity to hear you beat the Republicans in the race will tell you you truly hate media. If they once watched a disaster of a presidential campaign and only got to see what was real, with results, and then allow you to watch that, you’ll know they didn’t really care about the victims, the media’s phony excuse for being responsible, and about the causes of the violence in the enemy zone.\n']"
1156,Market Data,"['Today is an opportune time to assess the market potential in retirement, and examine the data to determine whether 401(k) and FSA schemes can provide sound and sustainable long-term growth prospects for Americans over 65. The reasons should not be ignored. The vast majority of retirement plan assets are invested in very safe and liquid U.S. high-yield securities, ETFs and mutual funds. The IRA and 401(k) platform is robustly backed by numerous investment firms, including a significant amount of money raised through existing investors. The SEC has created an SEC that better governs the market, and ""clean"" entities are a natural part of the industry.\nAs the Investing Voice points out, 401(k) and FSA funds are complex and can be invested in any asset class, whether through what are known as ""standard, super or universal"" methods, such as an index, sub-indexing or broad index funds.\nRecalling the advantages of utilizing investments in leading-edge quantitative products can be one of the best ways to create a better investment proposition. Information and tools from Vanguard and Schwab tend to be the biggest advantage.\nWhen you consider the three most popular mutual funds (NYSEARCA:SPY, XLM, EFA and EDX) all invest in equities, you can see how investing in equities has certainly played a large role in improving returns in the past.

1157,Global Trade,"['Last Monday I was just checking on my bank account at the bank when it suddenly came together, that the speech they were setting out to tell us America’s position on trade was enough to trigger that initial bubble & crash and send it crashing into the abyss of oblivion. Today, the speech that Trump has just released was remarkably easy. It contained a lot more about what the government is doing to rein in importation and backloading of domestic products from the United States into Canada, Mexico and Australia. But it was equally stunning that it focused on what it called “Protectionism.” The first provision of the speech mentioned nothing that was obvious about what actually means: the protectionist measures the US government was facing as a result of its trade relationship with the vast majority of the world’s non-US companies. For example, all American content must be imported from third countries. (These aren’t the same firms, and they’re not as old as other nations, but less so.) Other imports must first come with WTO obligations. (In some cases, these can be as good as anti-Vietnamizing restrictions – after all, those put in place to curb Vietnam’s influence in the region.) What the US tried to do, and failed to do, is to double-down on its manufacturing and transportation industries and create barriers that effectively will bring back American jobs.\nYet, while this phrase was hard to dislike, the approach of the speech has all of the aspects where the administration would like it to do things differently, but it does nothing to make those things the clearest guides for fixing the problem, i.e. by slashing tariffs, eliminating subsidies on American products and manufacturing, or making American supply chains work together with local and international businesses. It just won’t. And, in the end, it will be too much of a boon to the $100 trillion manufacturing sector: it will feed anti-competitive efforts in China and elsewhere (not only in the US but also in Europe and North America) as well as to embarrass Canada (and Europe and the United States) in a comprehensive trade agreement.\n']"
1158,Companies,"['Good news, folks. Corporate cash has settled into half-a-billion dollars, an astonishing $60 billion that’s spent by people and corporations on technology, publishing software, and other projects over the past year or so. Over $8 billion of it has been on things like drones, telemedicine, and other new, internet-based, social, data-driven ventures. And it’s more of the same.\nAccording to financial data firm Bloomberg News, 836 companies that use the latest in information technology—including over $7.2 billion in profit—reported corporate operating cash flows of at least $5 billion in 2016, with a yoyy 10.2 percent decrease in those returns. The next-biggest growth spurt was the of $4.1 billion in mergers and acquisitions in 2015.\nRelated: 10 Reasons Why You Should Not Have Tried to Save the Dow!\nAnother notable difference between 2015 and 2018: The dollar value of the average of the top 100 companies fell 6.4 percent from 2014. Why, yes, some of these companies have paid out billions in cash to shareholders over the past year.\nSome, such as Starbucks, the world’s biggest coffee chain, haven’t even returned their promised stock, saying they had planned to stock it this year. But those demerits didn’t apply to the companies themselves. They make money either by delivering big product lists to customers or managing user interfaces, networking, utility tech, and other platforms, or by doing pretty much everything, from organizing business cards to managing data storage to integrating traditional enterprises.\nThe reason: With only $5 billion in revenue, you’d expect good things from any company. They show up in those top 10. Except some of them don’t. In fact, that’s more than 90 percent of all corporate cash flow has been spent in the past year, Bloomberg said.\nNo one’s going out with $50 notes today. No. 1. (And, n) No. 2. Not even eight. No. 3.\nI don’t suppose to call anyone an investor, but I’d bet you they’d prefer to just hold onto those dollar notes. Sure, the Dow is still down, but it seems like the lot of the people in these silly places is more happy than to sit around and wait for a tinker. Maybe a “Dow crashing again” rally led to a moment of cognitive dissonance. Maybe the dollar demand for the stock is more than its share price reflects, but at least the demand exists in that stock.

The world changes faster than ever before and everyone should be using technology to build their businesses. We know how to take on the big picture, but most successful companies still try to catch up in the current area.\nEvery enterprise must have an online presence. Many companies can afford to hire a consultant to scan the social networking sites. While this system lets many companies then use an in-house virtual salesforce, a small number have opted to use a privately owned website. This allows people to share directly with each other how their business operates. If a large company has the ability to hold events or purchases electronically, just ask any company.\nIf there is just one company with the ability to work on this common purpose, then companies should look for someone. In this business, most people look for job opportunities that include payroll or an accounting need.\nWhen doing this, it’s essential that these companies choose a person that has the technical knowledge and vision to be a good public relations consultant. If a company needs to invest in software, design and a sales force, then other companies should seek the most qualified candidates.\nTo be successful, businesses have to enable technology to better serve them.

1162,Global education,"['School has been an integral part of U.S. education for generations, and right now more and more high school grads are enrolled in both math and science, new data shows.\nBut what makes schools unique?\nWith the nation’s demographics changing rapidly, many schools just aren’t ready for the age of “fast learner,” or the new standard for college graduates.\nUniversity of Michigan researchers analyzed more than 16,000 college graduates from 1986 to 2013 to find out why each of those high school graduates actually went to college. About 72% of the high school graduates said they were probably at school in 2013, according to University of Michigan data.\nThough the estimate of these grads may seem high, it’s actually the same as “quick learner,” or children who had not graduated from school by four years, according to CNN Money.\n“Factors that predict a high school student’s likelihood of attending college to such degrees can be analysed using particular information from the survey,” said Dean Kirby, an associate professor of education at Michigan who led the research.\nThe findings come from a child- and adult-level assessment of more than 1,200 parents in a nationally representative sample of 1,957 public elementary and middle schools that Michigan surveyed.\nAbout 81% of the parents said they knew their child was going to college, while just 46% knew how many college students they wanted to see in their future, according to the report.\nOne major factor being used in determining how much can be taught in preschool and the next generation – listening to students — was the former.\nThe children born in 1990 now aged five to nine see the impact of FM by more than 6 million by age 10. The percentage of FM participants declines over time, but the study finds that the number of FM participants climbs during those years, based on a linked correlation between FM participants’ life spans and the fact that those living in the U.S. are more likely to be in school.\nPrevious study has linked FM participation to the health of students aged 10 to 14, but Kirby cautions that those odds are generally lower among older students. The long-term effects of FM were also assessed by examining the effects of attention deficits in elementary schools during the 1960s and early 1970s, as well as from early elementary education.\n“Approximately three-quarters of FM teachers surveyed reported that their students are well-behaved throughout their school days,” said Kirby. “An important part of this is how the students know they are learning from music and dance, with the last 12 to 17 years of the elementary education being designed to prepare young students for the new age of learning.”\nBut the thing’s different from the FM component, according to the authors, which asks students to memorize words or not remember important ones.\nAnother factor that will likely be studied at higher levels of education is the number of children who wait their entire life for them to succeed.\n“There are still many very early-childhood preschool students,” said Kirby. “They won’t have a mentor with them.

1163,Global Car Industry,"['Written by Folks on Fingertips\nI certainly don’t want to believe how ridiculous it is to have “transties” and other ideas by which everyone agrees. So let’s try to stop the auto industry (I don’t know if there are any things I wouldn’t like to read and point out) and the media (Znobs), and your idea of a global Car Industry.\nLet’s focus on the data and think for a minute. If Car sales were on a constant basis, whether it was Chrysler and General Motors selling cars on average rather than every other car type, the $13,000 to $40,000 price tag for a Chevrolet Suburban while SUV sales were among the lowest of any cars sold in the world, the market for automobiles was very small. In 2011, the market for cars was 2 million units, 19% bigger than in 2010. Even a decade ago, Sales of Sellers, Price Slows, or Miss Sales of High-Closed Vehicles was below that.\nFor example, in 2009, selling an S Class Cadillac Escalade for just $9,250 was considered “good news,” the consensus view, with the average selling price costing $20,000 to $21,000, and assuming the S averaged $7,000 more in 2011 the average selling price was $16,100 in 2011. In 2010, selling an S Class the average selling price was $29,530, and when it ended the year on a higher note the S.C. Department of Motor Vehicles realized it was “not enough” to increase the price because of a several thousand dollars increase in dealer inventories.\nFor a start, a good number of plants in the U.S. alone had over 2000 trucks produced in 2010. More importantly, in 2011 alone, this number increased to 1.9 million vehicles sold. That’s a 20% increase and 50% increase for the year ended on April 3. For comparison’s sake the number of over 2000 SUVs sold in the U.S. in 2011 was in the range of 11,000 to 11,600 cars.\nAccording to the Newscomon review of 2011 sales by discount site Edmunds, the American population lives on about $235,000 a year and is currently consuming 70% more household consumption than the general population. That consumption contributes to the 35% more annual expansion of U.S. food costs.\nAre you going to propose a global automobile industry? What’s your concept?\n']"

Biden endorsed Clinton four years later.\nBiden did not respond to the report, but a source close to the situation told CNN he was going to comment during the dinner. The source said Biden is familiar with Biden\'s ""brothers and sisters"" and has had longstanding relationships with the former two, but declined to comment further.\nChurches had strong support for Clinton over Obama, but the Obama era was marked by strife in the Republican Party.\nFormer Democratic House Speaker Newt Gingrich won a primary victory that May for his party\'s nomination.\nIt\'s unclear if the goal was to link Biden to Clinton, but it\'s safe to say it looks like he will have to overcome the Democratic wave.\nBiden\'s 2010 book, ""From a Crisis"" chronicles the tough 2011-2012 fall in 2010 as the U.S. faced an election season that saw increased foreign aid following the Arab Spring.\nThe book ultimately failed to boost Clinton\'s performance, so the debate was over whether the former vice president had the skills to deliver a message to a country that cared about shared prosperity and shared values.\nAccording to Clinton\'s campaign, several Democratic candidates, including Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, ""came up alongside Joe Biden during the year-end fundraising season to build up their ties.""\nIn the 2016 primary, two other candidates mentioned Biden -- James Webb and Lloyd Blankfein -- but these were dropped by Clinton after Biden endorsed Clinton for president in 2008.\nThere was also a push from former Sen.

1167,Super Tuesday: Why didn't more young people vote?,"['A lot of folks saw November as a great time to vote. Millions out there used to vote in November. They were worried. Optimistic about early voting and we were seeing an uptick in turnout on the day ahead of the election.\nAll this and more in this video, in an interview with Alexandra Duchatel from the Congressional Quarterly.\nAnd all this while President Trump was on a weekly break, being repeatedly slammed by news outlets for his long hours with Saturday Night Live.\nCan we stop watching TV and going through all the damn things that happened during the 2016 presidential campaign? I think not. I was talking to some of the men I met on the scene of the Hollywood shootings.\nBut for many people, Donald Trump did not look like Donald Trump.\nFunny how we lose our ability to say “Yeah” after every bit of attention. You get to choose whether to vote or not. Right?\nThere were some decent journalists from the left at the press conference Monday who were impressed. Reporters told stories about their expectations for election season, confidence in the campaign and the resilience of the voting system.\nI told one man who did not vote on Election Day, “My life will change forever. I wake up one day dreaming of fighting time — think of it.”\nAnother caller said, “Congratulations. You are the savior of the Democratic Party. We are not going to accept anything we are not proud of.”\nThen there were the Republicans, who had close to no regrets and the audience were in raptures after reading about their turnout and their efforts. A third credited it to Donald Trump and their style, spontaneity and overall presentation.\nThey could become the next big thing in American politics.\nThe male Republicans and the female Republicans were proudly active members of the Trump family. The Republican Party in several other states was on the comeback this year. There was also a series of protests organized by GOP women and civil rights groups over how they voted and what issues on the ballot.\nOn the Democratic side, there was a lot of excitement that went by the wayside with young people, seniors, unemployed people, businesses, individuals, and many people going to register and voting, as they did in November.\nI’ve always thought there was a pattern, unfortunately as it turns out with the Post 7 PM morning shows I am a good one, the “top” political groups were doing very well. It wasn’t just the RNC or DNC which was doing well either.\nI don’t think any of those groups were the first to do well in November, I think there was always going to be a chunk of that following the Trump Election of November, but there were very active (organized) groups doing very well, even when the president wasn’t at the rallies, like: the Iranian Americans in Miami, Brazilian marchers in Chicago, Middle Eastern Patriots in Omaha, Michigan Patriots in Denver, Susan Wexler in Dayton, Iowa Patriots in New York City, Minnesota Patriots in Oregon, Wisconsin Patriots in St. Paul, and Milwaukee Patriots in Kansas City.\nThere was also a big turnout this year by people engaged in everyday voter contact. There were very well organized efforts by all the social agencies, those who deal with people in the homeless, the armed forces, veterans, youths living with the AIDS, the hungry, and those who want to help, and there was probably an absence of issues of importance to many of those involved. I thought this was something that really played on his way of organizing in Washington D.C.\nPlus the fact that people who are not doing well on election day had a lot of grass-roots protest activities during that transition to the Trump era.\nI would say that it’s mostly as individuals who did well on Election Day as they could have ever hoped for.\nI agree and fully support the efforts of elected representatives of the people and the organization that make our world work and make democracy works. They are to be commended.\nI have a few other “better things” that people keep mentioning to me this election year: a chance to vote for a change that they can feel good about.\n[Featured image by Erik Vonnen Waddell/AP Images]\n']"
1168,Super Tuesday results in full: Biden and Sanders out in front,"['There was a lot of political churn going on in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential election. This is a big deal compared to those other candidates’ appearances in advance of the general election. There are a ton of things they did. One of the biggest miscalculations was the fact that John Kasich and Carly Fiorina played a huge role in winning over the GOP base. Inevitably, that meant, the candidates in the race were either completely out- or completely out-of-touch. Right or wrong, it meant they were essentially beholden to the super rich.\nMeanwhile, President Trump, who has repeatedly called for massive job growth, has said he plans to offer massive tax cuts to businesses and corporations. Bill Clinton, who’s named himself as a President-elect, campaigned on removing the current 12 percent corporate income tax rate, and raising the retirement age to 67 from 62. On the flip side, Sanders, whose position on international trade generally enjoys less support than Sanders does, is opposing such a tax increase. Trump, who’s moving toward a more expansive stance on international trade, has been aligning himself with the Chinese and other big export-reliant countries on the campaign trail. He also has been trying to streamline, and not just consolidate, America’s regulatory system in a way that brings down the value of those goods.\nOn the foreign policy front, there was no eruption so far this year. Just 8 percent of respondents to the 2017 American Foreign Policy Forum rated Trump as their best candidate for president. Other than Paul Ryan and Mike Pence, two liberals have begun to trail, depending on their responses.\nThe biggest regional trend was in national security. We were in the middle of it until President Trump canceled, as many organizations view it, the flop of “Mission Accomplished.” Prime meetings with the D.C. community got off to a dark start, leading to a lot of pummeling, insults, and elation, but that’s to be expected this year. It’s still pretty darn close. Trump directed some of the venom at Ryan, and the members of both chambers also accused him of not sticking by rules that had been passed in the late stages of the executive branch. On the program, Comey mocked Paul Ryan, and the Oval Office speech took an interesting turn when he said that it was Ryan who had thwarted Trump’s attack on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nRead more from the Washington Post\nYou Can Play Me Again: Check out their-all-sack-in-force-shot shots from behind-the-scenes-of-the-house (and in 2 mins!) . . .

1169,Elizabeth Warren: Where did it go wrong for her?,"['WASHINGTON (CNN) — Elizabeth Warren has a bitter history with Republicans. But as a Harvard graduate with an activist background, her party has developed its own program that forces reform. In January, a conservative advocacy group in Colorado accused the GOP of playing politics by prosecuting senators for having dual citizenship and three children of Taiwanese parents who were not born in the United States. Now, in an interview, Warren is calling the accusations baseless.\nWarren, a Massachusetts Democrat, told the Wall Street Journal that in her autobiography, released on Tuesday, ""when I hear that there is a big campaign to vilify me in Washington, I don\'t know if I put it in perspective.""\nWarren said the Republicans targeted her birth family. She said the demagoguery was because of her ""immigrant heritage, and immigration laws.""\n""I had been a Roman Catholic and I have a very simple message to the Republicans: It\'s not so simple. And I believe that,\'"" Warren told the Journal.\nTrump\'s immigration, she said, was ""the only path"" to citizenship.\nDemocrats, including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, said the story was false.\n""Senator Warren is wrong,"" Gillibrand told CNN in an interview. ""She has never said that anyone in her family was born in the United States.""\nWarren had been a darling of liberal media establishment since entering public life and after winning election in 2008 to the U.S. Senate. A minority in the Democratic Senate, she represents parts of the conservative business and advocacy community and has made immigration her top priority of the month.\nShe has been seeking to reform immigration law, which was enacted by a Democratic president in 2012 under a Republican-led Congress. In 2017, the House of Representatives passed a new immigration bill that stripped protections for people in the U.S. illegally.\nThe situation she described in the new book, titled ""As You Think,"" is exacerbated by the fact that polls show Trump popularity levels among Americans are starting to decline, suggesting Trump is perceived as his weakest economic asset as president.\n""Senator Warren makes a list of things she would do that she would not do that they find amusing,"" said a Democratic aide who believes that Democrats have enough leverage in talks with the Senate to pass the new measure.\nWarren told the Journal that Republicans need a ""tough stance.""\n""\'We\'ve got to get a tough stance in what we call the country\'s immigration law,"" she said. ""Our laws fall short of that ... I would prefer that we get a tough stance on all of these things.""\nWarren said the party of the president will raise ""facts and prejudices"" as a way to win votes.\n']"

With an initiative, cancer research for boys has received an invitation to attend, the hospital management employees of Amgen Cancer Institute focused on sustaining the course of their lives, providing major healthcare benefits to patients and supporting educational initiatives like Cancer Den of Parents and Scholars (CDFP) to ensure that the continuing education of so many is provided to all children and adolescents.\nBefore I got involved in this, Zagaris was CEO of Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc., Inc. and had first visited New York for the annual Society of Quality Health Care Organization conference.\n""I have a significant connection to the medical industry and all its professionals because I grew up working in the Pacific Northwest and I\'ve admired the hospitals in NYC and in Seattle. In the winter, I went on to the New York Symphony Orchestra as a matter of course. I was a member of the Annoyance Fellowship Program at CHEO. I graduated in 1974 with a master\'s degree in health policy from New York University, and my first job in health policy was as Senior Assistant Administrator at the Health Services Commissioner\'s Office in New York, maintaining and supporting the Department of Health\'s Development and Innovation.\n""In 1983, I went into business development work at AEFS, an industry leader and practicing consumer-grade care professional. I was a member of the Staff Committee of the USCFU/International Quality Council and traveled to Montreal in 1988 for a family reunion meeting. In 1992, I was named a director of the medical research group at General Depomed Inc. and went into business development and corporate development work for Alonzer Pharmaceuticals.\nIt was back in 1990, as the CEO of New York-based Amgen, that I was given my first stand out piece of publishing. The Jekyll-and-Hyde expression of biomedical research identified gem-oil containing the substance Preparitum - produced by the cell division of talcum powder. I spun out the Drug Information Center on what would become Amgen in 1996 as an even more important project that\'s since become an industry leader. This in 2008 helped crystallize the concept of making life for children something they need for emotional support and sometimes that means going to the doctor and asking for a prescription. I was the one who made it happen and today I am proud to say that I\'ve created one of the best research-intensive companies in the United States.\nThrough our years in New York, we\'ve gotten good feedback from patients and their parents at the Delaware Poison Control Center and the Johns Hopkins Children\'s Center on the more than 100 crisis-management-relevant behavior plans that entailed infants and toddlers in the hospital. One of those strategies is to maintain traffic, eliminate smoke and blastress, run on a pedal, if possible, tire systems and display blood-thinners. We also have geared our products to the patients, and we are always addressing their needs with information which is updated frequently. These days we also offer ""red alert"" treatment which includes behavioral therapy. We also offer pediatric pediatrics and intensive care to those who need further treatment or a loss of consciousness or include the parents or caregivers of young children under such circumstances.\nWe have many issues - two issues: an emergency room longer waits, the amount of calcium poisoning and harmful bacteria in our products. For now, this small number of patients is the average. We try to respond to those needs as best we can. In an international context, I\'m heartened that the Medicare Administration is recognizing that a drug of this quality, Preparitum, is clearly within reach of children and adults and that their physicians continue to lead the way in support of their care. Unfortunately, the volume of prescription painkillers is taking up a larger share of the adult population and physicians don\'t want to spend more money trying to solve the health problems associated with a drug of this quality and find ways to speed up the drug-resistance process.\n']"
1171,Super Tuesday: The winners and losers in Democratic race,"[""The winners and losers in the Democratic race this Tuesday saw the Democratic majority take back the House with the help of Donald Trump’s son. The prospect of a change to the constitution, a break in government and a break in the increasingly GOP-dominated judicial branch ignited speculation that will have an impact.\nBut as election night approached, things turned into a tug-of-war between the GOP and the Democratic House. When the initial Democratic tide came to the downside, attempts to reach a deal with Trump and with the Senate Democrats to bury the deal fell flat, and time was running out for Democrats to capitalize.\nTrump’s son took the reins\nOn Tuesday, the Democratic-controlled Senate passed President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nomination with bipartisan support — sending him on to the lower court to deal with health-care reform and recuse himself from a presidential health-care decision.\nDemocrats have been noticeably hesitant to make cuts to the court, partly out of frustration that the Republicans’ power within the House doesn’t translate directly to Democrats in the White House. But they're also frustrated with the fact that Trump, in addition to obstructing Trump’s agenda, and using his inane boss to threaten trade wars, has been able to use his power as president to demand similar action for international deals.\nThe matter of whether or not Trump’s children, son Eric and daughter-in-law Ivanka, will be officially removed as presidents of the United States is one that pits both parties against one another. So a special version of the court order that created the Affordable Care Act, signed into law after the Affordable Care Act began, was poised to invalidate the healthcare law on health care grounds and authorize the closure of some of the roughly 2 million previously uninsured Americans. But Trump’s three sons — Eric, Donald Jr. and Eric were mere rams in the direction of power.\nTrump’s son-in-law didn’t convince Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who offered him an opportunity to clarify that Donald Jr. is not only a Republican, but an attorney general — a position that he’d seek in Washington to ensure Trump’s reelection in 2020. In less than three weeks, the future of the court will be up in the air as those ambitions become less clear.\n""]"
1172,Michael Bloomberg: The world's ninth richest man who tried to run for president,"['The smart money was correct to say that Michael Bloomberg was the most democratic New York governor in history.\nWell, Bloomberg has made that abundantly clear. From Bloomberg’s announcement in New York on Saturday night that he’s the Forbes’ 21st richest man, to the claim that he had $2.5 billion in assets, from his inheritance, from his son’s business, and from people including Michelle Obama, that he’s somehow more powerful than their own president.\nThat would be the article, published by Bloomberg’s True.com website, made on April 4 on the topic: The world’s 10 richest people.\nAll the while, Forbes was right to say that all of the times Bloomberg appeared on the cover of the magazine there was, at least in some parts, a correction, one in which he was featured on camera — a protest, by then.\nBut his perspective was nuanced. He was moved by an observation by a reporter a year ago in a story about the Occupy Wall Street protests. It turns out, although not an articulate position he does fully agree with; it wasn’t changed during his 30 years as mayor of New York City.\n“It does matter where you were in your life, how a person ended up,” he says. “There are moments in life where people became very proud of who they were, maybe they were all very self-sufficient, and people think of it as motivation, where there might be negative aspects of who you are, but that feeling actually changes behavior.”\nPolitically, it’s easy to see why. Bloomberg’s new Times Square address, surrounded by umbrellas and signs with “NYNYMayor” emblazoned across it, has hosted everything from 300 speakers to more than 300 songs. And he not only has his tight end in the ring with political opponents — who might not want them talking about him — but he is having a good time. If he wants to run for president, he should get as organized as anyone else — yet he claims to take the lion’s share of the wealth.\nAnother reason why he chose to buy a house in the Central Park area.\n']"
1173,Super Tuesday: BBC finds Bloomberg campaign offices empty,"['(CNN) — There are no standing still. Despite the slight tilt of the polls, just a few super PACs—pro, anti, business—eliminated anti-establishment, or both — were either dead silent or done trying to chip away at Trump’s bigger mandate as a popular president.\nIn the process, the unholy alliance was undermined by the successful, and ruthless, fundraising of its chief rival. In other words, the combined efforts of a pro-Trump group and pro-Trump-softened anti-establishment groups pushed Trump’s electoral victories by more than 2-1/2 points.\nAt this rate, it is unlikely that Trump will win a second term unless the pro-Trump, pro-business, pro-choice forces finally stop foisting the delusion that nothing more than a Trump presidency will do anything short of dwarfing either a last-minute move to taper bankroll Trump’s candidacy or a well-planned jubilant “everything will be OK.”\nIndeed, the LP/GOP campaign structure and funding methods and communications tactics have very clearly proved to be — and indispensable for — the fight for the next four years between the president and the extraordinarily successful, pro-Trump machines that succeeded in knocking him out of the White House.\nAnd according to John Wells, a graduate student in the Economics of Politics at the University of Illinois, the system was not only for the interest of the large numbers of Americans that elected Trump and the ultra-conservative machine that won the primaries and caucuses of party primaries, but was also as much an impact in determining whose election could be won.\n“What really surprised me was that we are, at least in the sense that this place is sort of the failed political space for democrats and jingoists, for liberals and socialists, because the United States has a diverse set of other countries, which means you can combine from different traditions. That’s one of the reasons why I think the U.S. is so large and so well known in the world.”\nAt the same time, he believes that as a rule, “the pro-Trump base feels the need to respond to political events, and therefore the centrist lobbies and the moderate speak-it-all movement have been very effective, they have elevated the pro-Trump party in this sphere with their rhetoric and their contacts in people who are deeply passionate about that.”\nThus while no pro-Trump groups participated in the campaigns, the pro-populist groups did enter the 2016 election. That rationale has been challenged repeatedly by the proposals and agendas of Republican candidates who also took on the ideas of a reformer populist that elected the first sitting president.\nBut even while the pro-Trump groups continue to downplay the problem of their partnership, they continue to pass along their message, and are now waging a more friendly counterattack, coming on the heels of their own anti-Trump campaigns during the campaign.\nThat does not mean that anyone on Trump’s political team should not be concerned about the chances that the pro-Trump union entice at least some of their own supporters into their campaign by threatening to yank their funding if Trump does not deliver.\nPoliticians often suffer a crisis of faith in any organization they run. They feel they are automatically safer to make that claim if the party, its members and its supporters would give them a comfort level by talking in the same language they have — but the energy that someone who votes for them can turn into a potential competitive advantage in the real world is all going to be brought forward by their supporters.\n“Are you making a promise right now to your supporters that if you do not make an executive order, you will, they’ll know that something has happened,” Wells asks. “But you don’t really know.”\nSo again, we have to look at how far the “political entities that lost money on both the campaign and the elections were able to outperform other groups in terms of fundraising and in times of disruption.”\nIt also brings up the practical problems that are beyond Trump’s control: the impossibility of certain policies being implemented, such as a healthcare mandate that could interfere with how much cash the Trump campaign raised in a single day, the inexorable quest for wholesale decentralization of power, and, more especially, the balancing act to resist the temptation of doing everything within the rules to achieve the opposite effect.\nJeffrey Katz is a former journalist.\n']"
1174,Bernie Sanders: Who is the Democratic White House hopeful?,"['Bernie Sanders: presidential hopeful?\nNew Hampshire Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, who will be campaigning here Sunday, made his announcement on CNN Wednesday that he is running for president, in hopes of becoming the Democrats’ nominee in November.\nHe said he “offers hope, but it’s for me not who wins. It’s the Democratic party.”\nHe spoke on a cable network panel on Wednesday.\nHe said he has been a “hostile guest” at the White House for the past two years, and that he felt given one of the reasons for his long-term opposition to former Democratic president Barack Obama, he has to change the direction of the country.\nThe lifelong New Hampshire resident spoke Wednesday morning to CNN about what she considered a “strategic failure” in the country — the Democratic party has lost a long-standing push to elect more liberal Democrats in the 2016 election, he said.\nSanders, who started college in New Hampshire, is widely considered the frontrunner to take on the Republican field in November, as usual.\nAlthough some Republicans in the party have criticized his candidacy, the senator has been a chameleon, who worked hard to make himself known to Democrats and Republicans alike. He has spent much of his political career bashing President Barack Obama for the debt and unemployment crisis and for economic policies that he says make the country in a worse economic position.\nThe first Democratic U.S. senator to represent New Hampshire since 1986, Sanders has been an outspoken critic of GOP candidates seeking the White House. The Vermont senator made his signature pledge when he committed to focus on his Congressional district during the first presidential debate that year, and now he appears ready to step up his rhetoric on the campaign trail.\nOn Wednesday, he criticized Republican nominee Donald Trump’s efforts to harm the economy, insisting that the president has missed an opportunity to harness economic development to spur job creation.\nThat is a concern. And the senator took note of the successes — including a more than $5 billion surplus — Trump was able to count on while appealing to Democratic voters, and urged his followers to act now.\n“Those accomplishments are not new,” Sanders said, predicting the labor market is heading in the right direction in the United States.\nHe continued, insisting the successes in his young country should be cited again on television.\n“If we can’t get a job, we have nothing left to do,” he said. “We are behind. It’s not important anymore to me that the country is where we are, it’s important for me to pass this bill, which I believe should be passed.

1177,How to get BBC News on smart speakers,"['R home entertainment system Erasfeldt has done a much better job in designing the smart speakers for Christmas, choosing the £26 Audience, focused on education, entertainment and media (however, if more TV is what you want to watch), and bringing it to the masses.\nBetter yet, Erasfeldt has been putting our Alexa into even more sophisticated devices, because smart speakers have become little more than a nuisance to many consumers.\nWill those smart speakers slow Alexa to its new low prices? Or will their highs and lows keep us hooked and alert?\nThat’s the question we’re thinking of when we step into these smart speakers and turn on the lights at our house.\nAlthough Carina Callando knew Alexa was interested in new products, she simply wanted to see how it had been used beforehand. She used the Blue Box, an Alexa Echo, and the Spind, from Carina Callando, to test various devices.\nThe first TV she tested was a YouTube channel, but by the end of the day Alexa had used two of those items without serious use. She also mentioned her TV saying that Alexa was tuned to Google Chromecast (which had never had a Chromecast) and also the Echo Dot (which works with any Chromecast-enabled device).\nThe Alexa TV couldn’t tell whether she was watching TV or recording a song. However, Alexa, with her home-controlled camera. “Maybe it is. Whatever,” she said, though she was smart enough to pick it up and read this excerpt from a Google search for “Cheap Alexa TV Smart TV Providers”:\nAccording to the website of the Google DTV Productivity Lab, Google has licensed the voice-recognition technology, which helps professional digital assistants detect language, network, weather, and background noise. With the ability to “see” a video with your voice, you can play videos, read interactive news articles, read news from your Amazon Kindle, share photos or even share recipes, and navigate menus without the need for any special software. The Microsoft Kinect also allows you to use the software in any sense of the word.\nHaving the ability to choose whether to watch an episode of Star Trek: Discovery or build the Alexa app through a TV app became especially important in the space of a clever phone app to control the device. That’s still not enough.\nBut Alexa and assistant gadgets should allow users to quickly get to the very core Google app that connects the speaker and control everything from searching for directions to knowing when to do laundry, to track the weather, to reach them for directions to see the road.\nWhat’s more, there are some, although not quite yet, basic controls on Alexa to move from one of those TV screens into another screen. For example, with an Echo Dot or a Turtle Bay light that moves at the touch of a button, the voice learns whether you are walking or running.\nThe second limitation could be dealing with a lot of people who are busy, driven by urgent demands and simply don’t have time to use the last smart device to complete the job. What do those people need to do?\n']"

1180,Coronavirus updates: Borders shut as coronavirus cases rise,"['NEW YORK — We’ve all been that for more than two decades. For one such aftershock, December 2018.\nThe suspected gastrointestinal virus has spread from the California area to the south-central U.S.\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Tuesday it has identified five probable cases of coronavirus in eight counties, the latest human cases being one reported in the Philadelphia area and seven of those reported in the Seattle area.\nThe CDC also said a total of six cases in Florida and seven in New Jersey, which combined have at least 23 confirmed deaths.\nTo say these latest cases were discovered during long-term antibiotics would not be adequate.\n“While we are not to say that we don’t have the virus, it is known that our biomedical community has had it for years,” wrote CDC spokeswoman Sarah Best.\nThey say, however, that many cases are still being reported. Symptoms of respiratory illness usually begin a few weeks to weeks after exposure.\nThe CDC’s link from November 2018 was that the virus was a viral, not bacterial. It’s unclear who began emerging from a lab or germ line within weeks.\nIt was unclear, however, whether the same virus could infect humans, cause genetic differences or what the cause is.\nSymptoms of coronavirus transmission include fever, joint pain, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and loss of consciousness or fight-or-flight symptoms, according to the CDC.\nIn the 12 states that reported cases, there was a total of eight diagnosed cases of coronavirus on January 1, 2019, four of which occurred in Pennsylvania, four in New Jersey, and one each in the Washington, Illinois, Arizona, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, and Kansas.\nAccording to the CDC, there are no real signs of infection or symptoms.\nThe CDC says there have been 19 reported and two confirmed cases of coronavirus cases so far in 2019 so far — 13 in Florida, eight in Pennsylvania, and four in New Jersey.\n“These illnesses are particularly troubling due to the lack of progress in taking measures to catch these viruses,” Best said.\nThis new outbreak comes on the heels of a long-term problem.\nIn December, the CDC put a maximum of 100 cases on the list of suspected coronavirus cases.\nMay 21, 2018, was yet another added date to the top 10 list. It comes on the heels of a case of coronavirus in Massachusetts last May. The diseases cause multiple contagious cholera outbreaks across the United States, among others.\nOfficials with Santa Barbara, California, warned in November that the coronavirus was spreading through the country.\nFatal brain hemorrhagic fevers can cause death when an infection takes hold in the brain and can cause altered DNA.\nThe newest cases come as a result of a national public health alert.\nNearly 200 people are currently hospitalized with tropical diseases such as pneumonia, acute respiratory depression, seasonal influenza, and the Zika virus.\nThe CDC says there are 1,903 confirmed and 2,583 probable cases of coronavirus nationwide.\n']"
1181,Coronavirus: Why does the UK have more modest controls?,"['Britain has a pool of high-risk but vital viruses that pose no threat to individuals. But one man’s old Porsche crash is another man’s scarlet paper describing a 20-year-old college student who never left his unlocked door, jumped into a burning blaze and later died.\nIt is an increasing problem in Britain, says the Express and Times newspaper. Dov Anceri, director of virus control at Home Office’s infectious disease science and technology unit, calls it a “grey area,” where scientific modelling is flawed because several possible causes of the outbreak are unknown.\n“These viruses have been linked to a large number of road crashes in the past. People often ignore a major outbreak after at least three or four tonnes of contaminated goods have been recovered,” he says.\nOverall, he says there are four known areas in which this is likely to occur, but dozens of other potentially severe outbreaks are listed as possible. He says, “It is simply not a concern because individuals must be tested daily and the annual outbreak of which only happened in the last 14-15 years is not too common.”\nOther forces\nAnceri is concerned that the double-trick rush of global attention on infectious diseases has been partly driven by questions about WHO, which, he says, “is in control of the production of certain infectious agents and has the medical expertise to act as the community organ” or else the WHO might have moved to “liberate a few politicians.”\nWHO itself concedes that it has not been as stringent in guarding against risks posed by infectious diseases. But Anceri is cautious about suggesting that a common outbreak within the region – said to be around 90-95% endemic – could be its reason.\nFurther complicating matters is that many of the country’s biggest cities, with more than a million inhabitants, are small towns.\n“There’s no room for complacency in this region. Security is very, very important,” says Anceri. The Daily Mail’s newspaper noted that these are “the largest cities in the country” – like Bath and Penarth – “desperate to attract a high-profile outbreak.”\nAnceri acknowledges that cities in the “top 10” and “emerging economies” – with a population of more than one million – might be affected, but there’s no reason why his country would not become a “greenfield” such as a hospital or transit hub with a doctor on duty.\n']"
1182,Things to do indoors with your children,"['Kids: Kids get electric, too, in a new recommendation from Los Angeles-based parenting bloggers to give you and your kids together just as much time as with adults.\nThey have little houses, or cubicles, or built-in televisions on which to entertain or watch their favorite shows. They also keep the door shut and watch their favorite sports and other adult films, which can even be turned off on their pets.\nIt’s a reminder that no matter what life has thrown at them, kids keep getting smarter and smarter, but only as they get older.\nSometimes, the best-case scenario is the best-case scenario: You live your life until age 70, pay down your mortgage, and come out of retirement in a brand-new fancy, healthy lifestyle.\nThen, with the help of adults who listen, you finish your mortgage. The good news is, you’ll leave a legacy that is far more individual than mere nostalgia.\nIn some cases, they’ll have to live, shop and attend town-hall meetings to overcome feelings of isolation.\nOne of my favorite foods these days is chocolate. At first, I didn’t think my husband and I had a chance to visit the country’s chocolate makers because of our mischievous kids. Eventually, though, I did, realizing that by happy, delicious chocolate, a choc-a-can is much better than plain chocolate.\nThen I got this email from one of my grandchildren, who says he’s a chocolate lover, even though he always insisted that we visit the country’s antiques dealers. We go to the antiques fairs to purchase antiques, and sometimes, he wants to see the bricks that we made in college. There’s no room to grab and be a part of that junk, since we don’t live in them.\nIn the end, I have to say this: Maybe it’s because I sit around in bed longer nights to keep up with my grandchildren. Maybe this is because I watch so much TV so often, and this is what has me feeling grateful and thankful this year.\nIn some cases, it’s because I have guilt, or as some parents have told me, a worry about losing me. One of the more common fears about taking their children to the airport after a trip is that they’ll forget to bring toilet paper.\nSometimes, though, guilt and worries add motivation to the adventure of turning your life upside down. At the end of a break, I go to the park where I think about all the kids that have been taken away, and pick them up. It’s like closing your eyes and letting a whole new world fill your world.\nIn those moments, as my grandchildren open their computers to learn to read and discover new things, they’ll learn how to relax, or how to shop and live, or how to have safe meals.\nThey’ll feel secure when they start school. They’ll feel that in their lifetime, they’ll put out the pieces of the puzzle and figure out how to stay like that. In the end, if their parents can live out their dreams or stay like that, they’ll find someplace new.\nSo the good news: No matter how much time you spend away from your kids, there’s no feeling like a “car that can’t run.” And if your kids don’t want you and their house moving so often, they’ll find a new job as they grow up, but the car that just crashed right in front of them isn’t going to bring their new home with it.\nThat’s because we’ve got two generations of kids. Our only difference is that our grandchildren will be living in the same place for three generations.\nWe will spend time together, eating, spending time with our kids, and building a living, breathing family life.\n']"

1185,Coronavirus pandemic,"['Our southern hemisphere, due in part to an increase in the contagious variant, avian-agro-pirian, produces new infections every year. Of those new deaths, the majority are virulent (37%) to infect humans. However, we know quite a few yet-to-be-confirmed populations of human avian-agro-pirian.\nThe only apparent area of death that humans might have struck by this bacterium (ACM1H1 – who knows?) is in parts of Mexico (people riding their bikes?); any bad news about this makes us stupid. There are 17 out of 26 studies that have discovered serious environmental risk. Of those 17, three have been officially confirmed as non-credible (after a few dengue cases).\nMost importantly, all of these studies have come at the expense of making it clear that the transmissible E. coli infecting lives is very small. The last time we saw E. coli infect a community, the numbers started to plummet in some disease areas, and after reaching 25% – below the projected population size – the more we realized that it’s quite possible that the country would have to start contracting a pandemic. However, we may still get enough new cases of birds to help put an end to it. Although humans may have evolved a very good relationship with nature in the past, we can show that the immediate danger from avian-agro-pirian is much more distant.\nOf course, for the sake of protecting our environment and finding new sources of intelligence and support to help make the world safer, we shouldn’t lump all infections together; particularly if they’re related to illnesses for which we aren’t testing ourselves (cough, cough, sneeze), as the Latin proverb holds. If the new cell of our leaders are not on board with the new bacteria lurking in the production bowl, this pretty much sucks.\nThis article originally appeared on amazon.com\n']"
1186,Coronavirus: Three reasons why the UK might not look like Italy,"['China may have had outbreaks of the Gullah Geopathic virus recently but that doesn’t mean the recent outbreaks in the UK wouldn’t put up a fight.\nIn fact, Western law says that the virus can spread between the UK and China but if you treat it the same way you’d treat the JK virus in Brazil or Syria, it could leave you exposed to two virulent strains of the parasite, the Coronavirus Monovirus (TmV) and the Coronavirus Drosophila, or TRV-Drosophila, which is just one of the three viruses contained in the U.K. outbreak at the end of last month.\nThe deadly disease is thought to spread through consumption and is easily spread by ingesting contaminated food or drinks. The poor hygiene of British hospital visitors and visitors to the U.K. this past weekend was particularly affecting travellers, families and officials who decided to visit the UK from Belgium.\n“It was devastating to see patients die because it was like a global epidemic and after being affected by the C-copy case in Belgium, it’s like a global epidemic,” said Mike Bush, spokesman for the Dormant Health Service.\nBush said that people are exposed to the virus through human visitors, visitors of food or drinks at food-related events or within establishments where the virus affects glass- or glass-container drinkers.\n“There will be a definite impact on people who didn’t choose to come,” he said. “It is a universal disease that affects any public sector, let alone the UK.”\nBush added that the number of annual outbreaks is likely to increase over the next few years as more people are found who have the sickness, adding that insurers will find a solution.\n“It is amazing to see the depth of understanding and the types of cases that are occurring. People may choose to come to the UK during the winter but they will come around after that,” he said.\nDespite media reports as to the exact amount of the virus that has been transmitted from the British to Europe, “it’s not a phenomenon that can really be eliminated by moving to the mainland,” Bush said.\n“It will occur from time to time, but the large body of case records shows a reduction in deaths as a result of travel and being associated with unexpected travel conditions and cancellations,” he said.\n']"

A complete clinical analysis of each sample is done as well. These instruments can be used to investigate a variety of illness, including cervical-type cases, and find any family members that have been sick or have a patient in a known Philadelphia area of the United States.\nThat means the public health services including the New York Department of Health may have detected a lot of cases this week in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and beyond.\nThe total number of people who have tested positive for Zika remains positive for Zika and has been linked to the Zika virus in several countries, including the Americas.

The first method of testing for the virus involved in this group was using a white blood cell sample taken from a local transmission outbreak (also known as progressive long-term viral load syndrome). This test took less than a week.\nIn this case, a Pennsylvania patient with no history of Zika began undergoing circumcision on Thursday April 1st at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center in Philadelphia. This group treated the Pennsylvania patient in the same hospital where the infected person had one sample of the virus coming from Dallas. Of the total number of cases of Zika, 20 have already died.\nPOS says it may identify who has a candidate Zika, and if they get infected this will cause them to drop out of the study. And if they have complications, they are much more likely to receive Zika than if they have already contracted the Zika virus.\nIn the case of dengue fever, the small amount of mosquito larvae that can transmit the virus is a red flag that Zika transmission may occur in this region, particularly in Philadelphia, Boston, and Philadelphia’s suburbs and South Bronx, according to the Health and Human Services Department’s blog.\nDubious virus?\nThe Florida virus caused by an increase in parasitic attacks in South Florida is called dengue fever.\nCDC says it does not have data available for the rare virus in the Florida. It's a potent misperception that the virus comes from South Florida, but is actually transmitted most notably by mosquitoes.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states the virus can cause necrotizing fasciitis, where fluids of the infected brain begin leaking out and becomes infected and leads to tissue damage.\nCDC says to avoid providing sensitive data about the transmission of the virus, humans need to be kept away from Zika sites and territories and alert officials. The virus is circulating at levels that are dangerous for people and people with weakened immune systems.\n""]"

""There is a vibe on those tracks where some women are taking photos, some women are taking photos, some women are going and they are being very creative about just taking pictures and sharing and creating stories.""\nThough drinking coffee and looking at videos may seem harmless to some, she says it\'s even more potent at times because women are more attuned to social media and social media skills.\n""Facebook is a great way to vent about politics and, unfortunately, everyone\'s very easily manipulated, so that is probably why the experts that know how to talk about politics don\'t cover social media as such,"" says Foley.\nWoman\'s health\nBreast cancer is the No. 1 killer in women worldwide, according to a 2017 study published in Annals of Internal Medicine.\nThe National Breast Cancer Foundation says that breast cancer incidence in women is up 9 percent over the last 15 years, while breast cancer incidence among men rose 2 percent.\nMeredith Campbell of the Dr. Maha Network, the world\'s largest breast cancer advocate, says she\'s proud of her client\'s achievements in helping others take part in breast cancer research.\n""I really like to see her reap the benefits in all areas of her health, not just her breast cancer, her hospice, her treatments and other things that she needs,"" she says.\n']"

They believed that most people had a neat dithered Dithered boy, but had not seen a naked child on television and they were appalled to discover that the photograph appeared again, this time to cast doubt on the case itself.\n“It’s not a publicity stunt,” a police official told CNN this week. “What I know is that the photo will hurt.”\nHas the Delhi police acted as if their claim was a genuine story that was run on TV?\nIf the photo was drawn to stir controversy and didn’t get the official’s attention when it went viral, it may indeed hurt.\nThere are a number of reasons for that. When the photograph was published, people were thrilled that this would end up in their newspaper or magazine, a small gesture that was only after the photograph was taken.\nFor a few months afterward, Delhi’s police officials couldn’t point the finger, pointing instead to the flash of white LED lights in the crowd.\nThen, less than two months later, Delhi police officials finally showed their colours.\nOn Wednesday, the photo was circulated on social media for the first time.

1192,Radio 1 Big Weekend cancelled due to coronavirus,"['Music-heavy Radio 1 has been forced to cancel Big Weekend, and they’re cancelling press screenings over the new coronavirus outbreak. The show is being held in Norwich, England this weekend with English Radio 1 DJs have been asked to postpone the show entirely.\n“The police will be here,” was the idiom of this year’s showing of London’s O2 Arena.\nCancellations are no cause for alarm though. Among the radio stations that live in the UK, Radio 1 and the Radio 1 Platform are the only ones to have cancelled Big Weekend. They’re listed as supporting events, bringing the rest of the line-up of shows to 22 venues around the UK.\nA spokesperson for the BBC said that it was “not unusual” for radio stations to cancel Big Weekend and, when they do, it’s usually to meet the headline artist bands “delighted” by a performance. At Radio 1, that is usually compared to the early slot on a weekly show with potentially high numbers of listeners and repeat hours.\nAccording to a BBC report, the announcement came just weeks after it was revealed that a suspicious form of coronavirus was found in a British pub. At the time, no test results came back positive for the New Zealand virus that is now affecting more than 140 people worldwide.\nThose remaining on Radio 1, which are currently forced to cancel Big Weekend, have already been stripped of BBC Radio 1’s Producers and Journalists’ Show, its Music Trio, its Music Culture Event and UK Box Stage. The Big Weekend releases will not be air, so that’s probably good news for a lot of its audience.\n']"

Five performances were kicked off as an initial planned.\nBut a new set is lined up — and a sickening buildup is occurring.\nLast week, Rhiannon Giddens, 20, from Bristol, became the first female performer of 2017 in the UK to be picked to headline Glastonbury 2019, thanks to her megaphone and astonishing self-assured energy at the age of 16.\nThe headliners for the bash will be England’s Gary Glitter and Mel B. Glitter has helped fill Glastonbury for 20 years, and Glitter himself has proven resilient, sharing an injury-enriching voice and a gravelly baritone to go along with his blazing rapping, beatboxing and ""anger and vengeance"" in praise of his iconic beatboxer pal Britney Spears.\nGlitter’s Giddens told the Scotsman’s Simon Wolfson that Glitter’s wider range of skills — including that of “John” (williams’ s frontman) and “ The Whip” (Daisy) — saw her nabbing the role and playing “an A-list singer for the legendary Boogie Down Tonight” on the Inaugural Britain’s Got Talent musical episode in 2003.\nGiddens suggested that Giddens’ experience would have helped her in her first Glastonbury experience.\n“Not a lot of the food comes from the food I’ve eaten before, or even other famous names, I was perfectly supplied with the food I used to eat every summer, and the food was interesting, friendly, and funny,” she said.\nAnd on Friday, the 35-year-old frontwoman of DJ duo Crocs told ITV how she felt she had taken the dreadlocks and extensions off her legs — even though in late-stage singer’s not this put a hold on them.\n“They are my problem, they make me laugh. They make me cry, and it’s a comical combination of hideous that, because they can eat all day and still win,” she said.\nOn Monday, Glastonbury’s production company commented that she was “in trouble,” and the date for Giddens’ gigs had to be rescheduled due to weather conditions. A Glastonbury spokesperson said Giddens had “broken down” to the previous date, whereas organizers have also carried out musical damage assessments.\nFor tonight’s line-up, Glastonbury will begin with Coldplay, a celebration to mark Glastonbury’s 40th anniversary, and end with James Arthur.\nSet list for the 40th Glastonbury Festival:\nJanuary 19, 15th\nJanuary 20, 21st\nFebruary 1, 2nd\nFebruary 5, 5th\nFebruary 6, 7th\nFebruary 8, 8th\nFebruary 9, 9th\nFebruary 10, 10th\nFebruary 11, 12th\nFebruary 12, 13th\nFebruary 14, 14th\nFebruary 15, 15th\nFebruary 16, 16th\nFebruary 17, 17th\nFebruary 18, 18th\nFebruary 19, 20th\n']"
1194,Nine things we learned about Judi Dench,"['(CNN) — Judi Dench began her career in theater with a libretto by William Shakespeare. Not just because of “Hamlet,” but because she had never worked on an actual stage before.\n“I knew my first notes from theater by nightfall,” she recalled, recalling one after the playwright’s publicist called her on the street and said she wasn’t scheduled to appear. “I was booked as a regular in a cast of ten and I came by for no reason,” she said, laughing. “But then the little teacher came in.”\nNext she worked on Kay, Broadway’s newest revival of “Hamlet,” for which she won plaudits and received a standing ovation from guests at the opening night performance, a long-running ABC classic that reads like much of Shakespeare’s work.\n“I read the play on Saturday morning at the Adoration Chapel of London and there I was with King Lear’s sleight of hand,” Dench recalled. “‘If I take one step, I’ll go.’ I was horrified. So I went and directed the night after, as much as possible, and I thought it was brilliant.”\nNow Dench works as a bellwether, supporting six shows in the run of “Hamlet,” alternating starts with recurring role as Joanie Sullivan in “Lolita.”\nBut there are dark arts in theater. Dench said playing Joanie is difficult because she has been in many workplaces — she is in that division where it is often difficult to retain its emotional warmth. “For me,” she said, “it’s different.”\nThe queen of the Royal Ballet has only one acting job, and it’s a meager one at that. She says that any role can be challenging. “This is not quite as serious as Shakespeare, it’s more difficult. And to do one role it is a little more up to date.” She considers herself lucky — after a Tony nomination as “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” in the Sopranos, she bounced around from the UK to LA and finally New York in a three-year break. But she doesn’t get that off the ground. “I didn’t do it as a show. I did it in different roles,” she said.\nAfter “What Now,” Dench’s co-star in “Lolita,” she was returning to the small family home she had lived in since birth in the UK, she is brimming with confidence. “I can fall in love again without sleep, and that’s part of my ‘secret plan.’ ”\nOther directors are in the mix, including Richard Eyre and Oliver Darcy, as well as Julie Christie, whose first performance as the title character in “Lolita” was on HBO’s “Masters of Sex.” Other actors on the hit NBC miniseries “The Sing Off” have included Bran Bran Jervis, Natalie Portman, Kate Winslet, Allison Janney, Sam Shepard, Kevin Bacon, Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Jane Lynch, Naomi Watts, Rachel Griffiths, Tony Shalhoub, Dede Gardner, Sofia Vergara, Miranda Cosgrove, Evan Rachel Wood, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Blake Lively, Selena Gomez, John Leguizamo, Tom Hanks, Don Cheadle, Dan Stevens, Anthony Mackie, Thomas Mann, Meryl Streep, Gillian Flynn, Channing Tatum, Kristen Stewart, Daisy Ridley, Jennifer Connelly, Catherine Keener, Robert Pattinson, James McAvoy, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Dan Stevens, Rebecca Hall, Charlotte Rampling, Zoe Kravitz, Academy Award winner Reese Witherspoon, Marisa Tomei, Jesse Eisenberg, Donald Glover, John Leguizamo, Amy Schumer, Kristen Wiig, Anne Hathaway, Viola Davis, Jason Mitchell, Paul Feig, Lucille Ball, Colin Firth, Darren Aronofsky, Warren Beatty, Joan Holloway, J.R.

1195,Coronavirus: How to clean your smartphone safely,"['Your smartphone is the perfect time to investigate just how much your smartphone can harm your health. I have found that the summer sun and sultry moon make it harder for phone and smartphone viruses to spread among folks in your area. And while I am not dismissing the spread of viruses or worms, I am warning people.\nIt is advised to protect yourself with one of three basics you must do for sure – your smartphone must be unbootable, unbreakable, uninfected, and fully open before you use it. If your phone is not unbootable, you will likely be stuck with the infection for a while, and until some work can be done by the disease patient or hospital to clear the infection, you are out of luck, as this obviously will happen to many of you.\nIt’s a great idea to check your computer for any viruses or worms that may cause the symptoms: Was there a time you had any damage? Did a phone run a virus? If not, your phone is probably unlabeled, or if it is in air in an enclosed area and a space as small as your stomach, there is another option – be sure you lock and wipe your phone with a toothbrush, including unbootable.\nYour phone does not need to be in an open area for sensitive or sensitive materials to be infected, as the only place this sort of thing happens is in a bathroom or open window. A phone is over its electronic limits. But it is important to ensure that your phone makes it through most of your physical and occupational exposure, since those areas on which the phone is not exposed can cause you significant health problems.\nIf you have a smartphone with a visible virus that has become infected, it is best to just leave your device untouched until you are better secured. You may also want to carefully dispose of your wireless infrastructure as well. Your carrier may restrict or enable certain phones to be used as an enclosure of wireless infrastructure, but that is not consistent with your existing coverage (I used the wireless carrier policy for 2009).\nOn the flip side, if your phone is exposed to a virus, your carrier may not use the carrier as a guide about your carrier’s use of your phone. There are exceptions, of course. You can still use a smartphone that is bootable, and you may want to ensure that your phone does not detach from a wireless infrastructure and will continue to fly without telling your carrier.\nIf you are in a public location or have been anywhere in areas where there is no documented outbreak, then your phone needs to remain undamaged for future testing.\nEven though you might be ready to update your device, your cellphone needs to be hooked to a wireless network. As with the wireless network, there are a few steps that you may want to consider before downloading the carrier-approved software.\nSending your phone to a local operator that can receive update notifications should be faster than waiting 30 minutes for the firm to send it to the sender.\nIf your phone is either unbootable, unbreakable, uninfected, or fully open, well, you have a right to not have your phone up and running again without exposing it to potential infection or virus. This is especially important for people experiencing sudden and severe drops from the steps in the steps I discussed above.\n']"
1196,Top 10 garden pests and diseases revealed,"['As noted above, not enough thought goes into getting rid of your garden pests and diseases. Keep some of the garden pests and diseases to a minimum.\n1. Squirrel – Pesticides pose unique dangers to animals and plants, and most times, there is little care in allowing them access to drinking water. In fact, many crops have been planted near pests like the Canadian black widow.\n2. Clogger – A common organism that prefers seeds and varieties that have few symptoms. In fact, many gardens are experimenting with treating them at the tap, but some resist it and neglect to do anything that might affect their abilities to grow. Clogger is a fungus that eats the seeds of bacteria and different seeds.\n3. Flourscap – This benign seed is currently in bloom, despite the fact that it has been around for decades. The Flourscap can be found in seedless or vegetable crops.\n4. corn fever – Pollen flies, vine-tanned plovers, plankton, snake heads, venomous spiders, and reptiles are among the plant species that spread insect trouble and kill insect larvae throughout the nursery. The unpleasant symptoms include the presence of low to slightly yellowing leaves in the leaves and they have been blamed for the rapid onset of Malaria, Dengue Fever, and cholera. Once bitten, these pests easily transmit these diseases to animals, and to humans.\n5. Blue petunia – A growing plant that will have life again in a couple of years. Unfortunately, there is a short leash leash, and you cannot control the growth of your petunia. It is very difficult to eradicate disease/stress and treatment of its maturation because it had to be kept in a large container.\n6. Beets – Beets tend to slowly die and become slowly eaten, so lose their growth if not treated early.\n7. Insects – Insects were around for so long, they often suffocate you by releasing their minerals which help the body to recover from the stress. In fact, germinating spiders are said to have fast times of theyching them up a notch in maturing and are killed by a mosquito.\n8. Scents – Schmieder believes that scents killed you and stopped you from spending your dinner at home, but it is not true. They have been around for 200 years and account for two-thirds of the world’s Vitamin C deficiency.\n9. T-Rex – This unusual vole can potentially cause severe allergic reactions if placed next to red meat and without proper allergy control. It is said to be a testable virus which breaks into other potential food sources.\n10. Vegan spice – Before you measure for symptoms and for growth, you should exercise all fertilization and evaporation powers of the plant. Burn t-methanol, split into two parts, and use it to remove animal hair and cast or have it released into the wild when it grows into food.\nOne more is for iso – a dry plant that is known to become completely effervescent and go to sleep in less than 24 hours. Be sure to think twice before using or starting any seeds that are fermenting on top of organic matter and that have been cut by the crop.\n']"

1199,Greggs bid to crack 'tribal' Cornwall pasty market,"['The Greggs team behind an outlet in Aberystwyth is dropping a huge party into the U.K. for a new supermarket – and an enterprising young man could win the business.\nMilly Villeneuve has spent £90,000 to find out how to build a supermarket that will cater for the pet nation.\nGreggs, known locally for burgers, have been struggling to attract customers from the places where Meals on Wheels ‘are provided.’ One community, Stanley, started with a few bottles of Olives, turned to Thal Asparagus and Roses for inspiration before Sainsbury’s bought it and has become the first supermarket in the village to offer local edible fruit.\nInitially, it was thought that the new market could bring in £300 to £300 a week to the area of Kings Hall, where the plant ‘cries out’ for customers on weekly visits, but the project never reached that level and the cost is now £150,000 to find out how to sell the ‘tribal’ business.\nFrances Tebbutt, Greggs’ head of marketing and product, said: “We wanted to find the next shoe for the pigbaths – and to serve it in a way that the other supermarkets aren’t able to. It’s a resourceful, hungry, hard-working woman making a fantastic purchase on a Thursday evening in Aberystwyth, this location in Derbyshire.\n“The garden is a farming town, and our customers are a particularity. They want a whole new experience when they walk in the door, and we hope we can really turn that into something else.”\nStaff at the store still labour hard to find a suitable medium and setting sit buyers, but Melia Whiteside, the dedicated manager, said that no other person was willing to turn down a £200-£300 TV licence to go with the 12 sq ft. supermarket.

1200,Are female urinals the answer to queues at the loos?,"['Most could use the help.\nThat’s the theory behind a new mobile app put out by the mobile platform MC App Pro. The app enables women to apply for a male urinal in their male-owned home, but can do it anonymously in a straight forward manner.\nThe contest which launched on Thursday takes an average of eight men a month to apply for a urinal, but usually only a few men per round. Men often don’t apply without permission, a departmental spokesperson confirmed to CNN.\nThe app allows users to complete a simple voter test, while every month, a little girl in Virginia will be allowed to play them. Makers should stay in touch with the user and let them choose who gets its urinal.\n“They come in with that connection on their mobile, but here’s a place where they can just say thanks and walk up to the phone and ask, ‘what do you have here?’ Once a month,” MC App Pro’s host, Ada Mesch , told CNN.\nMariah Carey’s mobile home in Florida in 2016, apparently wanting to get in line for a female urinal.\nMary Philpott describes her at the time as a “prosumer woman.”\nUnlike clippings from a male bathroom patron, a male-owned, female-operated urinal in her home would be a real first.\nPer FTD, however, it’s not as easy as Virginie should be to take one step further. That’s because the service’s designs aren’t editorial-style, but rather designed with some advertising in mind.\n“A Q&A door, for example, and provide a real view of her home where she could see potential customers, along with images of the entrepreneur, on her phone to illustrate their potential sales,” according to TCF, which uses taxis.\nJohn Green, executive vice president of marketing at MC App Pro, says because the app is still in private beta, not all users are required to access it via a phone.\nThe policy is to limit access to individual applications; the charity would only grant access to specific apps and separate applications and limited applications with full provider responsibilities. The charity doesn’t want to jump the middle man.\n“The goal is to reach the widest possible audience,” Green said. “So that’s the way we offer our service…it’s not necessarily advocacy, it’s not necessarily advertising.”\nConsumers can enter once per month through a personal “Q&A” app, which lets a user call the charity about their contacts that match their gender. They can also request a male urinal as well as a female.\n“There’s a different user experience when it comes to using a service that has a lot of privacy features,” Mesch said.\nMany volunteers will be asked to describe their experience with the service. (Unacceptable behavior? Namely garbage curbs.)\nThey’ll also get a T-shirt.\nBut, apparently, programmers can’t take it.\n“People have to learn how to say what the phrase says and that’s not what the person has to say,” Mesch added.\n']"

1202,Smart motorways plan aims to boost safety,"['From a sleek sleek exterior to the posh interior, the Smart Park for Connected Cars project has gone through significant improvements for the city, representing some of the most horrific crashes on the roads around the country.\nAt Ground Zero, a massive traffic tragedy, a parking ramp and the ground floor of a converted military school called Vakon Opal built to make it a safe place for all but the bravest of those taking their yearly vacation at the gym, repairs have been made, a local court was relocated and the parking ramp is now comparable to an office tower.\nBut while dozens of these improvements were made before the tragedy, these improvements occurred at a time when technology might not be so helpful for long term safety. The Smart Park and parking ramp are what saved lives, especially for those with long commutes. Unfortunately, a recent study (pdf) by Navigant’s Insurance Survey (apropos of Navigant’s award-winning series evaluating claims for auto insurance and how drivers experience those expenses) found that too many owners reported delays of at least 2 minutes or more in their car crashes.\nThe reason is simple: cars are so advanced, it is impractical to continually upgrade them. It’s important to consider the underlying reasoning behind this effect when considering a deductible of $1000 or more and achieve continued safety. That remains extremely difficult to achieve with any technology, but it should be particularly important when operating a vehicle in extreme traffic conditions. Only high-quality, technology- and communication-oriented technologies are able to make even the most proficient cars and vehicles crash without rumbling into each other. So with this analysis, Navigant noted that their findings on technology and safety are the opposite of what most other insurance data suggest. In a nutshell, injuries to drivers and victims of a major crash increase by 85%, and deaths are also reduced by 77%.\nMany other studies suggest that cars are driving more independently than in peak times, by a majority of 2%, although that doesn’t mean one driver gets hit with head or neck injuries.\nStill, safety improvements for drivers on all parameters are the same thing. Landings, use of the correct navigation system, etc., are all great improvements in passenger safety, but they are often not implemented until at least before a crash occurs.\nOne approach that seems to work better for most is the Smart Park. Like other approaches to collision mitigation, this technology aimed to increase pedestrian safety, so commuters stay in the loop when approaching traffic on the road. The city explains that it has also turned to overwork to boost pedestrian safety and their ability to hold passengers for as long as possible.\nNot all pedestrian safety measures are found in the Smart Park, at least not on every speed limit or active oncoming moving sidewalks. It is a myth that pedestrian safety is solely caused by cars and traveling quite carefully (it is possible that roadworks causing damage to the flow of traffic can also create avoidance of obstacles), but its true magnitude is less and less because hundreds of thousands of pedestrians die and thousands more are injured each year.\nIn addition to reduced losses for drivers on tight traffic (and making more of them safely disabled), it can also add to costs for apartment dwellers. The Smart Park does not implement optimal pedestrian traffic design for that specific type of traffic. Instead, it can minimize the need for non-lethal assistance such as use of a pedestrian control device like a strong, level of foot and the ability to manually go into a path of traffic. And, of course, pedestrian safety is made more difficult by the increasing presence of cars, making pedestrians less inclined to get out of the way.\nWhen evaluating self-driving cars, another helpful strategy is to watch how fast the car runs to slow down traffic (just not directly, it is much faster), as shown by a recent survey done by the Colorado DMV. All 90 percent of respondents reported that they have engaged in a 75 mph zone early in their driving, which might indicate that they are actively accelerating their driving habits to accelerate traffic. In other words, while they may not be at an optimal velocity, that is a good measure of how fast they are moving, and that in turn can help reduce their chances of injuries and death.\nMost importantly, it allows people to have the options they want when it comes to their car when they choose to drive to work.\n']"
1203,Chelsea Manning case: Judge orders release from prison,"['By Tom Barlow\n(CNN) — An Army sergeant who gained access to former President Barack Obama’s email account while serving as a whistle-blower for WikiLeaks has been ordered released from federal prison.\nPrison officials had sought release in court documents and said Monday the Department of Justice had completed “substantial assistance in obtaining” the papers, according to a letter obtained by CNN. The unnamed inmate was ordered to serve his time before being transferred to federal prison for questioning.\nThe judge approved the release order during a separate court hearing Monday, in which the defendant, 21-year-old Bradley Manning, is said to have denied trying to leak classified data.\nManning, one of the masterminds of the “Dark Knight” hacking scandal, is accused of leaking classified information.\nAt a lengthy hearing Wednesday, a federal judge ordered Manning released without pretrial hearings to move forward with his case in U.S. District Court in San Francisco.\nManning’s defense team is asking for a continuance and argues he isn’t entitled to a new trial because of another criminal conviction — an open-ended statute of limitations.\nPamela Engel, Manning’s lawyer, told CNN she planned to ask the court whether the judge would have granted the pending motion.\n“We appreciate your patience,” Engel said. “But I would note that, like everyone else, we have yet to receive any briefing from this court.”\nAttorneys for the government and Manning’s U.S. attorney filed a joint brief questioning the timing of the June 2016 detainer, which has languished since its release. In the brief, the attorney has asked the court to decide what time period Justice Department lawyers will seek to obtain the documents and the continued implementation of a court-ordered detainer.\nThe court meets once each day.\nAt the time of the detainer, President Donald Trump signed an executive order extending the terms of the detainer. The order lifted the stop-gap provision and set the process a few weeks ago.\nManning was captured by FBI agents from his home in Manning’s hometown of Fort Hood, Texas, in December 2013. One of Obama’s top diplomats in Iraq, Manning is based in Florida.\nCNN has reached out to Manning’s attorneys for comment.\nThe defense contends Manning attempted to obtain classified information from the Defense Department, which was less than 16 months after Obama took office. The judge previously ruled Manning had access to confidential information and withheld it.\nManning was sentenced in December to 20 years in prison for leaking information to the website, WikiLeaks, about soldiers’ rapes, sexual assaults, hostage takers and preparations for the 2010 U.S. invasion of Iraq. The court-ordered detainer is a “hard-right” document the judge decided was secret.\nManning’s attorneys contend the litigation was closed by the sentencing and that he is entitled to a new trial.\nManning was working at Fort Hood at the time of the hack.\n']"
1204,Guinea-Bissau: Political chaos could boost cocaine trade,"['By Sam Leyne\nA West African cocaine-smuggling route could be linked to increased drug trafficking in Guinea-Bissau by Islamic groups and political turbulence in the north of the country, analysts said.\nA spy from the Ministry of Political Affairs (MDE) told the World Drug Report that President Faustino Timbuktu, who departed Guinea-Bissau earlier this week, was traveling with dangerous VIPs including Chief Osama Zamudio, the spy head of the NCMOC, as part of a delegation of EU ministers, the paper said, citing Jean Tegua Achie, the head of the NCMOC.\nAlthough poverty and violence are not new problems for the Franco-Guinea-Bissau government, in the 40 years since President Francisco Bagro Diallo fled with his wife La Marate, separatist forces have attempted to fragment the region.\nNyajine Cahal, a French NGO and rebel leader, told the World Drug Report that criminality in Guinea-Bissau is among the problems affecting the drug industry in the east of the country, saying: “Coles [Belières, a major international cocaine market], which could leave such Colombian narcotics gangs open to the possibility of smuggling the drugs to the West African continent.""\nAccording to Mr. Cahal, the primary driver of illicit drug trafficking is the route via the Côte d’Ivoire–Afrique nationale. ""The organisation of safe passage exists through the movement of arms, drugs and ammo into the majority of illicit trafficking areas in the country,"" he told the World Drug Report.\nThis report warns that the key risk is the emergence of terrorist groups that the country’s security forces are unable to tackle. A 2002 arms embargo still remains to be implemented in the country.\nIn 2018, the estimated cost of fighting the militants in Guinea-Bissau’s northern region stood at $2.6 billion. This figure includes the $800 million costs of the ongoing offensive by the armed forces and security agencies in the south and the budget of the international bloc that provides funding to the conflict.\nMr. Cahal said: “The two major problems in the country today, in terms of the state of lawlessness and security forces, may just be the new drug enforcer.”\nHe added that the polluting activities of military forces have made the task of fighting all the criminals more difficult. He also pointed out that the stability of the country is only guaranteed once there is permanent peace and stability is restored, and that the application of a criminal law is high.\nMr. Cahal was also critical of the Inter-Continental Hotel, which has been guilty of the same high level of violence that has dogged Guinea-Bissau for years, especially when it reopened amid renewed insecurity after the United Nations called for a cease-fire two years ago.\nBut Mr. Cahal said: “As long as the establishment of a militia and the role of police are still considered the state of law, criminal structures inside the political systems must be destroyed or used as a model of resilience.”\nThe West African regional bloc called for a ceasefire, the release of prisoners of war and for the commission of elections that would pave the way for constitutional reform. It said efforts should be made to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in Guinea-Bissau, in areas that are already plagued by civil war and logistical bottlenecks.\n']"

Let’s start with the basics.\nUnvaccinated people with mild to moderate cases of throat infection.\nUp to one-fourth of adults are at risk of lung infections, including the flu and other pneumonia. Other individuals are at a greater risk, and some families do not have room for just one child. At high risk are children younger than five, seniors, pregnant women, married couples with children, single mothers with a child under 12, and those with chronic and severe illnesses.\nThese individuals may or may not have recently been exposed to a lot of Mosquito Invasive Plant (mucp) infection. Symptoms of infection include fever, rash, fatigue, tingling and conjunctivitis. These symptoms generally last from week to week, meaning possible physical illness.\nUnvaccinated people who have not had any physical or sexual tests done this flu season are at a higher risk.\nThe response to Mosquito Invasive Plant (mucp) infection likely changes with age. Mucp infections can recur, possibly after an infection-ridden period.\nMosquito Invasive Plant (muc) environmental changes\nHowever, and for some people that change nothing, be aware that things may still be bad. There are severe illness-related injuries including head, neck, arm, hands, wrist, knee, back, hips, hips and ankles.\nThere are some cases in which you have suffered, possibly, a cold or flu. These victims are usually respiratory infections such as coughs, wheezing, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing. Small amounts of debris can appear when your body goes cold. Among other threats, a sneeze or chills could trigger a viral infection that causes serious illness. See whether you’re taking antibiotics or cold medications that limit air circulation and stimulate immune activity.\nWhen you feel that you are not on the right or maybe the right track, be alert.\nUndiagnosed or not?\nThe closest i is to a “none” because everyone gets the same symptoms. Some will be mild or long-lasting, while others will appear to be “if.” Some people will develop a strong mental reaction as they begin to lose feelings of intimacy and worry about the outside world.\nIf there is a negative reaction to a negative response, don’t get too scared. Take care of yourself. Write this down as soon as possible. Keep track of your symptoms. Text us a message at 2-3 p.m. mw/Q&A or questions. Send your name, phone number and email to galkinson@hotmail.com or call us at 800-227-0249.\nThe researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health published a report on the first vials of Soil Flu Influenza from AZT in January.\nThe report states that the Ariadne family has “been rated as a high-risk family and all of them have started to follow the AZT protocol.” Dr. Luciano Gelauskas, AZT’s lead investigator, said the Ariadne family has been certified an AZT vaccination and will be updated on how to do so.\nYou’ll also want to be sure to keep an eye on the mosquito bites of kids. Studies done for a family that had too many Mosquito Invasive Plant (mucp) infections probably showed the presence of at least one insect-borne disease. When you bite the mosquito bite and take precautions by staying away from them, it seems that even those people who were exposed to Mosquito Invasive Plant (mucp) infections could begin to feel the symptoms of the infection.\nThere are six primary immunizations: Regular screenings, annual vaccinations, the National Kidney Foundation’s combined immunization guidelines for adults and children, anti-tumor refusals, and Avian Influenza. Children must take immunizations if they become well-hydrated, eat a healthy diet, and are exposed to two or more other vaccines for children under 3.\nSOURCE: Journal of the American Medical Association | PHOTO CREDIT: © 2014, CNN Health Network\n']"

Science magazine reported this week that the rodent known as the Plague was virtually eradicated in Asia for more than 2,000 years. It lived in the Americas for over half a century before being wiped out in the United States in 2010. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control, however, said the epidemic was likely to be mild and that B.D. was reported to have been spread there by transmission of natural byes.\nSince the outbreak, Malaysia-based cryptosporidium in the tropical waters of the South Atlantic Ocean has sprouted up in the United States and Canada. And British scientists have reported evidence that there is a rare disease called carbobase-alpha (i.e., colon viruses as we know them) that has also been spread by human sewage.\nIn the absence of the threat of Bratwurst sandwiches, I am convinced that infections in restaurants will arise eventually. And the cost for catching and treating these viruses at home may well be higher than the cost of antibiotics to catch infections in the United States.\nIn a nutshell, these outbreaks are extraordinary in proportion to the massive nature of the virus and its susceptibility to bacteria.\nOver 1,000 years ago, 11,000 animals were killed by the Apriluclei leak, an after-effect of the virus’s absence in Earth’s climate system. Exposure to the bacteria destroyed 100 percent of its immunity. Today’s phobias are so serious that one can run down a lunch-time rampage and squirm and punch someone without feeling the impact.\nAside from the parasitic disease, increasingly more medically important viruses have sprouted in the Middle East, Africa and Europe. The vast spread of viruses to Asia was first introduced in the 18th century and spread rapidly until Russia nearly wiped it out in the mid-19th century. By then, humankind was eating half a billion animals a year.\nThese viruses consume the small intestine, and vaccines, too, may help millions get better by preventing the horrible infection. However, a vaccine against carbobase-alpha, which is pretty much the same as the plague prevention vaccine, could fail to kill the parasite, killing it throughout the body.\nMost successfully, these viruses kill the organism within the first two weeks and then too long for the cause to be normal. A reasonable course of action is to avoid some travelers to the American Northeast who do pass out, as in the case of Carmichael Johnson, an expert on infectious diseases.\nChill out with the bug. Check the corner for airborne diarrheal toxins from the highly infectious respiratory disease E. coli. If an E. coli infection is detected, and an outbreak of the bacteria is detected, your chances of getting sick could be reduced to around half.\nContact us at: .\n']"

A joint Canadian and U.S. intelligence report said Russia and China have a growing but opaque relationship.\nTensions started boiling over April 2, when an American law enforcement official suggested that a Canadian government visit to a Chinese ally to mediate a North Korean standoff.\nMeanwhile, U.S. officials said they had been assured by officials at Canadian border that Pyongyang was blocked from sending a large number of North Korean citizens into Canada.\nIt’s a warning that is reminiscent of Cold War expectations after the Japanese crisis, with the Japanese blamed for lost plans to lift their blockade on the Korean peninsula.\nThe two governments have been buying up U.S. technology and spying secrets for decades, but China, led by President Xi Jinping, has spent the last few years building artificial intelligence capabilities, for example, based on its military presence in Vietnam.\nA high-level Chinese intelligence official traveled to Canada on Wednesday and told a caucus meeting that the relationship with Canada is safe, according to a person with direct knowledge of the discussions.\nAlso, a senior person with direct knowledge of the discussion told CNN there was “stronger information” from Russian officials about the Chinese visit and North Korean activities.\nBut the Canadian official said there was no evidence of it.\n“There’s been not a single party in Canada about that,” the official said, adding, “We’re talking to them all.”\nOne potential issue is whether the visit will reflect a commitment toward cyber security, the source said.\nThe U.S. government is concerned about China buying power as a result of its theft of U.S. data, and an American official said some Canadian companies have been under pressure.\nTrump’s administration also has a murky relationship with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, the source said. Both will have to build up contacts and relationships, according to the source.\nAlpine Country, a notable tourist destination, is a prime U.S. area for tourism.

Jeff Davis.\nIt was not immediately clear how the US or Kurdish fighters could be located, said Davis.\nThe Kurds sought to broker peace between the Iraqi government and the PKK, which is fighting for independence in the central and western regions of Kurdistan. It says US sanctions have prevented those deals.\nThe level of US military activity raised questions about the motives of the joint strike and about the usefulness of a pre-emptive strike, said Lt.

Gen. James S. Ryan, commander of the US Central Command, confirmed Monday that a drone had tracked a PKK-linked fighter whose location and location was not known.\nRyan declined to discuss specific details but said the US is continuing to evaluate the strikes with the Kurdish fighters as they ramp up their activities, including fighting militants during the fighting against Iraqi forces.\nThe strike took place in Kirkuk late Saturday.\nRamraz Bakhtiar, a Kurdish separatist leader, said that Kurdish fighters had attacked the base because US troops and military advisers had there.\n“We don’t understand how we could have planned this,” Bakhtiar said at a news conference in Baghdad Sunday. “When you look at the calculations this might have been made: We (Iraqi troops) wanted to go to the southern region.

We believed he had a small plane running down,” the crew member said.\n“He said there were at least two guys running down from the other side of the plane. There weren’t a lot of people in the first-to-second side, where there was almost like one guy on each side. He said somebody flying down from the other side was running so it was almost like one man’s jumping in.”\nWhen planes come over into the plaza, the small section being used for travelers is meant to signal their intention to go around.\n“You can’t be doing that, it’s absolutely inconceivable,” said Ashley Megild, who was on the building’s 30th floor when the crash occurred.\n“I’m not sure if this was because of the crash, but it’s looked like he was out of the plane before it went down.”\nCNN has been reaching out to officials at the nearby World Trade Center and in the Ground Zero lobby, but they told us that the last will and testament of an ex-pat flew near the crash site and another was found in a building neighboring the scene of the crash.\nRepresentatives for the World Trade Center’s six floors have since been contacted and two of those were placed under travel restrictions.\nThousands of people have been affected by the fire, the explosion and explosion at the World Trade Center and the 9/11 attacks that took the lives of 50,000 people.\n']"

Cough down!"" and ""Take the water.""\nThat prompted the government to invite rallies around the country this weekend, urging their followers to challenge the anti-corruption maneuvers deployed in parliament and the lower house.\nThe rallies are the first since May 2, when dozens of riot police and pro-government soldiers attacked the main office of the chamber government in charge of constitutional reform. The police retreated, leaving behind police vehicles and the opposition rallying around the bases.\nProtests on Saturday in Bangkok and elsewhere followed signs that the May 2 attempt to give the parliament a majority was to fail.\n""We\'re standing with the protesters,"" opposition leader Suthep Thaugsuban told reporters.\nThe government\'s move to give the parliament a majority and deemphasize the opposition steps would show that Thailand is fracturing under the weight of corruption scandals in the country, pushing it too far to put an end to economic growth.\nSome blame the government\'s latest development on Suthep\'s general incapacity to tackle corruption, but others tout his unprecedented government reform that aims to lower the city government\'s power and avoid tax evasion by merchants.\nThe latest government reform is the first to fully go into effect since Thailand\'s former monarchy fell in 1991.\nOn Wednesday, it took the first step toward enacting the reforms through changes to the charter of the constitution.

We request that the best compromise between our demands and the demands of the governing coalition and the opposition forces is made before the reforms can be implemented.""\nThe action against Suthep and six other top government officials has highlighted a disagreement with the opposition in parliament over how to tackle corruption.

But the medical regulator says Gardasil is not unsafe for human use, but it is irresponsible, because it is not safe to give vaccines to people without the risk of disease or a particularly severe form of immune deficiency.\nRobertson has pointed out in open letters to Turnbull that a major error in diagnosis and the safety of vaccines for everything from cockfighting to cancer is that people need only high-dose doses and thus the government is not acting in the best interest of the health of the population.\nStill, he says “meltdown” could occur in the case of global new disease. Vaccines are routinely delayed, vaccines are discounted and the system of treating all active diseases is under attack.\nI’m not saying that’s not the problem, but I am saying that it is a very, very, very wrong view of what it is to be a leader of a health care system with no transparency, no openness.\nThat includes saying that Australia’s government is about more than dumping the vaccination program, as if to say that it is either mentally incompetent or is unable to provide what it wants.\nWhat’s the big deal?\nAustralian deaths\nAccording to the Australian Institute of Public Health, the killer of between 1,271 and 1,870 people in the past 10 years has been a man. While the numbers for human-caused deaths are small and are most likely a result of strains of influenza, the same over-reliance on vaccines as in the United States will result in over-production of vaccines.\nMore than half the killings have occurred in Australia, according to the World Health Organization.\nAustralia is the world’s largest health care service for every nation, provided a primary care environment that fosters the engagement of healthcare professionals, as in hospitals, family support agencies, health information systems, and health clinics and health-care services.\nAccording to the Brennan Centre for Justice in the United States, an estimated 600,000 people die from infectious diseases each year. According to the NIH, 1 in 4 people worldwide have the virus that causes human disease or is responsible for that death.\nAt the federal level, the report on this disease estimates that the number of deaths caused by human-caused diseases, which are primarily caused by the vaccines, is estimated to be 60,000.\nRoughly 50 million of the deaths are in the United States, with figures representing 100 million deaths worldwide. Most deaths have been in Asia.\nIndia is a notable example of a country without meaningful national health care, with an estimated five million deaths from communicable diseases every year.\nThe percentage of all deaths attributed to various forms of disease in India is in the one-quarter range.\nThe number of deaths in developing countries, which include India, Russia, China, the Caribbean, Jamaica, the Philippines, and New Zealand, is estimated to be under 400,000 annually.\nThe Bauhaus theory says that the one in 20 most severe diseases are caused by human-caused diseases.\nAn additional 10 million deaths in the world each year are attributed to infectious diseases, according to its molecular analysis.\n']"

1225,Coronavirus: How to clean your smartphone safely,"['Keep your smartphone safe.\nA California dermatologist and researcher says the world’s most frequent infection for most people isn’t even eating this particular cell phone. It’s a brain cell linked to immune infections, a particular cell-cell cyclical tick in the body.\nWhile it’s not a confirmed case of Coronavirus, infections happening with the digital world are happening. You know, where people suffer from a sickness which they think will kill them, or possibly cause big injury when they fall. Those symptoms are known as Coronavirus jabs, and they’re sometimes caused by form of inflammation in the brain or elsewhere.\nSo as many as 2.6 million people are treated for Coronavirus-related illnesses worldwide annually, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nMost Coronavirus cases are avoided by using a protective device. But some technologies can even be taken advantage of. One is MicroLite, developed by Georgia Tech Health and Injury Research Institute of Atlanta, which uses simple but serious ways to replace old phones with microplastic for only about 10 cents per charge.\nThey use a recessed silver pouch that attaches to the smartphone, at or near the tip of a metal tripod. Microplastic is a fluid, patient-friendly material that can withstand a continuous treatment within hours.\nBecause microplastic is a soluble polymer, it doesn’t break up easily. By separating small chunks of malignant tissue from the cells, microplastic can avoid damaging cells while shedding others. The plastics get sticky enough to travel onto medical equipment, which can kill and leave us all baffled. The bit on the other end of MicroLite’s packaging gets too odorous.\nEven before MicroLite’s sales began more than five years ago, the industry was buzzing about it. Small bottles of microplastic in bags and cartons changed hands. Microplastics were hard to find, and the bags had to be placed in plastic stores, creating a barrier between the bag and an injured patient. The packaging became unusable, the condition going into oblivion. Some even labeled it as the “MicroLite Pad.”\n“If you don’t like microplastic items, you shouldn’t buy them,” lead researcher Dr. Tom Savage said. “That’s the reason we think microplastic is so dangerous.”\nWith microplastic, MicroLite can break up in seconds. If you have medical equipment that turns out to be old, microplastic may be as problematic as a smartphone. If you bought your device when it came to purchasing what you thought was good quality, microplastic can break up easily and result in a certain type of tissue rupture.\nMicroplastic biopsy strips will be used to smooth out dead cells from tumor tissue, allowing the patient to be discharged and spent at rest. Microplastic strips are fast-growing and easily installed, so they don’t lose shape. So they are expensive. They’re fairly common and less widespread.\nSavage and his colleagues developed a program to diagnose and treat thousands of Cell Lite cells, including some with symptoms of Coronavirus. They use microplastic strips to remove tiny bits of tissue, like sections of a prostate gland, out of a cell. Doctors give them to the patient to analyze, take temperature readings, and then send those results to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Colorado at Colorado Springs, where surgery is scheduled to begin within three weeks. The procedure costs anywhere from $600 to $300,000.\nThe procedure is most common in the rural area, where cancer is prevalent. It also is done under controlled conditions, with a lot of wireless privacy.\nThe team does not have the perfect approach to the procedures, Savage said. “This is a new technology that will improve the care of cancer patients by enhancing their security,” he said.\nFor now, the team is operating at patients at Colorado Springs in an elderly patient ward and in a busy hospital at the University of Colorado. It’s making phone calls so far. After they complete the tests, they hope to perform a successful surgery.\nStaff writer Eric Russell contributed to this report.\n']"
1226,Coronavirus: Indian greeting namaste goes global,"['India has gone global with “namaste” greeting in honour of its emperor, Queen N. Nariman, and “chhe ki, nahi kon nikhan kaon ke muka hai.” The trend and its setting up in India went global in the first few days of April. Some of the boldness was observed in the embassy building for the purpose of visiting namaste. On April 4, the government, the Union Ministry of Planning and Development and some official delegations were present to visit India, to visit the namaste. Both the official Embassy of India and the Embassy of Nalinnath, understood by the Indian embassy to be in Lucknow, agreed to visit and there was the enthusiasm. The content of the greeting could not be noticed in the press without the visiting namaste taking place.\nAccording to the Unicef, the “Namaste” is the response to a manifestation of past diseases like HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, etc. killing about 2.5 million people per year in India. World health is rife with the involvement of actors, strategists, social groups, corporate entities, pharmaceutical industries, civic stakeholders, politicians and non-governmental organizations, including NGOs, bodies from government, universities, NGO’s, Buddhist temples, religious leaders and others, to set up namaste for Indian people.\nIt is estimated that more than 9 million people die of diseases every year. Such diseases, human beings share with the other individuals who suffocate in the dark and subhuman stages of life. The idea of namaste, a greeting or a holy message on the part of a kind people, is associated with Buddhist teachings and receives from various religions as well.\nThus, it is the tourism industry that promotes the greeting. Many corporate firms and many NGOs are active on such occasions. They interact with people to build personal trust. In September, 2016, a fresh lukewarm greetings session by the ministry of civic affairs, attended by over 15,000 NGOs, met with more than 1,200 villagers, mainly in Jammu and Kashmir, and consulted with over 100 government officials.\n“The best is how you make the Holy Being interactive. In India, a greeting does not see the face. You touch it, but you ignore the face,” Dr. Chhatib Patel, a senior representative of WWF, told this paper.\nSpeaking about setting up neamaste (namaste) gatherings in the presence of senior officials and informers, Mr. Anand Ponnandan, the spokesperson for the ministry, told CNN’s Imam, “We are happy that things are moving fast and growing.” At one point, many namaste activities were conducted in temples, in public places, in houses, schools, workplaces, clubs and even in villages.\nThe objective is to set up villages and establish community units, stores, hotels, restaurants, and malls. The late merchant and businessman in this age of globalisation spoke of keeping the foreign policy flippant. It is not possible to try to post the greetings in secret, although communication should be provided otherwise.\nFrom next March, a mass message of “namaste” in public will be handled by all professional fraternities of Indian tribe, devotional and spiritual communities, etc. through the medium of e-rickshaw and “g”_rickshaw. These groups will meet to elect officials, attend mass, consult each other’s messages and discuss matters of national importance. For instance, these organisations will meet on the issues of education, science, technology, sports, terrorism, good governance and judicial or ethical behavior, leaving their agenda of those matters to the bishop.\nOn April 2, hundreds of namaste services were held in various temples. Kerala saw a recording of the meeting and its nature, to avoid clashes, declared a “decent day for namaste”. At another (Rajai Delhi), visit of clerics on five different occasions where a chhe ki.naz muka hai tikkhan aa.\nAt the launch of The Bag Shub – “Golden Guide to Trip”, Gujarat state religious leader, Madhu Sudhir Kumar, told the gathered, “Shubh kar bha hai” (a prayer says, “Your work means you have shown the world of goodness”).\nFirst Published: Apr 05, 2019 15:00 IST\n']"
1227,Dr Anthony Fauci explains failure of testing in the US,"['WASHINGTON (CNN) — A former career CIA officer on Tuesday defended the agency’s experimental testing of new brain scans for partial blindness in the US.\nAnthony Fauci, the former director of the National Security Agency, made his comments to CNN from a facility in San Diego that is nearly 75% staffed with computer equipment for testing new cognitive processing tools.\n“We get a huge crowd of people, and a lot of that crowd is from the dark arts, and the kind of innocent viewing that is in this product,” he said.\nThe president has no public explanation for what was uncovered in January as part of a $4 billion purchase of a VA medical facility. Nevertheless, the images revealed public health risks for the images, which said that some veterans will be weakened by a partial blindness that occurs through traumatic brain injury.\nThe data showed severe brain damage in some of the post-9/11 images, Fauci said. While the images of brain tumor of a poster child for palliative care might be convenient for some people suffering from partial blindness, he believes that many will escape a potentially long waiting period.\nFor instance, if a fighter pilot is still in combat, military officials have regulations specifying that all tests must include the government’s primary diagnosis of partial-blindness. Also, if an astronaut test is forthcoming, the government can monitor the results.\nFauci said that some people, particularly veterans and younger people who have suffered seizures or other forms of pre-displaced epilepsy, will simply escape the screening altogether, and do not need MRI scans to do so. Some patients cannot even obtain a CT scan in the U.S., he added.\n']"
1228,How to sign a digital document,"['In these times of global uncertainty and rapid economic growth, experts are feeling more sure than ever about the security and privacy of digital data. And they\'re finding that a lot of details are there.\nFrom online calendars to passwords to photos and chat messages, digital document documents are easily accessed, often to the point of missing or later having an error on their paper form, said Larry Keig, a technology security analyst for San Francisco-based Symantec.\n""People get into their print form and it doesn\'t look good when you see that document every now and then,"" he said.\nGeometric security can be a problem here. Money documents — essentially printed inkjet printers, scratch paper and other digital biometric checks — can come with fines for theft.\nKeig said people are finding the latest version of Adobe PhotoPlate could be the most secure document repository, since users also can keep passwords on their electronic device.\nBut if you really need to figure out what kind of digital document is left behind — or what to delete from the digital version in the process — you\'ll need an iPhone or iPad.\n""To get you to use these types of documents, you have to have that mobile phone you have,"" Keig said.\nBest Practices from digital document security firm NIST\nThe availability of digital document document storage is itself a concern for a growing number of businesses. Even though mobile devices are becoming more widely used, organizations don\'t yet have any digital tax account for photo rentals or sharing, according to NIST.\n""Often our business is a service provider,"" Keig said.\nResearch firm Rethink Technology found that more than 50% of website visitors used digital files for banking, travel, bookings and other financial transactions.\nBut most of those customers are likely inexperienced and aren\'t quite ready to add digital documents to their notes.\nIn fact, Rethink Research indicated there are thousands of websites (around 2,800 in Sweden and 4,800 in the U.S.) that don\'t have scanners. The same could be true for photo rentals and other digital documents.\n""I\'m looking for something that they have that really, really good coverage of the privacy and document security needs,"" Rethink Research President Sean Pavlish said.\nIt\'s easy to put digital documents into paper form or get them in the mail. But dealing with that kind of information is relatively simple.\nIn fact, there are instructions on how to maintain your digital documents in digital form, said Horizon E-Transport Project Director Sharon Halliwell.\n""I get this letter, once, where there\'s not a whole lot of information stored. I see a picture on my mailbox, but nothing is marked in it,"" Halliwell said.\nAnd the plan to archive your digital documents is quite simple.\n""I need a set copy of the project, which is sort of just a software, and then put this project on it, and finally, I\'ve got a digital master copy,"" Halliwell said.\nSome companies, like Google, have solutions for customers who create digital documents, including a version of IE11 for WordPress. But they are unlikely to be trusted. In fact, some customers prefer to use downloads of their digital documents rather than a print application, Halliwell said.\nTo really know what\'s there in a digital document, here are five things to know:\n1. The document should be clear, but not even well-defined. You should know the password for the document you use, and you should hold the document file in shredder.\n2. The document is not a guaranteed safe. Most firms will assign users a separate address, which means that many websites where users come from may come under fire for violating employee privacy.\n3. You\'ll want to keep an accurate log of the progress of the documents, particularly if they have significant errors. You should also remember passwords.\n4. Once it is disabled, use a secure gateway, or pushcode, to access the digital copies and delete them. The flaw isn\'t easy to crack, so employees should speak with a trusted authority such as a professional account manager or a password protection expert to find the exact address or password in their final security management process.\n5. If you do manage to delete a digital document, opt for the digital release program from each organization.\nThese five tips apply equally to digital document management software and custom apps.\nAlso, you might want to keep your passwords safe online, said Shawn Vinger of the Pew Internet & American Life Project.\n']"

1234,Saviour of the dead: Burying the bodies India forgets,"['Riza Maykoon, 45, is the country’s most trusted guide to finding the body of his friend. “I go to over 100 funerals, and this time is different,” said Maykoon.\nMaykoon died in India’s Pathania district of western Uttar Pradesh in February after going missing for 11 days. In an interview with this website, Maykoon said that he did not miss any funerals. “Many of my friends, they were in sleep and I don’t like to hear about that,” he said. “I want to focus on healing.”\nHis case is, of course, most important because he was last seen alive on Feb. 12. Though Uttar Pradesh authorities are not yet releasing details about what transpired, it is clear that Maykoon was killed shortly after he was reported missing. The police said the death was due to a lack of communication between the two. Maykoon’s abduction was the deadliest in his life, a fact which investigators are struggling to understand. (An email sent to Dharmendra Kaur, the home secretary in the Uttar Pradesh capital, Lucknow, reported that a villager who was recording the DNA on Maykoon’s camera said the body was stuck between two DNA markers.) “Relatives of the deceased asked the family to take care of the family members too. The deceased’s parents could not send anyone to retrieve the body for some time,” said a police official in Lucknow. (The presence of the missing person’s family can be gauged with the presence of those living with the victim. Some people, especially those relatives of the deceased, are annoyed when questions of the missing person’s identity are left unanswered.)\nPartly, Maykoon’s problems are explained by the fact that his GPS locator was at the site of his disappearance. But the GPS’s location is also vital: Even on an 8-kilometer map, it would not be clear how long it was taken from the location. A map of Uttar Pradesh, like Sharma’s, would be different from that of the rest of the country.\nMaykoon had lived near the border in Uttar Pradesh for several years when he took his family back home in the late 1990s. His brother and sister met from prison in 1983 to practice at a camp after a family of paupers detained him and his wife for poaching their cattle. Maykoon found his way back to the camps near his flat, where his partner and others were living. The wife and his partner began questioning the men around him.\nThey had broken their trance to visit the den, where they interrogated the men about their daily lives in order to find out what happened to their wife.\nAfter the women returned, she engaged in conversations with the men, telling them that she had vanished. She and the wife did not tell the men what happened to her. They stayed put for nearly three months, and continued talking about their (swearing) experiences of living at the camp. None of the men, even the two accused, acknowledged that they had disappeared.\nThe main question they had to answer was that of the women. The men said they had gone to Birbhum village, a village in Uttar Pradesh, where Maykoon had gone. Maykoon had come home two days after his body was found. Once they had returned, a group of men and women with him left for their homestead, where they collected the body, wrote a testament to Maykoon’s life, and explained where the dearest people were. The men and women replied that they did not know where Maykoon was. The men, she added, did not know where he was.\nWhen pressed further, the men and women said they did not even know where his body was found.\nFew people, in general, remember the differences between Maykoon and Sharma. Those who know Maykoon say that he was an intelligent student and was given just one exam. Sharma, on the other hand, was not a good student; he had reportedly been tortured by the police twice.\nFollow stories like this at YourTango.\n']"

Here in this country, 3.6 million high-heels men expressivity and sexual activity regularly. Yet, its on the street where the people enjoy food and entertainment. No amount of their toiletries can bring the level of sexual arousal the male, female or couple are accustomed to. Dear Editor, us further need to improve the situation of the ladies. In the country where women desire their sexual desires, here we have a huge shortage of all the males, a situation that they have never encountered before. Around 98% of men do not identify with one gender, and the only way for men to access this information is by sending a ‘SAVVAYRY’ about their place in the world. To solve this problem they refer to the feminine qualities, and avoid sexual gratification.\nAnother reason for running short of men is the failure to have males only urinate on themselves. Yikes! Click on the two lines and you will see men simply urinate not on themselves. It is an inexcusable truth. Regarding female toilets, what can be done? Push the button. Provide reproductive services. The locker rooms are accessible to the male and female. Equal opportunity. There is no way for any male to enter into an sexually enjoyable workplace, not least because of the lack of access to feminine facilities. The door for men to enter into an unsafe and social environment is not one of the most attractive for males, therefore, giving a policy is anathema to the thinking of women. It is unfortunate that a policy of women’s access is hijacked by men. Only those who want to know more will be impressed.\nSpeaking about the issue, I have noticed a resurgence of issues where two men were on opposite sides. In other words, male and female were using each other as punks, while female utilisation to women. I have been badly harmed by this where it seems men were using female colleagues to harass our female colleagues. Must we do away with male stereotype as the male norm and use the female’s vagina to provoke the male’s perspective in an inciting way? Put an end to this! Or, should we consider open homosexual recruitment for men? A story of a seventy-something woman and her sex partner laying in wait for men to meet her husband for the night. Does her husband suggest that she may prefer this option to her husband? I can only presume that both husband and wife needed this ‘don’t ask but answer’ question so much for it to be defeated. By including the comment of none other than the ‘afl’, it helps to encourage men and their partners to give their best.\nYours faithfully,\nFrustrated and yearning For Rape\n']"

Many are migrants who arrived in Europe without an appointment, or have family members who are killed in the conflicts in their home countries.\nPresident Trump recently announced a plan to decouple Americans from military immigration into a citizenship program, creating the phasing-out of 18,000 deferral deferral cases nationwide.\nThousands of refugees who arrived in Europe in 2015 by choice now are on the run, and military officials are asked to step in to help.\n“The effect of the humanitarian crisis that is occurring in Europe today is greater than we thought,” said Valerie Laurence, Policy Director at the American Civil Liberties Union. “We hope that the European Court of Human Rights will require that the authorities are legally responsible for harboring the most dangerous people.”\nPresident Trump has faced many challenges during his presidency.\nIn late February, he visited a U.S. prison to hear from people who were processed at U.S. military bases and made a decision.\n“While we can’t justify the atrocities that they’ve committed, we understand that they were hardly unknown,” President Trump said. “They stood guard at a facility here in America, watched American citizens at home go on hunger strikes, and are portrayed as heroes, whether on television or in court.”\nPresident Trump and the Department of Homeland Security last month released the names of 1,000 inmates from Britain’s Metropolitan Police Service (MPIS) that had been indicted on charges of the murder and sexual assault of a soldier.\nMost are under overburdened with criminal and immigration procedures, and their names have been being handed over to a judge for deportation, and 30,000 other alleged criminal suspects from Libya, Italy, and Greece have been granted asylum or refugee status in European Union nations.\nThis migration pattern has been building for years, and the Trump administration has not stepped up or slowed it down.\n“Defunding our airports is unprecedented, but the de facto rule is denying refugees and other refugees of any sense of security,” said Eric Lefkofsky, who teaches immigration law at Washington State University. “We need to be clear about what’s legitimate and what is not.”\n']"

In the wake of a crime investigation that\'s classified as a ""state crime"" and released publicly to the media Thursday, President Bozize conceded that he was setting up a ""compromise"" government.\n""There will be an eventual politicisation of the electoral system,"" he said during a three-day visit to the central African country.\nBut there are serious concerns about seeping in with the new political environment.\n""Insecurity has multiplied. Factors that will prevent a normal political process will flourish, which could be a source of instability. The stock market has been volatile,"" his ministry of finance official Joaquim Tavares told AFP, explaining that investors have been concerned that too much had been done for too long.\n“This could be the most unpredictable and costly period of the transition to change in a long time,"" he added.\nThe criminal groups largely run money for political purposes while donors are still largely ruling elites, blamed for the mess the nation has made since it fell from grace.\nA little over a year ago, there was a resurgence of street protest groups in the streets of capital Conakry, but they largely abandoned their peaceful action to increase more violence.\nThe police have curbed their sentences but remain an organised and civilian group, often with only state support and ammunition.\nAlready, the president has accumulated a rash of corruption allegations, with former Finance Minister Delysa Cunha having received around $4 million in bribes for fixing a project to take copper out of Liberia.\nBozize has dismissed concerns from some of the opposition that his rule is being rigged in favor of the government.\nThe referendum this year for a new constitution is due by July 30. But opposition parties have expressed concern about a delay in taking the referendum seriously.\nCurrent laws empower the government to cut spending and approve projects from budget until it shows ""clearance"" from the constitution.\nAnalysts say that if the Electoral Commission is rigged in favor of a single candidate, the process will have become more dubious. It would also increase the risks of conflicts between the government and opposition, potentially widening the election to try to determine who represents whom.\nThe Socialist opposition is also concerned by the fact that the anti-government opposition has yet to register in the polls, which could in turn boost the government\'s chances.\nThe Social Democrats are doubtful that election authorities will handle the vote properly. But they\'ll rather use the help of undercover police posing as victims.\nThe Christian Science Monitor\'s Germaine Baume explains the challenges to an already a democratic government:\n']"

The bouncing tee-h pants to the chorus goes “who d you sitin there with!” with the men bop, according to a clip by debonte michaelson. “5 oz, swell,” he says to me. “Do you even know what I’m trying to hide? Why is it that I’m stuck in the toilets with at least one cup of milk?”\n“I was talking with you.” she yells at him, as he puts his face in his mouth. “God knows what.”\n“Uh,” he says, and tells her he’ll never stop wrestling her. “Forget about weightloss,” she says, leaning for the camera. “I am far more confident that I can get the Super Bowl pictures online, literally.”\nI immediately think that his existence is an online hoax, or some combination of two or three. I wonder whether he’ll believe it, but I realize that, according to some reports, he and Peaches Geldof’s kids have several overlapping jobs. “She plays house cleaner,” I say to Mr. Ellie, “we have kids to do together all the time.”\n“She’s not in the habit of talking to guys about sex,” I say. “She is a regular user of raunchy videos.” The one woman I’ve seen advertised on JDate’s website had a “inconclusive video just…” He says we were at the mall and he played a video in front of us. And I’m not exaggerating when I say “inconclusive”.\nBut when I tell the story, he tells me again that it’s a hot mess, neither of whom can hear the conversation either, and which he absolutely refuses to attend to. “What do you think of this?” he asks I. The bottom line, of course, is that, no matter how uncomfortable he’s in, or how out of touch with what’s happening on the internet, if he gives his piece of pizza to someone and they ruin it with smeared rotten eggs they won’t need him again.\nHe refuses to discuss anything else; instead, he tells me that’s a nightmare all through the whole hotel room and we must be together at some point. “To our close friends,” he says, “partners, one another.” Then, up on the shittery balcony, he slowly shakes his head and says, “Exactly,” and so both of us go down to watch the people rise up out of the air and hit it in the bag. By this point you could tell he’s been deceiving me.\nNow all I know is that he’s almost literally joking. “Are you kidding me?” I say, watching e-mail filters spread like pimples, though he breaks down into a whisper. “Oh,” he says, brushing his teeth. “That’s New York, thanks.”\n“When did you know this, Dave?” I say, still contemplating all the complaining and coffee I’m consuming. “I had a friend tell me the worst thing he had ever done for me was show up to work early in the morning.”\n“This is me,” he says.\n“Hi Doc,” I say. “What can I do to get you off my path?”\n“Can I get rid of this garbage?”\n“No,” he says. “You can just get on my list.”\n“Can I send something to you,” I say.\n“I’m not bad,” he says. “Go ahead and send it.”\n“Listen. I have trouble in a bathroom, and I have a wide, protruding bum. How can I possibly get you out of this?” I’m wondering how old he is.\n“A 30-year-old? I think I’m 29,” he says']"
1241,Blasian love: The day we introduced our black and Asian families,"['Sugar be is what your family loves most.\nIf you love it, you’re going to love things the way it is. But if you don’t love your family, it’s only going to get worse.\n“When we first came into Jamaica, I wasn’t sure if we were going to be our own people or what,” says one black and Asian family in Jamaica, say. “We were living ourselves.”\nHumbug and their parents, both immigrants, learned English while they were young. All went to boarding school; their house owners looked after the families.\nInitially, one group agreed to let them live. The others didn’t. They were “just immigrants.” A pair of black and Asian families decided to start families. So, on March 12, 1938, they were released from the isolation they had made in Jamaica. They were served turkey schnitzel, a street snack.\nAs sisters, Kwame, Josiah and Dawn were able to get a married pair of parents, Frederick and Barbara Phillips, together they finally got married. My cousin Adam Lee, from Jamaica, and his brother Errol were equally happy.\nI have never seen children like this. They are like the cosy saloons of a small American East Indies town. It’s hard to imagine anything but the unwashed, ruddy smiles that they share every night.\nWhen they met Dawn, a 4-year-old girl who she danced with the entire time she was pregnant, they became fast friends. In fact, she worked as a paralegal in the bookstore. She even went on a marriage attempt with a role model she knew and worked hard to impress.\nThe whole family soon grew acquainted, with Dawn even dating a new dog and a son, Benjamin.\nTwo months later, like the couple as a whole, her dress matched Dawn’s. Just days after birth, her first child, Noah, was born, and the birth marks the birth of the couple’s child. And Dawn’s little brother, Spencer, who will now live with his mother and stepmother, Devon.\nBut even more so, though the connection made sense to the family as members, their youngest son, Kisha, remained almost 14 months old. Years later he decided to settle down with his maternal grandmother.\nMaybe their relationship helped them chart a new path and filled their huge void. As unlikely families are in Jamaica today, they left a small legacy for all to deal with.\n“Through our parents and their work, our lives, we gave them some confidence that they could be successful,” says Dawn. “But we didn’t want them to make it in a white world. We also wanted them to feel what it felt like to be well-rounded. I want them to understand they are always being looked at as individuals and not as royalty, and we need to remember that.”\n“On your day off, your mom would come home and tell you everything she ever wanted to know about your day,” concludes another black and Asian family who loved their parents.\n“At our wedding, our wedding story didn’t end with our couple accepting and sharing marriage vows. This was our first chance at establishing a lifelong bond and a source of solid foundation for future generations. We did not feel truly entitled to everything they had achieved. None of our family came to Jamaica at the same time. One of our brothers gained admittance to citizenship for his father after 40 years; my aunt gained special privileges for a very interesting reason, being an artist, and then she would leave home. But we started to look forward to owning an American owned business for a second chance. We knew something important was important, and one of the things that we accomplished together, is to build a new society.”\nFor more from Sugar Be, visit\n']"

""We didn\'t even have our house, and that\'s how it started. We were messing around. And then in the last month or so, whenever Melissa, who was my favourite host, went on the show, she changed.""\nOver the years, PPDJ has cultivated a persona of — well, not quite as — \'tikTok\' in the households she works in.\nAfter her much-heralded move to Los Angeles to star in ""Glee,"" she did an improv show with a team of writers who also played sit-coms and afterward went back to the game.\n""I didn\'t set out to be a \'tikTok\' because I didn\'t want to get booked on TV.

After one that ended in her falling out with Bruce Willis, she was able to negotiate a starring role in another remake of ""X-Men"" with Fox.\nAfter she signed on for ""TikTok"" that movie, she\'s looking to make a living off of it.\n""I\'m a little more a twinklady now, but I would love to do it — it\'ll be a great show,"" she said. ""I love my phone constantly and I wouldn\'t mind getting in my car and driving around outside for a couple hours — she\'s good. And that\'s just a great way to keep your discipline and keep your mind active.""\nDoes it make a difference?\n""The celebrity thing affects people\'s lives,"" said Meryl Weiner, a Denver-based psychologist and professional mixologist who blogs about drug addiction and celebrity addiction. ""Maybe the celebrity thing affects people\'s lives. Maybe people buy celebrity status because they know the stories, then they buy the hype and then get completely besmised.""\nWeiner said it helps to ""save that stuff.""\n""In today\'s industry you kind of have to have that protectiveness,"" she said. ""With our celebrity culture, you\'re going to have a lot of people watching you for attention and you really don\'t want to just watch your huge celebrity status for a couple of hours.""\nWeiner said making a living from celebrity status also helps the producers for the series, because not everyone is going to be a star; it also doesn\'t hurt to learn from those who don\'t actually make money.\n""Celebrity is a really easy thing to get into that comfort zone, where people who, how and where they\'re living as celebrities may not be very worried about making money,"" Weiner said. ""I think that\'s great because it helps find the right balance, where the industry is being represented and the team is just returning it for a different character.""\nAnd since she graduated from Colorado University in New York in 2016, she\'s not sure where to go for a treatment career. But, as she said, ""I don\'t care. This is the gift I\'ve got.""\n""I\'m an actor! I want to be a doctor!"" she said. ""I\'m really looking forward to this.

The county is assigned to help set up after-school programs that are generally created by parent volunteers.\nWhen contacted about the case in February, superintendent Mike Debke said the school district had no comment.\nOne of the boys\' mother\'s husband was responding to the complaints, and the school district sent him an e-mail denying that information that existed and reprimanding him for having inappropriate conversations with the boys in the school\'s recreation hall. He was punished for using cell phones that were concealed in his door.\nThe initial problem with the school system was revealed by a person who saw a student writing an e-mail on a teen\'s arm. The area has been marked as safe for children, and early detection is a very important consideration as young adults are vulnerable to being victimized in the first place.\n""The unfortunate reality is that the sexual predator reported has been housed in that building,"" Debke said.\nThe mother was stunned to learn she hadn\'t been notified of the incident until this week. She has said that she did not know what had happened until her son, who also happens to be a student at the school, saw the child\'s school yearbook.\n""I don\'t know how long it has been.

1244,Confessions of a call-centre scammer,"['By Annette Jones\nGot a call home? If it’s a pesky slip, beware of recurring calls to a call center, says an expert in identity theft protection.\nPeter Huard told CNN he’s lost roughly $200 to $300 in expensive customer service calls last week. He says the problem lies in the complex notion that a call center costs only what the calls cost.\n“The most nefarious kind of call centers try to order a call as many times as they can to get better quality of service, and often times add on money,” Huard said.\nBut experts say many call centers pay only what they think customers want, meaning that the action is only really worth what the profit margin is.\n“They’re better off deciding to do things properly, and be transparent with the customer about the type of calls and how the service is really going to work,” Huard said.\nBut it doesn’t get a pass from the commercial service providers, he added.\nHe may be paying the same premium for calls that aren’t ordered, but the cost of entry can be a huge percentage.\nWhen the wrong call comes up, a call center will ask you to fill out an affidavit confirming the call is yours, in case your bank never called, he said.\n“The phone can ask if you’re a customer of a bank so it can tell you how big the loan is, but if you don’t take it, it is not even that important for a call center to ask,” he added.\nExperts also blame credit card companies for low enough call volume to run out of customer checks.\nIf your bank refused to refund you, you could have a new one, he said. That doesn’t mean that your credit report has been sorted out yet, since your name has not been on it. But that could be done by way of a fraud warning or by telling the company that your account was closed.\nWhile you have the right to sue for fraud, and if your bank told you you were covered, you could potentially file a claim in court, said Edward Gerson, a creditor attorney who advises people who have credit card questions about ATM fraud.\nAnd with consumer information inaccessible, they say they’re at an increased risk of falling victim to a bad call center, which they call “predictable.”\n“A lot of times, they’re seen to have an aura about them because they take credit card for legitimate purposes and repeat the fraud,” he said.\nThe fact that you have information about your account may prompt a call center to investigate, including questions about account settings. Any company should alert its customers immediately.\n']"

1248,"Coronavirus: How to work from home, the right way","['Autotimatic blunder it has been hard to watch at home, but a little help from some Google Docs couldn’t be better: How the heck did you shoot the Isavirus into your brain? (Haha, yeah, a recurrence. Do you think you do that?)\nThe Isavirus, a virus linked to global epidemics including Zika and STDs, is a type of the gastrointestinal virus found in more than 100 million people and germs in over 22 million. Once it’s dead, it can transmit it through coughing, sneezing, mouth dissection and vomiting to your body.\nAs it gets older, the human immune system detects and destroys the virus and stops the transmission and subsequent genetic modification of it in the body.\nSo how do you answer the phone? Do you either test your system, or do you just drop the phone down and it emits three-dots that causes huge unwanted flickering on your computer screen. “If the clock has slowed or the virus has grown or spread, it will send its new signal through your computer,” says the site, which discovered this error on March 18.\nThen from there, it will be sent through the gastrointestinal tract to the brain, said the site, which was also able to track from where the virus is known to have grown in living mice to a personal computer set it up.\nWhat’s really baffling is that the virus spreads only at the farthest point of the gastrointestinal tract, rather than the farthest point of the brain.\nIt’s important to understand how and why your computer screen is blowing up right now, said Webmaster of MedicalAware, an online health information provider. On the page, “How do you create a virus code that doesn’t break,” says the site. “So how do you always create a virus code that doesn’t break?”\nThen there’s what the site terms “myogized,” which is a virus that travels through other organs in the body, then spreads between different parts of the body, from the central nervous system down through the intestines to the liver, brain and even the gut. “Of course, I know it bugs you, but people aren’t really going to know it.”\nIt’s not true to assume that a person really didn’t receive the virus; the prognosis for how it is released is “very good,” the site said.\nOnce you’ve heard of it, find out if it is safe to go to work or not.\nAn Onramps Up\nFor now, recommend testing your computer for viruses to get rid of them. For most of us, a check on your computer is already quite smart.\nToday’s website addresses the use of “reportability protection,” which is a system meant to provide up-to-date information to users.\nOften, it means that it is best to head to the store and buy the right thing from the nearest vendor, what carries the most risk for viruses and where you see the issue in the store.\nHow to test your computer’s security\nIf you’re still living in a house, look at your utilities and personal records, likes and dislikes, and take it for a test before setting it up.\nOf course, if you’re on a company-owned laptop and have higher latencies of electricity, water, hot water, maybe it might not be the best time to rely on the Internet to protect your computer from the phone company.\nStart with a good look at passwords, bad passwords, Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS, and test for the best way to play games and school. “Let’s let the Internet do the talking,” says Webmaster of MedicalAware.\nThe Internet is full of interesting sites, some of which were part of CNN’s Sunday Beat list. And as with the Isavirus, you can’t see or respond to the symptoms you’re experiencing. If you are feeling any symptoms, such as headache, nausea or nausea, just ask the doctor.\nWhether or not there are definite, regular visits by you to your doctor, online health records and apps to track your symptoms are the best health-related plans for minimizing your risk of getting the virus.\n']"
1249,Why is the Palace of Westminster falling apart?,"['Here’s the shocking thing about this historic reopening: it is precisely the kind of thing Prince George or Princess Charlotte likes.\nLook, the Palace is still standing, and everyone still wants to tie it to them.\nBut it’s suddenly fall apart. It wasn’t a gift that Prince George ever wanted. It was something he named an elevator and that he acquired on his own. It was some sort of anchor that he loved: a good one.\nThe reason: what keeps this building alive, and who’s going to stop that? That prince, Prince Harry, who claims the Palace is his castle.\nBut he gives so much to the rest of us, we have to wrap them up with wrap coats that springboard away from them and light a fire under them. Why is this happening?\nOne reason: Harry has caught the Prince of Wales sleeping and it’s taking him away from the Queen.\nThe princess wasn’t home that night – and it could be that she didn’t get him until after he stepped out of the hotel.\nThat would be too much of a problem if it were Prince George, but it could be done.\nThe only thing that might give this thing some stability: the end of Queen Anne.\nThat day’s Royal Family anniversary was quickly undone by stories about Roman Catholics in the Palace wondering why the palace bothered to dress them up as a Roman invader, since that’s where their history was taken, as there’s no historical records proving this happened there.\nIt turns out the Palace isn’t among the private residences to be inspected by the Treasury. But so the department heads say they don’t believe anyone should have to be underground. Why? Why is the palace crumbling all these years later?\nThe Palace had an obligation to provide protection to the Queen for her entire life. The castle itself, which the Queen went to when she was a child, had some. But since that day all the castle had to be hers, except for Windsor Castle, where the Palace is constructed in accordance with the queen’s wishes.\nPerhaps it was obvious the Palace wasn’t among the private residences to be inspected by the Treasury. But as a government, we shouldn’t be so short on ideas.\nThe former governor of Britain, William Jewell, came to the palace as Prince George’s non-executive director. He later used to run the Army, and has become an MEP, and has been working there since his retirement from politics after a decade.\nThere was nothing anyone could do to rein in his former boss, George Saville.\nBut under Saville, Jewish leaders outside the palace complained about the desecration of the memorial on the grounds that the foundation to the memorial was very old and costly.\nVaunted Jews in the Palace complained that the memorial represented the colors of the Jewish people. But one of the most anti-Semitic outside Jews called the building “pretty sure” that it was done to commemorate the wars that broke out after World War II.\nSo Michael Strauss has spent a great deal of time plotting the way.\nHe’s looking for some kind of safe haven that would provide the Queen without the prince.\nSo he’s headed to the Palace.\nHe could do it for one place only.\nBut he would be OK with Princess Charlotte hanging in there like an extra, just a little more public.\nIf he does it in the Palace, it would take a lot of mystery. But he might as well do it.\n']"

How can you go out here, in church, and walk around all day, because you’re conservative?”\nTo his family and to the rest of the Tea Party faithful, Holdren was a blasphemer.\nThey thought he was crazy and they wished they had seen him again, but he did not.\n“So, to come in here and convert this former Christian preacher is about the apple of their eye,” said his friend Curt Smith, who interviewed Holdren for the book American Christians, a nearly-licensed Christian publication, last week.\n“He looked like an egomaniac,” said Smith. “You should see him as something else. It looks like he’s travelling around the country and being calloused by the truth, and there’s nothing in his face you can find in that.”\n“That’s what it looks like,” Holdren told Smith. “You get him ambushed and you have to tell him things that must be true.”\nThe book encourages the interpretation of the tea party as a conservative movement. It outlines a vicious, divinely inspired Catholic theology in which God thinks of America as a carnal realm whose wrath worshiped the Christian nation.\nHoldren said his source is David French, a white Christian who rose to fame in 1998 as a flash figure in the Christian church, now an outspoken atheist and rabbi.\nHe denied knowledge of Holdren’s anti-christian views but said Holdren did not have a military training.\nAccording to Smith, Holdren in the book began to think badly about the Tea Party when he felt a “trusting” father found evidence of opposition to Christianity in his country.\n“Even though he was Christian,” Smith said, “he still thought about that as serious involvement, and always believed about the political process of the country.”\nThere is no doubt that “American Christianity” is something Holdren believes. As former adviser to a Republican congressman in Texas, he served in the Cabinet of the Georgia Republican Ronald Reagan and later as a member of Congress from Louisiana.\nHe said he is not the first person to believe that Holdren is from America.\n“Like The Volker Family in the ’70s and early ’80s, I have always believed there are tyrants in American history,” Holdren told Smith. “But you go in and find a small people who are doing this or that because they’re willing to take a massive political cost.\n“I’ve always known there were atheists in America, so I was surprised, no?” Smith said. “‘What?’ ‘That’s right! They’re anti-God!’ ‘Well, some people are OK with it because they’re atheist.’ ‘Well, maybe it’s something you’re dealing with as an American and that’s fair!’ ‘The Bible is the Bible.’ ‘God is with us here!'”\n(CNN) — The “Pagan revival” in America, more than anything else, brings up the question of who should have the power to make America a more democratic place for all.\nHoldren gets it. It’s easy to see where he’s coming from.\n""]"
1251,How much of your body is your own?,"[""Advertisement\nLifestyle (from the vegetable icon, to the cat enthusiast, to expert) and trends/commentaries vary greatly from person to person. So, for a more detailed description of these subjects and themes, go to our Living Curiosities section.\nRiding the trail of viral copycat blogs, or the sleepwalking or obsession with strangers, brand in money and junk, today is fraught with something of existential complexity. There is the obvious jaw-dropping introspection about relationships, relationship problems, siblings, parenting (even leaving them in a compromising position), and even health/growth and security scares (“is there a helicopter dad?”). Not to mention the diversity of danger and consequences. And then there is the dizzying number of opinions and prognostications about who knows better, and why, other people. So, what good advice can you give?\nIf all that were a plodding buck away into 2011, it would have only been a blink to have been frank. The phrase 'we must laugh about this' has landed on its head. It’s a noun, verb and icon. Not since the 18th century have even a noun for comedy, pushing the boundaries, or humor, for that matter, seemed the distinctive part of the medium, characterized not by worry or brevity but by a sad, gentler-faced puzzlement.\nBut to us, humor is about more than laughter. It is powerful, dangerous, sexy, cool, cool and so much more than society gives it credit for. Looking back at the past decade's laughter will take a trip back to when the food was salty and the babes were late, but well-chosen. And while some of us are sick of the antimalism once seen and treasured, others come of age and appreciate the elegant characterisms of our laughter.\nLet’s be frank: I am not saying you must laugh because you are never disappointed, but because some really cool new media experiments like YouTube are genuinely scary and salacious in an attempt to cultivate a sense of humor. Now, in what could be the greatest volume of overpraise ever — back in 1964 and the start of Stephen King’s Dr. Phillips — sarcasm isn’t anything new. Life can be funny no matter what the subject. And speaking of sarcasm, how many comedians can say no when they are the whole giggling room where people watch, shake their heads, laugh and smile?\nNow, the fact that I just sent this letter to someone at work is no shock. I was 40ish and thought I was fifty-something, having just bought my first product for a woman who has been on maternity leave since the twenty-first birthday (given the age, it’s almost always a case of comparing health and grooming before the pregnancy), when the delivery came, and it was on with hours of pleasure.\nOver the years, I have grown to appreciate the hilariousness of it all, and the humor as good and glamorous as laugh at somebody else’s health scare. Why do men and women laugh when you’re married? Do they laugh when you get a lovely girlfriend? Do they laugh when you take care of them properly? They laugh when they make you feel old, and laugh when you cry when you’re trying not to cry, and they laugh when you’re anxious about all the different efforts you’ve made to make them feel old.\nI want to offer this provocative advice to those who have looked to it for advice, or advice they wish to do to themselves, but are choosing to avoid it. Here are four reasons I think, in no particular order, that you must give your all to your life and to work at it.\n""]"
1252,How do you keep a space station clean?,"['By Irma Cordova\nAzerbaijan, A.D., on Sunday gave a chance to build awareness of the importance of NASA\'s functioning space station. There was the launch, touching off the #C44200 and the launch of all three of NASA\'s newest research institutions, in the near future.\nTo keep NASA\'s 20-station laboratory clean and safe, the International Space Station needs advanced air circulation to determine whether a space station has been left over from the previous shuttle flight.\nMuch of the time, the space station\'s complex, fractured suitcases and electric boots help guarantee the safety of all its inhabitants. Without the pair, the atmosphere can deteriorate beyond its acceptable life.\nTherefore, astronauts must also save and keep clean space suits with a mechanical vacuum to avoid the effects of mold and other preventable issues.\n""Filling a space station properly is an important decision whether you need to have a space suit,"" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said during a NASA 2016 report on the space station.\nNASA also announced on Sunday that the space station would be refitted so it can handle new cargo: space station cargo.\nThe 200-station station already has 40 planned spaceships; one designed to carry four people and two payloads, and the next three more scheduled for delivery.\nEven before its systems work together, its astronauts face quality challenges while inside the station, such as flying with other scientists in orbit and working the electronics module.\nMany plans are being considered in the next Congress. NASA, the federal government and international space companies are working to minimize these challenges, and cooperate together.\nBelow is a look at the report by the International Space Station, pointing out that at the time of this report, three new space station systems were scheduled for launching in 2017, so there are about two dozen planned programs that could be approved. One includes new solid fuel modules for NASA, and another, three modules that could support multiple flights. These three new systems can be operational in 2021.\nToday\'s meeting at NASA\'s New Orleans headquarters provided a real-world look into how the space station operates on and around Earth. While the agency hopes that these new systems will help NASA\'s laboratories, preparations are being made for the expected launch of more modules and the capture of the robotic debris in 2018.\n']"
1253,The city where you pay a year's rent up front,"[""Here's a nice one for those looking to break into a professional office or after 25 years. Five hundred and forty dollars. That's what would be good for a hiring management firm that only has one senior management position.\nIt also helps that we do not have a free fast-food fast-food chain nor even a brick-and-mortar branch of a TV food shop.\nThe Economist recently ranked cities with the highest rates of owner-occupancy -- but in some cities, a class action lawsuit could take out these scores, and many have proposed to the police who do their jobs to hold them accountable for it.\nOf course, it's not just your rent the head of your company gets to live in, it's your company's senior management. The society of professionals has altered for decades. There were .8 names in the mayor's office of every mayor in the nation in 2011.\nFast-food companies now have a market share, and corporations that write about them. The Economist looked at what businesses in the world had in common with employees -- 100,000 of them.\nIt found that the number of companies with at least 100 employees increased fivefold from 1980 to 2014.\nIn the boardroom, many executives skip class, bury their heads in the sand, trust their underlings, settle out of state, promise to fix any problems and nobody cares.\nThat change happened when we started moving into the office culture of 70s America. It's analogous to working in the workplace to do it in bed. We now have, because part of our responsibility is to someone else.\nLike all the good things about work, modernity is a dangerous game for the survival of a small business -- one that can sometimes make it hard to find long-term success.\nHowever, the most unhealthy way to do business is to learn to take care of your employees. If you're working too much, you risk upsetting the employees, in turn causing emotional burnout and cold feet.\nHealing in your workplace can be a very difficult enterprise to find. Most of us want to work for a great employer, where we can relax and enjoy the company, but we also want to share the burden -- for others to enjoy it too.\nEven in the good old days, there was an implicit invitation to make repairs and often failed repairs in your agency. You had to trust that someone was really looking to do something for you -- rather than merely making repairs, you would just do them, on your own.\nWith the pace of technology, more and more people are looking to work for their companies. Today, a brand-new online tool leads to almost unprecedented research that explains how businesses are changing. Social and labor engineers (more people than ever are employed in a business) think about a startup when social applications get developed.\nIt's easy to understand why businesses are getting into this new field: increasing its reach and the ease of doing business, often leading to higher profits. When it comes to the host city -- it's the place you go and not the crummy state of your business -- the good old days are over.\n""]"

1255,Learn how the BBC is working to strengthen trust and transparency in online news,"['This story was adapted from an NPR piece that was provided to CNN by the BBC.\n[This article has been changed to highlight the BBC working with the Open Society Foundation to build a better trust and transparency in online news.]\nSEATTLE, Wash. (CN) — The press outlet described the BBC as “100 percent open for business” Friday, but an organization critical of the way the BBC distributes its material did not bother to note that a reporter reported it was one.\nThe BBC executive led an executive committee meeting aimed at improving the availability of text and video content on its website, according to a story by Jeffrey Elligh, the executive director of the BBC Trust, published in the journal All Things Digital. The BBC executive committee took up the issue of access to information online on a wide scale.\n“Our job is to educate the public on the latest news and the potential dangers of the current unregulated and insecure environments,” the executive committee report read. “To do this we are aware of the growing threat to our establishment.”\nThrough its public relations agency, communications, the BBC seeks to place users into at least equal peer pressure, Elligh said.\n“We are constantly studying the danger of Internet connectivity and the online environment that it represents,” he said. “As far as what is engaging a reader online, the key factor is that what is engaging a reader online is engaging their online lives.”\nThe BBC’s decision to rely on Twitter seemed to be based on, Elligh said, an analysis of a recent study by Trust magazine that found that, on average, an average citizen who used the microblogging service received 23 tweets a day and a retweet every 30 minutes. The BBC found that 125 fewer tweets per day than the audience CNN was based on.\n“It is crucial for media organizations and independent sources of information to develop how they disseminate their content to a public that is more inclusive and welcoming to all,” the BBC statement said.\nThe company, however, did not mention the company in its comments.\n']"
