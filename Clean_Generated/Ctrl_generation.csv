2,China wants to take a victory lap over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak,"[""News China wants to take a victory lap over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak in Hong Kong. \n The virus has killed at least 21 people and infected more than 1,000 since it was first detected there last month. It is believed that most have been Chinese citizens who had traveled abroad for treatment or were working as doctors there. But health officials say they are still investigating whether anyone else may be infected. A total ban on travel from this country remains until further notice. [Page A8.] In addition today, China's Ministry Of Health said tests showed evidence suggesting an unusual strain called SARS could spread through humans if not properly treated. [Excerpts, Page B6.] Dr. Wu Jianmin, director general with Guangdong Province, which includes Guangzhou, told reporters today he expected ''a significant outbreak'' within days. He added later by telephone that, ''We're prepared should something happen.'' At issue here will likely turn out either one way -- another case confirms what many suspect but no conclusive proof supports it. Either way, Beijing would probably try hard just now before rushing into any new action. And while some experts believe such action might delay even worse problems, others think it's better late rather then never. Even so, both sides seem intent upon taking advantage now. With so much attention focused elsewhere, few outside Asia know about this. This makes Beijing's decision all too predictable. If you want your own version read this:.

3,Coronavirus disinformation creates challenges for China's government,"[""News Coronavirus disinformation creates challenges for China's government \n BEIJING – The Chinese government's efforts to contain a deadly new virus that has killed more than 100 people in recent months have been hampered by an unusually high number of false reports about the virus, which is known as SARS. But officials say they are trying hard not only with their own warnings but also through public relations and education campaigns aimed at discouraging panic among residents -- especially those who work or study abroad from getting infected. In addition, health authorities say, many doctors report patients suffering symptoms consistent with, if not, identical to, signs found on other patients. That suggests there may be some overlap between cases reported here last week and, perhaps, others elsewhere around China. And it raises questions over whether China will face another outbreak like its previous one, when nearly 200 were infected before being isolated this year. ''We cannot afford any repeat performance,'' said Dr. Jiang Yue, deputy director general medical affairs bureau under Health Ministry. He spoke after meeting Monday morning President Hu Jintao. ''We're doing everything we can so no one gets infected.'' Mr. Hu, speaking during his annual news conference, called such outbreaks 'a major threat' because most victims recover without complications. [New York Times, 11/21/2001] Yet even though he acknowledged these risks, Beijing continues press releases warning citizens against traveling overseas while waiting out potential cases. Officials note that, despite widespread misreporting, few foreigners get sick here. A survey released earlier today showed fewer foreign tourists visiting Shanghai since Sept. 11. Despite this, travel agencies continue offering discounts ranging up 40 percent off regular prices. Some travelers stay away until Dec. 31.

4,China coronavirus: Eating wild animals made illegal but ending the trade won't be easy,"[""News China coronavirus: Eating wild animals made illegal but ending the trade won't be easy. \n A new study says that while there are no direct links between eating meat and contracting SARS, it is possible to get infected by consuming contaminated meat. The researchers say they have found evidence of a link with consumption from pigs in China. But this could not explain why people who had eaten pork were more likely than others -- including those without symptoms or even healthy eaters like me - caught it. So we may need further research on how much exposure each person has been exposed to. In any case, it's important for consumers here at home as well if they're going out into public places where raw meats might come in. We should also consider whether our own food supply would contain enough bacteria resistant to, say, E. coli O157:H7 so someone can eat something that's potentially dangerous. If not, then perhaps you shouldn't go out. And I hope everyone else does. I'm sure many other Americans feel exactly same way. You don't want your health compromised. That's what we're all trying hard for. It's just unfortunate some folks will try anything over here. Or maybe not. It doesn't matter. We're still doing everything right here, folks.

5,China's economy could shrink for the first time in decades because of the coronavirus,"[""News China's economy could shrink for the first time in decades because of the coronavirus and other respiratory infections, a leading Chinese official said today. \n The official, Wang Qishan, director general at an agency that oversees economic policy, told reporters here today after meeting with officials from 10 countries to discuss ways they can help China deal more effectively against SARS. He also urged them not only ''fight but win.'' [Page A6.] ''We have no choice now,'' Mr. Wang, who is based here, said. In addition he said, his country would seek new financing through international organizations like World Bank or Asian Development Bank. [Excerpts, Page B8.] But while many nations are rushing into action, there has been little coordination among them. And even if some governments do begin coordinating their efforts, it will be difficult -- especially since most people infected by this virus live outside China, where health care systems often lack adequate resources. Most experts agree on one thing: It may take years before any effective response occurs. So far, about 10,000 cases worldwide appear likely each year, according Dr. Anthony Fauci, head scientist emeritus atÂ the\xa0National Institute of\xa0Allergy andImmunology. About half were reported last year alone. If all those deaths occurred within six months, as was expected, then global death toll might reach 200,000. That number includes 220,000 deaths, including 51,000 fatalities, attributed directly to, say, malaria, which kills up to\xa0 1 million children every year.

6,China and Japan's budding relationship in the time of coronavirus,"[""News China and Japan's budding relationship in the time of coronavirus. \n The virus has been linked to a series deaths from pneumonia since last year but no cases have yet shown up outside Asia or even within China. It is thought that it could be spread by people who come into contact with infected animals such as monkeys at zoos around Asia. But experts say they are still trying determine how far this disease can spread. They said there was little evidence so far, however, suggesting any link between humans being bitten while on holiday abroad and, say, an outbreak here. And many tourists visiting Hong Kong were not infected. A Chinese tourist died after returning home earlier than expected. In Japan, where two Japanese men fell ill shortly before Christmas, authorities ordered all visitors staying over for Christmas holidays away until further notice. Some hotels also closed their doors early because guests had already left. There appeared today only one case among those infected, which occurred when someone returned late Saturday night -- about eight hours later - bringing back his own travel bag. He did not, though, show symptoms himself. Authorities believe he contracted SARS during overseas travel. At least three other travelers came down sick there. One man died, another recovered fully, according Tokyo hospitals. All five patients worked overseas, including four Americans working abroad. Another American woman got sick. Officials don't know if she caught it. Japan will test more hotel rooms next week ahead of, possibly, additional cases. Most foreign passengers arriving here stay overnight anyway, officials said. ''We do everything we can,'' Yoshiaki Okamoto, head doctor general told reporters. ''We're doing our best.'' Health Minister Yukio Edano Onaga visited Shanghai today.

It was not immediately clear if this would affect food safety or trade between countries. But it could be bad news as far afield as, say, Europe. A second virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, had also emerged from animal sources before being identified by scientists last year. That virus, known formally only under its French name, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), can cause pneumonia but does not, so far, appear capable yet again causing human deaths. In fact, there are no confirmed cases anywhere outside China. And while some experts believe such viruses may still pose risks when they make their way into humans, others say it\'s unlikely because most humans don\'t get sick with them. (See pictures inside Beijing\'s Olympic stadium.) ) For now, however, officials seem content just letting things run out naturally. ""We will continue monitoring all these viruses,"" said Zhang Hui, director general (health), National Health Commission. ""And we hope our efforts won\'t harm any other people."" He added that, unlike previous epidemics, ""we do know what kind [of disease] each one is. We already knew about MERS (Middle East Aviritis). Now we\'re seeing H7N9 [Middle Eastern Influenza].

Two years later, another major outbreak, this time among pigs on farms near Shanghai, claimed nearly 10,000 lives. In all, about half as many have been confirmed to be dead since then. But it has taken China until recently for officials here even acknowledge there are any swine flu cases here.

13,The 30 most troubling lines from Donald Trump's latest news conference on coronavirus,"['News The 30 most troubling lines from Donald Trump\'s latest news conference on coronavirus \n (CNN) -- On Tuesday, the World Health Organization declared that it has ""sufficient information"" to declare a global public health emergency over an outbreak of highly pathogenic bird flu. And yet, as I write this, more than two months after this announcement was made, there is still no official word about whether or not we should all be worried and how widespread it\'s spreading. In fact, WHO officials have been so tight-lipped in their response that, according one report, they are now considering changing WHO\'s name back into its original acronym, ""Ebola."" As if that\'s even possible. But here\'s what you need know right now: If you\'re sick with EBOLA, don\'t panic. It\'s unlikely you\'ll get it. It may take several weeks for symptoms like fever and/or vomiting (or both) before your body starts producing antibodies against it, but chances are, once those begin appearing, they\'re going away. Your immune system will fight off any virus trying desperately (and vainly) make contact through you. You can rest assured knowing that. But, at least until then, keep yourself safe by getting vaccinated and, especially, washing hands thoroughly when traveling outside areas where Ebola might spread. And, please, stop sneezing — which could spread airborne droplets containing viruses such as, yes, avian influenza virus. (Yes, I\'m talking here specifically here, because I\'ve seen too many people sneeze without thinking twice... ) When you\'ve done everything else necessary (including staying home during flu season, avoiding travel abroad, wearing long sleeves covering up sleeves, etc.) then go out somewhere warm, preferably outside, away from, say, New York City (where there\'s lots of) or, better still, Los Angeles. There, just north central California Avenue, near downtown L.A. Or, best bet, though my friend who lives there, says he would be: ""I think we\'re having some kind of, like, \'...\'"" He stops short answer is, ""and maybe San Francisco Bay Area residents were probably aren\'t necessarily use it."" So, while also means he\'s got something else. So let\'s say this: ""We believe these days since we\'ve had enough information about, including what\'s happening around us all.

17,New arts district aims to brighten Chennai community's dark reputation,"[""News New arts district aims to brighten Chennai community's dark reputation \n NEW DELHI -- The new Art Deco building in the heart of India's capital is a gleaming white beacon that will be visible from miles around. But its most striking feature may not even have been designed by an architect. It was built with money donated anonymously and without government permission. And it has become one more symbol for what many Indians say are their country's ugly underbelly. A few years ago, this area had no art galleries or museums. Now there are. In recent years, artists like Anoushka Shankar, who won international acclaim as part owner at Tate Modern, opened galleries. Last year, another Indian artist, Manish Malhotra, created his first solo show here. More recently, two young British artists, David Hockney (who lives here) and, less well, Damien Hirst, moved in. There were also several prominent American artists. Most important, though, these days there's something else. An artist named Shweta Shetty started her own gallery here last year. She calls herself ''the world's only female contemporary artist.'' Her work consists mostly paintings made on canvas, but she does some sculpture too. As well as, say, creating ''works inspired by'' graffiti art. It's all very cool. What else do you expect when you're talking about India today? For those reasons, I went looking today. And, boy, did my eyes light up. Here they were, just around corner No. 1. These pictures look so good. They make me want more. So much more, really, than anything I've seen before. This isn't necessarily because it's new. If anything, I'm surprised how good things can be. There's nothing bad here, either. You see them all. People don't go up close up, whereas everything down below. They're everywhere. That's why people come out there. Not everybody knows what's happening now. All right, that's happening. That doesn't mean something. Maybe we haven't done right. Even if they're doing it. We need that. What's going on. So, now we're trying hard work. Some day after night time. When they've got started.

So here’s what’s going on. First, let’s talk briefly about…. Oh, wait. That’s not quite right. Let’s start talking just now. OK, so we’re getting into something called “fiscal cliff.” Here’s why. Last week, President Obama proposed raising taxes across all income levels except those making $250,000 per year. He said he’d do it gradually, over 10 years. Now, that’s fine. It would be nice if, instead of, say, cutting Medicare spending right away, we’d cut Social Security too. That way, everybody could benefit. But, no, actually, it’s better to, well, raise tax rates only gradually. Because then lower them later. It’s like that. So, instead, because people who wants higher taxes? Anyway, anyway, right? Right. OK. Okay. Now he’s got it. To make sure sounds good. What does not. How did he? His proposal was actually makes no one thing was, okay, since there’s been reduced taxes. In fact, though, which is, first rate. This isn’t it? Just look at, say so. For example, Obama’s plan will cost him less than any way down there were much less. Tax reform means what? Taxing away most Americans pay more, they paid for. Why? Why should be. They may be, why didn’t go up. There are, however, went down. It's true. There’s more. As far too much. And, according to. A little bit higher. What’s that? Not so, they’re paying less, yet even though many things through progressive rate cuts. These two years ago, while giving away. More expensive tax. At least part two, where Democrats think it's easy enough money goes up, especially big difference. One reason why, then, Mr. Sarkozy, you’re gonna pay. Their own biggest problem. Is still must go.

26,Why the impact of coronavirus could be particularly bad on college campuses,"[""News Why the impact of coronavirus could be particularly bad on college campuses is unclear, but it has been linked to a number health problems in people who have had contact with infected animals, including those that may carry SARS or other viruses. \n In addition, Dr. Frieden said, there are concerns about how quickly an infection can spread from person A through animal reservoirs and whether students might not get enough time between exposure before becoming ill. The virus was first found among camels at Saudi Arabian farms last year, he said. It then appeared as far away -- perhaps across oceans by way of, say, Hong Kong or, perhaps, New York City - where several cases were reported this year. There also appears little reason for concern because most patients recover quickly, said Peter Hotez, director general emeritus medical officer responsible for, respectively, public health, epidemiology & surveillance division (epidemiology) within WHO. ''We don't know if it's going over long distances,'' Mr. Hoft told reporters. ''We're still looking into that.'' He added later: 'It's possible we haven't seen all these cases.' But even though only one case so far, involving two university students, seems likely right now, WHO officials say they will continue monitoring both countries closely. They plan another meeting next month when experts discuss what should happen next. And while some scientists believe such viruses do cause more serious illness than previously thought, others disagree. One expert says his own research shows no evidence linking any particular strain like MERS-CoV directly to, you know, swine flu, which killed thousands around Christmas 2001. Other researchers think there's plenty here too. For example, here's why many universities ban their animals during flu season: Because influenza kills up until symptoms appear after getting sick means dead ones first. So what's happening now would seem unlikely. What does kill them first? How much less important? Is H1N1 virus, that's all. Influenza strains usually die off humans make good medicine work better since its effects become worse Virus itself makes us well just isn't always gets stronger later on. Some studies show strong yet vaccine works best known H5None. What's really doesn't mean higher doses often turn out there. This year's pandemic vaccines aren't very hard To help stop it. As soon follow up. Why? Just look similar viruses, especially high risk factors Are few years ago got low numbers go down. Could possibly due too big influenza. It's easy kill. There's something else Ebola virus's main problem When someone come back again same disease I am sure is. After all, thanks maybe Ebolsters tend to.

27,Diplomat at the UN tests positive for coronavirus,"[""News Diplomat at the UN tests positive for coronavirus \n A diplomat from a country that has been hit by an outbreak of SARS was tested yesterday in New York and found to have antibodies against one strain -- but not another one. The diplomat, who is also infected with Ebola, had no symptoms when he returned home after being admitted on Sept. 19. He will be monitored closely over coming days before returning home. But it appears unlikely his condition would prompt him or anyone else here immediately into quarantine. Instead, officials are considering whether they should allow people like him, whose exposure could pose risks if caught while traveling outside their countries, back onto American soil. If so, many experts say this approach might prove more effective than isolating them here. ''If you isolate them, you're going down two paths,'' said Dr. Peter Piot, director general emeritus de la World Health Organization. ''You're either giving up your rights as citizens here, which I think we shouldn't do, because then you've just created kind of, what amounts to, second-class citizens.'' In other words, treating patients without first making sure they're safe enough elsewhere may create new problems later. And it's unclear how long such measures can last. There were already signs last week that, even though some countries seemed ready now only weeks ago under pressure about possible contagion, others did not. On Monday, France announced plans today (nyti.ms/1s2y4u) aimed specifically at, among others, China. It called upon China 'to take all necessary measures' so its health authorities do everything needed both domestically and, potentially, abroad. That means stopping travelers arriving through air travel within China, Hong Kong until further afield, since mid-October, according China's Ministry spokesman said. Meanwhile, Britain urged Britons flying out there, saying there must return home, warning those visiting London residents go straight there. Officials insist there's nothing short notice. As news emerged earlier Monday morning reports surfaced suggesting British Airways passengers leaving Heathrow Airport reported flights canceled flights, including connecting London, where several times between Aug. 22.

Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP Photo / Getty Images. The World Health Organisation has warned that it is not yet clear how SARS virus spreads among humans. But what does seem certain to health experts and governments worldwide are that, if left unchecked, this outbreak could be far more devastating than any previous outbreak. In recent years, many countries have taken steps such as introducing screening for people who might contract or spread it, but they may now need more. There will also probably come time when some new vaccine becomes available – something which would help contain future outbreaks. This week, WHO said there was no reason why we should wait until then. It urged all nations with cases reported since March 1st 2009 (defined by WHO’s definition here) ""to take immediate measures against further transmission through vaccination.""

In fact, some analysts say this may actually make things worse because bond buyers might find themselves stuck holding more worthless paper.

He added, however, that, if it did happen, he would expect some sort or combination -- including people with flu-like symptoms and others whose immune systems had failed them because they got sick during SARS outbreaks elsewhere. But there was no evidence so far suggesting such complications, according his team. And while many scientists are still trying hard on their own theories explaining why humans can get infected by viruses other than influenza, none have yet come up against anything resembling what happened here. Even so, public health experts say it's clear we need better ways both now and, more important, later on. In particular, doctors should keep patients informed when someone has become ill after getting infected. They also must take steps immediately afterward whenever possible even though infections might seem mild enough just now. If you do catch it, make sure your doctor knows how serious you're feeling. This means asking questions like, Are my fever levels high now? Is I having trouble breathing? Do any medicines help me? What else could cause me these symptoms? Finally, don't wait until you've gotten better. It may turn out worse rather quickly. It's important right away now, but once infection sets in, say, two weeks later. That way, too, since most likely will give us time enough. So let's start thinking ahead now! You won't hurt you. Think ahead. That's where we're going. You're probably right. We can't wait. Then we'll know what's coming next week. We'll know. They'll tell us. When they're not. Now there's nothing else. Maybe one week away. Let's think fast. One thing is, we've known it..

39,'Bloodshot' brings Vin Diesel back to life in a superhero-like origin story,"[""News 'Bloodshot' brings Vin Diesel back to life in a superhero-like origin story that has been the subject of much speculation since it was announced last month. \n The film, which stars Mr. Diesel, is scheduled for release on May 20, and will be followed by ''Pitch Black,'' another superhero film from Warner Brothers with Dwayne Johnson as an ex-convict who becomes involved romantically while trying not only survive but also keep his girlfriend alive. It opens July 18. A third movie, directed again this time around at Paramount Pictures -- one about two brothers fighting crime together after they are released early parole - may follow soon. And there could even come more sequels or spinoffs. In addition to, say, John Woo, whose action films include several starring Jackie Chan, now directing three movies based upon characters created during World War II. These projects would add up quickly if all were released. But some analysts say such plans might take years longer than expected, because studios have had trouble finding enough new material. Even so, these directors said their goal remained simple: make good movies. They pointed out that, unlike most Hollywood directors, many Asian filmmakers did well when adapting foreign scripts into American films. One reason why so few successful adaptations came across Hollywood's radar screens: Many Americans simply don't, culturally, identify themselves strongly enough. As such, those producers often turn instead toward European directors. That means less money and, often, fewer opportunities overseas. This year, according toBoxOfficeMojo, domestic box office revenue fell 11 percent compared withits peak year four decades ago. Still, box-office receipts still increased 22 percent, despite inflation over all. At least until 2004. So far, though, it's hard luck alone can save Hollywood. After all, including success stories.

Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe » TL;DR The school is part of, but not directly connected to, an effort to improve relations between immigrant children from Mexico who attend public schools elsewhere around town and, especially, those whose families are still living there. To be sure, there have been some positive changes. For example, parents say their children's behavior has improved since they were moved into new classrooms last year. But many others here complain that tensions remain high because immigrants do more than just live among one another. They also send money back home for food or other needs. And while most residents agree it would help if all students attended school, few want it. In fact, only about half do. At P.S. 5, which opened this year, nearly 50 percent do, according city data. About 30 percent, however, drop out before graduation. That means fewer opportunities open up when kids leave school. ''The quality isn't as good here,'' said José Rivera, principal here. ''Kids don't come back.'' He added that, despite its name, he does try hard enough -- though sometimes too hard. Some teachers feel pressure by parents, too. When Mr. Rivera was teaching English two years ago, his first class had 20 students. Now it's down almost half. His second grade classes now average 25 students, compared with, say, 15 three decades ago. Even so, he's trying harder now.

41,'A Quiet Place II' release delayed by coronavirus,"[""News 'A Quiet Place II' release delayed by coronavirus \n The film adaptation of the best-selling novel ''Amityville: A Novel'' was pushed back from its May 25 date to June 7, because it is believed that a new case has been confirmed in New York City, health officials said yesterday. But they added there were no immediate plans for an evacuation. ''We are not going anywhere until we have some information on this,'' Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, director and chief executive officer at Bellevue Hospital Center, said. She declined further comment. In addition she said, as recently reported here, two other patients who had come into contact with Mr. Kaczynski -- his brother David J. Lebovitz Jr., 32, also known under different names but now charged criminally after being found guilty last month along side him - tested positive this week too. Both men worked closely together during their time working together. They lived near each other. One died shortly before he fell ill. Another man whose name did appear briefly among those infected appears healthy enough now. Officials say both remain hospitalized while tests continue there. All three cases involved people living close together, including one woman who, like Ms. Foster, lives next door or within walking distance of, if not, directly in, her brother's apartment. Investigators believe all four victims may be related. There will likely never again be, doctors say, any reason why anyone would want anything more than privacy when dealing publicly about what happened inside such intimate quarters. And so far away that, even now, investigators cannot rule out whether someone else might share something similar information. That remains highly unlikely. It could happen again. If so, however, many questions remain. For example, how much larger numbers can mean little without knowing exactly where anthrax spores don't. Is it? What kind ofter make you can't grow up close, yet? How long term used often means it's possible only once again, making sure enough, especially since Sept. 11 years ago.

A spokesman for ABC said it had no immediate comment. Fox has not yet announced whether or when any of “The Simpsons” episodes are affected. In addition, CBS canceled an episode on Friday that featured Mr. MacFarlane, who plays Dr. Frasier Crane. He is scheduled to appear at Comic-Con next week with his new series, which he created alongside David E. Kelley, about three friends living together as roommates but still managing their careers. It stars Kelsey Grammer (“Cheers”) opposite Ms. Fey. (Both shows were produced by 20th Century Fox.) At Comic-Con, several other television series have been canceled. But there may be more cancellations ahead because some producers say they cannot afford another round without being able use actors from one show against another. For example, last week, two weeks before shooting began again, HBO pulled out all stops trying unsuccessfully — so far unsuccesfully -- try get Stephen Colbert back into prime time. Last night, Showtime also called off plans earlier than expected while Warner Brothers Entertainment put up signs warning fans away until further notice. And CBS, too, suspended production, citing fears related to, among others, swine flu. So far, only four episodes, including those starring Tom Selleck, remain scheduled. Some network executives worry that, if enough people cancel shows, fewer advertisers would come calling. That could mean less money available each week. Another factor keeping many networks away: They often shoot most likely include time slots during sweeps season. With few viewers tend toward Halloween, Halloween weekend. Many stations do air reruns instead of, say, especially since Sept. 11. There won’t start Oct. 31.

52,Justin Timberlake and Anderson .Paak duet on funky 'Don't Slack',"[""News Justin Timberlake and Anderson .Paak duet on funky 'Don't Slack' \n The first time I saw the video for ''Don't Slack, Won't Break,'' it was in a dark room at Madison Square Garden with my friend Jeff Goldblum. He had been watching me watch Britney Spears videos all night. We were both mesmerized by her dance moves. But as soon he turned to me, Mr. Goldberg said, ''You know, you look like you're having fun.'' And then we watched it. It wasn't just that she looked good. She danced so well. Her body language seemed effortless. When Ms. Spears's dancers did their moves -- they are professional dancers, not amateurs who have never done anything before this night or any other night, but merely students of choreography from ballet schools around New York City whom no one else seems able even remotely close to, let alone imitate properly enough without looking amateurish themselves (and there is nothing amateur about them either) - well, those guys really got into it, too. They didn't seem self-conscious because they're professionals. They're trying hard. That's what makes dancing fun. It's also why it's hard work when someone does something wrong. You don't want people thinking your job isn't worth doing. So if you've ever seen an audience reacting badly after seeing some bad dancing, that's how most audiences reacted last night: disbelieving, baffled. At least half our crowd left early. One woman came back 20 minutes later saying, '' 'I can't believe this. This girl can dance.' She's amazing!''. Another man said later, his wife asked him where he'd heard Britney's song from. His response was, 'Oh, I've only know that.' Then another couple more than I'd heard, which sounded pretty good until later. There must be many years ago. A lot better dancers. After that, while sitting here today. In between them. As much too much. These days since then. My favorite songs played out there, still do. Now I'm going on. Even though we're doing things up.

53,'The View' and more shows suspend studio audiences over coronavirus,"[""News 'The View' and more shows suspend studio audiences over coronavirus fears \n The outbreak of a deadly virus that has killed at least 40 people in the Middle East is forcing many television networks to temporarily halt their live broadcasts for fear they will be overrun with viewers who are worried about spreading infection. NBC's ''Today'' show suspended its broadcast on Friday after it was inundated by calls from anxious viewers. ABC's ''Good Morning America'', which had been scheduled as an hour earlier, also canceled plans this week because so much time remained before another wave could arrive. CBS said Thursday morning that, while no decision would have yet made regarding whether or not any programs were canceled, there might well come some kind word soon. NBC announced yesterday evening -- just hours away - what appeared likely enough when news broke last night that: A man infected during his trip abroad may develop SARS, but he does not, unlike other recent cases, seem contagious. That means all three major networks, ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox News, CNN and, most important, CW, should postpone coverage until further notice. And if you want your local station coverage, here's where you'll find it: All stations owned by, affiliated with, operated under license from, and/or controlled directly by/through Sinclair Broadcast Group, including WJLA (Channel 7) here. On Thursday, however, ABC executives confirmed reports saying only one affiliate planned on-air coverage. So far, none have. Here's how each network handled similar situations two years ago: In 2003, WABC-TV (channel 9) pre-empted several weeks worth hundreds (maybe thousands) of, well, perhaps tens (if even hundreds, depending upon one's point system) above ) due to, among others, according to... what? To protect against possible contagion fears. But it's hard facts like this: When I don't know exactly why do we haven't seen anything yet.

54,'The Hunt' leverages the partisan divide as a hook to sell an exploitation throwback,"[""News 'The Hunt' leverages the partisan divide as a hook to sell an exploitation throwback that is more than just another political thriller. The movie has been criticized for its graphic violence and explicit sexual content. \n ''Hunt For Red October'' was directed by Michael Bay, who made his name with films like ''Terror.'' Mr. Bay also wrote this summer's hit film of Tom Clancy's best-selling novel, which starred Kevin Costner in one role. In both films, he uses military hardware -- including helicopters used during World War II battles on Iwo Jima or B-52 bombers from Vietnam flying over Moscow at night after nuclear strikes had destroyed cities there earlier - but they are not really about combat. They are, rather, vehicles through which, under cover of, say, rescuing hostages, American soldiers can take out their enemies. This time, however, it seems clear what audiences will see: plenty if you want it. And that's exactly what's going on. A lot more. As much action comes off screen here (explosions, firefights, car chases) without any real sense behind them (the script doesn't even bother trying hard enough either) so does some pretty good acting. But it's all done mostly off-screen, except when someone gets shot. Even then, there's no indication why they're being shot, only vague hints dropped along plot lines intended primarily (and sadly) because we can't see them. It's almost impossible now days (at least I haven't seen it) ever again seeing anything resembling authenticity onscreen again. If you're looking forward instead toward something new (a war movie, perhaps) then maybe you'll find yourself entertained. Otherwise, stay away. You won't miss much. Or better things.

But when none did, there was no show. Instead, comedian Jon Stewart, dressed like Santa Claus, gave his usual monologue introducing \'\'Saturday Night Live\'\' sketches he had written over several months while waiting patiently backstage after taping last week\'s episode (which aired Tuesday night). Then came another monologue, which included jokes such as, \'\' \'I can\'t believe I just got up here today,\' said Stewart. \'I\'m not supposed to.\' "" (\'\') At least two other people were laughing too, including Tina Fey, whose new book deal comes out, she wrote based upon her experiences working alongside Ms. Fey (who plays herself onstage), though she\'s never actually did play herself.

60,"What's streaming on Netflix, Hulu and Amazon in March","[""News What's streaming on Netflix, Hulu and Amazon in March will be available for purchase by the end of April. \n The new season begins with ''American Horror Story: Freak Show,'' a horror anthology series that stars Kathy Bates as an actress who becomes obsessed after being attacked while filming her latest movie. It is produced at FX Networks (run jointly from New York City -- where it was created last year but now owned entirely separately ) under its original name, FX. Its first episode has been watched more than 14 million times since debuting two weeks ago. On Tuesday, another installment debuts called ''The Following.'' A third series, based loosely around Stephen King's novel about three young people drawn into supernatural events, premieres next month. All four are set to begin their runs this fall. And there have already rumors circulating among fans suggesting other shows might follow. Some even say they expect one or several episodes each week devoted exclusively to, say, vampires or, better yet, zombies. In fact, some think such stories could become so popular that, if enough viewers tune in, television networks may start charging subscribers extra fees just because they've got too many subscribers. As Mr. Lombardo puts it, it's all part of, well, television. He said he thought cable companies would eventually catch up when most customers were paying $10 per month instead $15. But there's still plenty left over before then. By then, perhaps HBO can find something else worth watching. For now, though, you should probably watch these shows. They won't let up. You can't go wrong. Or maybe not. Just don't tell anyone. It's not your business. --Michael Cieply (NYT) www.michamilton.com. com /pb/ yahoo.com. Copyright 2007 Viacom Inc.

62,'The Banker' yields a modest return on Apple's first bite at movies,"[""News 'The Banker' yields a modest return on Apple's first bite at movies and television programming. \n The big question is whether the company can keep up with its own hype. Apple has already made some impressive strides in creating an entertainment industry that includes iTunes, iPod, iPhone and, most recently, iPod Touch. But it still lags behind rivals like Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN - news -- people ) which sells music for $9.99 or less per download. And even though iTunes sales are growing fast, they have yet to match those of rival services such as Microsoft's Windows Media Player software. Last week, Microsoft announced plans this week tosell video players through retail stores by year's end. In addition, Disney expects revenue from DVD rentals will grow about 20 percent annually over three years. That means more money could be spent developing new content than ever before. If all goes well, though, analysts say Disney's movie business may become one reason why investors should buy shares today. ''It's not just going into movies,'' says Robert Iger, chairman emeritus Walt Disney. ''We're looking forward to, you know, doing other things besides film.'' Indeed, Mr. Iger recently said he was optimistic his company's future would include television. Disney, whose stock closed yesterday above $60, did well last year thanks largely because consumers were eager enough after years without film releases (aside from, perhaps, Star Wars) but unwilling (or unable) spend much time watching TV. This year, however, there seems little doubt that, once again, Hollywood studios won't stop making movies. Even if their profits fall short next year. Shares rose $1.8125, closing Friday morning before settling back down $2.125. On Monday, when Wall Street had been expecting earnings estimates ranging between $1.50 billion dollars earned so far below expectations. As expected, many analysts' expectations call estimates. For now, it's hard data suggest there's no matter what percentage points seem optimistic. Still, given how long term expectations: It's likely they'll get there. Stocks & P/E minus Earnings estimate coming out 12/31/31 1/14/20/21, ahead ratio = 1.56 vs. expected EPS /2.35 11/32 ratio. A very high end 10/32, while analyst price target range range.

63,"Al Pacino hunts Nazis in 'Hunters,' a series whose premise tops its execution","[""News Al Pacino hunts Nazis in 'Hunters,' a series whose premise tops its execution \n The film “Hunters”is the latest entry from director Ron Howard, and it features one of his most memorable performances to date. In this tale about an American hunter who goes after Nazi war criminals, he plays Adolf Hitler himself, with some help by Tom Hanks. It’s not just that Mr. Howard has made another great movie — he’s done so many good ones over these years it’s hard for him even remember them all. He makes you believe every word you’re saying as if you’ve known each character all your life. And when Hanks comes on screen, well, let’s face it, there’s no way anyone could be more perfect than him. But that’s only part – or maybe half - why we love it. We also get two other things out there along side it: A terrific script (by Ben Affleck) and, yes, plenty of, um, hunts. (Yes, they do exist.) It may seem like overkill, but they’re what make movies great. They are action movies, sure, but, at their core, hunting stories have always been thrillers. You want action, go watch “The Fast & Furious” series. Or better yet, see how far back James Bond films go. If you’d rather take time away from, say, reading books, then check into any number (or all) outdoor adventure camps. There’s nothing wrong being outside, especially during spring break, which means lots (and lots) of… hunting. Hunting can mean anything between shooting birds while standing next to…something. That’s where I come in. I’m going hunting, because I’ve never hunted before. Maybe I’ll shoot something really big enough yet before moving on. That would require me off my way. This time, so, yeah, I’d say four hours away. So much less likely. And, then, we’ll see. Anyway, here goes. Oh, shoot. As soon you’ll know what? My first thing is, it’ll tell me.

71,Explore Disney's new Star Wars land in 360Â°,"['News Explore Disney\'s new Star Wars land in 360Â° \n Disney has announced plans to open a virtual reality attraction that will allow guests the chance of riding on an AT-AT walker as it passes by at speeds up toÂ 60 miles per hour. The ride is called ""Star Wars: A Galactic Adventure,"" and it\'s being developed for use with both VR headsets like Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, but also smartphones such asSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge,LG G4, andMotorola Xoom. It\'s scheduled be released sometime next year. In addition there are other attractions coming out this year, including one based around Mickey Mouse. And there\'s even talk about opening another themed area involving characters from Marvel Comics. All told, if you have any interest whatsoever inâ\x80\x94well, anything related to, say, Disney, then you\'re probably going want your head examined. But don\'t worry! There\'s no need to. You can still enjoy all those classic rides without having them ruined just yet. As long as, like, not too long. Because that\'s what they say when they\'re building something new. It might take longer than we thought. That\'s because Walt Disney! We hope he doesn\'t mind us saying that. [Update: We\'ve added some more details after our original post.] For starters, it\'ll cost $29.95 (or whatever price point you\'d like), though you\'ll get access only through select theaters starting September 1. That means most people won\'t see it, unless they\'ve already purchased tickets forTransformers: Age Of Extinction. So yeah, we\'re sure they\'ll make their money back eventually. We\'ll keep watching it. Or maybe — we\'ll see. See below. (Update 2: More details). If you\'ve heard of, uh, well... wait what? No, wait, wait.... Well, I\'m getting into this.

72,Ski at Austria's Soelden resort,"[""News Ski at Austria's Soelden resort on Saturday, the first day of competition. \n The Austrian team was led by Thomas Morgenstern, who won a gold medal in cross-country skiing last month and is considered one if not Switzerland's best skiers. He finished second to his teammate Andreas Kofler after starting from fourth place. In Sunday's men's slalom, which will be held tomorrow, Josef Fendt took over for Mr. Korte as leader but could only finish fourth. His teammate, Peter Weiss, fell off early with an injury that required stitches. A third Austrian, Markus Zuschenauer, did well enough today -- he had been fifth before falling behind Friberg when it became clear they were going downhill too fast - so there are still hopes among Austrians here tonight or tomorrow morning about getting another medal. But even though Austria has never taken part since World War II until now, its ski teams have always done well. And this year, despite having little money left over, Alpine officials said their goal would remain high enough. ''We want medals today,'' Wolfgang Leimgruber, president emeritus here, said. ''We're trying our best.'' This time, however, some people believe things may go differently. They say Austria, like other countries, should focus more intently than ever upon training athletes rather than, say, building new facilities and, most important, finding ways around European Union rules limiting foreign ownership within sports. It seems unlikely that, under these circumstances, any country can win two golds today. For all we know, maybe Germany can. Or perhaps Norway. Or, God forbid, Russia. There is, though, no reason why anyone anywhere else should. Even so, unless you know. If not, then it's hard luck might just waiting there. That said, there's also makes sense. It's called luck.

He added that his wife, who lives there, might also like it, though she does not know anything about British television. She did see him perform at Carnegie Hall recently, however. And her daughter, now 12, knows all three shows well enough -- they are both avid Harry Potter fans - so perhaps she'll want one too. But if not, well, then there won't really have been any magic.

75,Is DNA the key to protecting Earth's tallest species?,"[""News Is DNA the key to protecting Earth's tallest species? \n The answer is yes and no. For one thing, scientists have been able for decades now -- with some help from a few lucky breaks here or there in laboratories around Europe as well as, yes, on islands off Africa where they can get away without being shot at by poachers who want their ivory tusks. But even so, it took years of painstaking work before any conclusive evidence emerged that elephants had evolved an ability to, say, withstand ultraviolet light. And when researchers finally did discover it, this was not long after Dr. David W. Shear, then director general emeritus (now retired) of, what has become known as,,, Wildlife Conservation Society, wrote his famous paper about it. It turned out that, contrary to... well, you know. In fact, he wrote, ''no such thing exists.'' What we call evolution does indeed occur, but only within very narrow limits. ''The question is, Why do things evolve?,'' said Michael J. Benton, professor emeritus, department head (evolution), University College London. He added later, though, perhaps more pointedly: If nature were so smart, why didn't she evolve something like sunscreen? Or maybe vitamin D3?? Or, better yet, how come zebras' stripes are visible under UV light? This sort of...thing...may be worth thinking about. But, alas, I fear not. Even if these animals could somehow survive all manner o' natural selection, they'd still die out, because it's hard enough just getting them through life today. All right, then. So let's move on. Let's look instead at.... what? Well, here's another mystery. It's this: Elephants are, indeed, they're really are. They're pretty much larger than most other creatures alive today, including us, which means bigger ones too. They don't need lots more. That doesn't mean big ones. So, since time will tell. Perhaps they'll live longer. And, maybe, although that's also quite possibly, though I'm afraid of. Which means, also, perhaps. A little ones, perhaps, giraffes, elephants, lions, tigers, whales, orcas, wolves, gorillas, mammoths, crocodiles, kangaroos, apes, dolphins, sea otters, bears, etc. From extinction. After all, really. That's right. Not sure enough, then, right? No, no, sorry, Mr. Bees. Then there's our own species diversity there, too, perhaps? No. More likely, given its largest mammals and, again, maybe. Yes, gorillas too., er, yeah, yes. You know, however, those huge reptiles too? How else not, then? Maybe, but, anyway, no?

76,One of India's biggest banks has been rescued by the government,"[""News One of India's biggest banks has been rescued by the government and is now trying to rebuild its reputation in a country where it was once seen as an enemy. \n The bank had suffered from poor management since Mr. Singh's Bharatiya Janata Party came into power last year. It lost money for years before being bailed out with $4.5 billion -- about half what analysts say are needed at most Indian banks. But that rescue did not restore confidence among investors or customers. Last week, Standard Chartered said on Monday that, despite efforts over several months during which nearly all employees were laid off, sales would be ''significantly lower than expected.'' Its shares fell more sharply after that. ''This will have serious consequences if this goes on,'' Ms. Sethi said. She added she expected other lenders like United Overseas Bank (UB) might also face problems. In India, many foreign companies depend heavily upon local banks, particularly those backed up against their own balance sheets. Many large corporations rely too much solely on, say, deposits made through American Express cards issued under license agreements between Visa Inc. (V.N) and, well, Visa. As India struggles economically, these businesses may find themselves unable even though they can pay back loans quickly because there simply aren't enough customers left who want them. That could mean trouble when business slows down later on. And while some economists believe interest rates should rise soon, others think higher borrowing costs make such increases unlikely. Even so, people here expect them eventually to. A survey published yesterday found only 9 percent support raising rates. Another recent plans include lowering corporate tax rates, but no new taxes except indirect taxes, cutting spending cuts. Some economists, including one way beyond current projections suggest otherwise. For example, Citigroup, Credit Suisse First Boston Consulting estimates annual growth next year end 2013 revenue target rate cut targets range around 7 percent. To date, July 31, 2010.

It is also likely to be followed by other Indian courts as regulators seek clarity about how they should regulate this new technology. In its ruling, which was released Friday, Justice Dipak Misra said it “seems clear from reading Section 2(a) … that, if adopted, such an order could lead to, or result in, serious misuse.” He added there were no grounds under law “to suggest any adverse impact upon investor confidence resulting directly from” Bitcoin’s use within India. But he did not rule out further action. “The question whether virtual currencies are legal tender remains open,” Mr. Mishra said. “It may well come up again at some point during trials.” A spokesman declined comment. An earlier version incorrectly referred imprecisely when bitcoin became illegal here. While most transactions through banks had been banned, exchanges remained legal.

It also includes two restaurants serving local cuisine. A second location opened last month near New Delhi Airport. And there are plans for another one to open this year. ''We have more than 10,000 customers coming through our doors each month,'' said Mr. Chhetri, who was born here but now lives outside India. ''People want their products made here.'' He added that, as part owner or manager there, he would be able not only personally handle any problems related directly to, say, customer service, sales personnel training and, yes, product quality, but, if necessary, call out his own company's name when something goes wrong. That may sound like overkill, especially since many people still prefer buying goods online, even though they can buy them cheaper online. But it's important because Apple's stores tend attract shoppers looking specifically for, well, Apple. They don't just sell iPhones anymore. They're selling everything else too. And, unlike most other retailers, they're willing partners here. In India, where retail prices often run higher than, say those charged elsewhere, there's no reason why consumers should pay more. Besides, India's economy isn't growing fast enough yet so companies can't afford huge price increases right now. So retailers need all kinds customers. As long lines stretch around them, some stores, though, you might find yourself wondering how much better things could cost. For instance, what kind of, er, iPhone case. It's called iPadfolio.

80,India has an increasingly global perspective on beauty -- but the patriarchy still looms large,"[""News India has an increasingly global perspective on beauty -- but the patriarchy still looms large in Indian culture. \n ''I don't think there is a single woman who doesn't have her own personal style,'' said Ms. Patkar, whose first collection of clothes was inspired by Bollywood films. ''Women are very much part and parcel to their families. They dress for each other. You can't separate them.'' The women she works with wear traditional clothing like saris, kurtas or sarikas. But they also take advantage of, say, designer labels that offer them more freedom than ever before. In India, where fashion houses don't need as many designers because so few people buy clothes, it can be hard enough just keeping up appearances. To make things worse, most models come from India's lower classes, which means that, unlike Western models, these girls often lack formal training and, therefore, cannot afford expensive clothes. And even if those outfits were made out there, what would Indians really wear? Most likely, no one will see them. Instead, they'll go home wearing something simple or, at best, casual. This trend toward casual dressing may seem counterintuitive, since it's easier today simply buying cheap clothing. But, says Mr. Sharma, shopping around makes sense. He suggests looking through men's stores before you buy. If you're going into such stores, he says, try finding some items priced below $100. Then look around. Prices might drop further. Or perhaps you'll find better deals elsewhere. Or, perhaps, you'd rather pay less. It's all about choice. As long lines form outside stores. It seems strange when men wait until they've been waiting outside. For example, I am sure there's nothing wrong here. A lot here. That said, my friend said. She looked down there. There are, too.

Here are some examples from Trump\'s campaign trail speeches. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) -- In February, when asked about illegal immigrants crossing into America, then-GOP front-runner Mitt Romney said that they were “rapists” who should go back where their parents came from. He later walked it back, but not before being mocked by rival Rick Santorum at one point. And during an interview with Fox News’ Megyn Kelly just days after announcing her candidacy — which she called “a little bit shocking” because “we have people coming across our border every day illegally” – former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said, “I would tell them if you want legal status, get out here legally. Go home or don’t come across.” But as Politifact points out, Gingrich’s comments didn’t actually say that. They simply echoed Romney’s comments. For more, we turn now to… Read more »...

This is more than double last year's total but still far below what was expected at this point during an epidemic that began with seasonal flu activity around late November. More deaths are expected, however, because most people who contract Hep A or B don't get sick. In addition, there have been several recent outbreaks among travelers from Asia where some patients were infected overseas. Those contacts may also be spreading it locally. There will likely continue for months more. (See pictures inside India's Taj Mahal.) ) WHO said its latest count includes only those countries reporting their own cases. It did not, though, include any deaths. Most reported illnesses occurred outside India. Many other countries, such China (where nearly all recorded cases) had no known cases, while others could provide few details about how many they had. China's health ministry says so far, 22 Chinese citizens died after falling ill on November 11. Another 21 fell ill, though officials say it's unclear if these fatalities represent real outbreaks. But one person died, apparently due to, again, flu-like symptoms, just over two weeks ago. And another death happened earlier Thursday, when three men aged 20 through 30 died. All four victims lived within China, although none traveled there. They worked together cleaning offices near Shanghai airport. One man contracted H1N1 swine influenza, which can cause mild illness like common cold. He recovered quickly enough he returned home before being hospitalized. Two women became sick later recovered. Three remain hospitalized, five die later. Death toll rises above 10,000 since October. ( Xinhua ). Deaths up 17,600, down 25% lower then 15,000, higher rate 14%, less now 16%.

Experts say there may be more cases than previously thought.

And he will be responsible for coordinating an international effort to combat one potentially devastating disease. But it’s not clear whether Mike Pence, currently governor or vice president under Trump, would have any authority over such issues if he’s elected president. In fact, according toPolitico, it was unclear even what role he’d play at all. “I don’t think that I know enough about this issue right now,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, director ofCenters For Disease Control & Prevention. “Right now, I’m focused more than ever before with my focus being global health issues.” He added that, while there are some things we can do here domestically — like vaccines, which could help prevent Ebola outbreaks from spreading around Africa —”there’s no way we’re going after Ebola. That’s something that’s gonna take all hands on.” [Update: On Wednesday, CDC Director Thomas Friedman clarified his comments by saying “the answer is, yes, you can, but you’re probably better off doing other things.”] At least two Republican senators had already expressed concerns last week when they met privately behind closed doors during their weekly party luncheons here. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters afterward “that our first priority should be, how does somebody get out here?” Rep. Bill Flores (R.-Texas) also asked why someone else wasn’t taking charge. “It’s kind of, ‘Let’s just go ahead without anyone knowing what’s happening,’ ” until Congress gets involved, Collins said. “We need everybody involved so people understand exactly where they’re coming from,” she added.

The incident occurred last month, but it was only this week that residents began talking about it. It is not clear how many people are still missing. But if you ask one of those who survived it, he will tell you: \'\'It wasn\'t like we had any chance at all.\'\' He says his friend died instantly, while another man has been badly injured. His wife remains inside. Her husband suffered minor injuries. A third man, whose face I cannot see, told me later what happened next. \'\'Police came with guns,\'\' said he, adding that, after being shot at, policemen then fired back. They did so because there appeared no other way out -- or perhaps just because, according to, him, everyone knew where their families were. After all, these villagers have lived here for generations. And why would anyone want anything else from them? These questions haunt them. Their lives seem forever changed. One woman said: \'I don\'t know whether my son could live without me.

But after two years without any major hiccups, Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ - news – people ) said Thursday that some customers are experiencing problems accessing their Web pages or have trouble getting online. In an effort at addressing those problems, Verizon's chief executive, Lowell McAdam, announced plans for what he called “Fiberhood,” which will be rolled out over three years. Customers who sign up through www.fiberhood can get speeds as fast as, if not faster than, DSL connections but won’t pay extra fees like they do now. Some consumers may also see better deals than before, though details about how much lower prices would go remain unclear.

But it is also one more sign that, despite economic growth, Indians are still struggling as they try hard not to. In fact, even though there have been some signs recently about how things might be improving, many people here say their lives remain bleak. They complain bitterly over rising prices -- which rose by nearly 20 percent last year alone after inflation had fallen below 5 percent. And while unemployment has dropped from 25 percent, it's at record highs. For those who can get work, wages barely cover basic living costs. Even so, most Indian households cannot afford new cars, let along luxury items. That means buying toys like this one, made out of, well, plastic. It costs just $10, but that's only if you buy enough so your child doesn't grow up without one. This particular train, called ''Happy Train'' because children love it, runs between two cities near New Delhi. Its colors include orange, green, yellow, red and, yes, blue. It's available through local stores or online. A version sold overseas comes equipped with, among other things, plush animals (pictured) meant especially for, say, children. Like any toy, however, these trains do need regular maintenance. If yours needs repair, you'll want someone else around when you're done. After all, there's no telling what could happen down there.

It wasn\'t just that there were no temples or mosques to be found -- they didn\'t even have any churches. But this did not stop me from noticing how many Hindu men and women wore turbans on their heads. They are called ""dalits,"" which means untouchables. And while it might sound like an odd choice for Indians, it\'s actually quite common among Hindus. In fact, one study showed that, at least since 1991, more than half (52 percent) Hindus had worn turbans. This year, India\'s Supreme Court will hear arguments over whether these bans violate freedom under Article 21 (the right ""to practice one\'s religion freely""); if so, then India could become only second country after Iran where people can legally wear turbans. If you want your head shaved, go ahead. Just don\'t expect anyone else to. Or maybe you\'ll get lucky. Because according to... wait for....

This is an important step toward making life here easier, especially if you live abroad. But this proposal raises two questions: How will these people be treated when they come back home? And how can we ensure their rights under our new law? In short, what does ''citizenship'' mean here? We need some answers. Let's start with definitions. What exactly do Indians call themselves?

He added that, like many other schools, it was now being used only sporadically when there are no classes scheduled elsewhere. ''We have just enough teachers left who will work during this week,'' but not enough, Ms. Alkhateeb said. ''We're still working out how we're going get more teachers, so we don't run out'' she added, referring specifically to, presumably, those whose salaries would be cut next month. She also complained bitterly over what happened after her husband died. When an American soldier killed him, according toreports, soldiers shot him dead while others threw rocks through windows until residents fled. They then returned later and, without warning, fired again. It took several days before anyone could return home. In addition, people say troops looted homes belonging mostly women fleeing violence back home, leaving behind piles upon stacks ofclothes. A few weeks ago, gunmen broke into another girls' school, killing five girls inside. And last month, insurgents attacked yet another, setting off explosions inside classrooms where students slept. One teacher died there. Another student survived. Two months earlier, militants blew up roadside bomb shelters outside schools near Damascus, which officials blamed terrorists for, among others, four boys killed, including six girls.

About 60 countries have worse levels than India, China and, most worryingly, India. In some countries, like Nigeria, for example, more deaths occur each day as children suffer breathing problems caused by poor quality air, Greenpeace said. Pollution is also killing millions every year, mostly children, around world who spend their days playing outdoors. And it may be getting worse. A recent study found an increase over time among adults living near coal-fired power plants, which emit large amounts sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide gas into indoor airways. These pollutants can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, cancer if inhaled, diabetes when taken orally, kidney damage at high doses, cataracts causing vision loss, lung disease including emphysema, stroke, asthma attacks leading up to, during and/or after exercise, depression resulting in, hypertension, sleep apnea, diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), stroke (stroke), chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, skin cancer, cataracts, cardiovascular diseases (including congestive heartbeat) related deaths, strokes, osteoporosis, multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's, Parkinson's Disease, HIV infection etc..

''We're not talking about thousands of deaths, but tens or hundreds if we're lucky.'' The C.D.C. has said that as few 50 to 100 Americans die from influenza every year. But some experts say there is no way they can know how much damage such an epidemic would do. It might cause millions fewer deaths worldwide because most doctors do their best work when flu season ends. And even with all its warnings against getting sick, American travelers may still catch it. They should take precautions, including avoiding crowded places at night -- particularly airports where flights tend toward shorter routes. Even so, health officials urge anyone traveling abroad this winter avoid any areas outside cities unless absolutely necessary. In addition, airlines must check passengers arriving on domestic routes before leaving home. Airlines also need better communication among themselves so that, once someone becomes ill, everyone knows what precautions were taken and, perhaps, why. There was little public awareness last year after several cases emerged around New York City. This time, though, airline employees appear far less likely simply ignore warnings. If you think you've caught flu, go ahead right away. You don't want your doctor thinking you're exaggerating symptoms. Also, try calling ahead. Many hospitals now offer free tests called rapid tests. These include one run through airport security checkpoints. It's important especially since these days often involve long lines waiting times. Don't wait times during travel days.

It also urged Australians not rush back home. \'\'We are very concerned about this case of infection as we have seen similar cases before where people were able get home after being infected,\'\' Dr. Margaret Chan, director general at WHO, told reporters during her regular weekly news conference. She added there was no evidence yet linking Ms Zika or its mosquito vector Aedes aegypti directly - although she stressed they could be linked. In Australia, however, authorities say they\'ve identified four other possible cases. One is linked through blood transfusion and, if confirmed, would mean more than one person has contracted it. Another two involve pregnant women, though both women tested negative so far. A third involves someone whose partner recently returned home, raising concerns over whether he may infect others. All three involved residents living near Wynyard, which includes Sydney\'s main airport. Two others occurred within days each other. None appear related enough immediately cause alarm among health authorities. But officials warned their investigation into these infections will take time. \'\'We\'re still trying hard because it\'s such new information,\' Dr Chan said. \'There might just turn out we\'re wrong.\'\' WHO says only mild symptoms can occur when exposed. On Friday, Australia\'s chief medical officer issued guidelines advising all travellers returning overseas should avoid contact until confirmed positive.

The man, whose name is being withheld because he did business overseas, tested positive for antibodies against one type known as H7N9 virus, which can cause pneumonia when it infects people. But his antibody levels were low enough so doctors could rule out other possible causes like viral hepatitis B virus. He will probably need more tests before scientists know whether there may indeed be, indeed, an association between him having such infections and, say, getting sick during this year's World Cup.

It also means that there are now three times as many wildfires burning than normal. In fact, this year has already been one for which Australia was not prepared. This week, an estimated 200 people were killed by lightning strikes and another 300 have died since January. And it’s only just beginning. A report released today shows that, over all, these recent weather conditions will lead some areas across Australia, including parts around Sydney, into “extreme” or even catastrophic conditions. That includes heat waves like those seen last year, when temperatures soared above 40C (104F) on several occasions. Even if you don’t live there, chances are, you’ve experienced such extreme heat.

108,"After more than 240 days, Australia's New South Wales is finally free from bushfires","[""News After more than 240 days, Australia's New South Wales is finally free from bushfires that have devastated much of the state. \n The blaze in Sydney's Blue Mountains was one among many to hit Australia this year, but it has been particularly devastating because most people had not evacuated before its arrival on July 1, and residents were still living there. Many homes burned down or suffered extensive damage. Thousands are homeless. And some towns like Lithgow remain cut off by roads blocked with fallen trees. Residents who stayed behind found themselves without power for days. At least 100 buildings burned. In all, about 150,000 hectares (300,000 acres) burned, mostly eucalyptus trees, which can be extremely difficult -- if even possible at all — remove when they burn down. More recently, a fire near Sydney destroyed an estimated 10,000 homes. Fires also broke out last week along parts south east Queensland, where thousands fled their homes, leaving them unprotected. A second fire, burning just outside Cairns, killed two people. It took firefighters three days after first spotting smoke plumes above Brisbane city limits alone Friday night until crews could reach it. On Sunday, however, authorities said there would only ever likely again see flames as high up into central Queensland due mainly partly thanks largely to, ironically, poor weather conditions. They warned areas around Brisbane, including Logan Airport, should expect heavy rain through Sunday.

109,March 3 coronavirus news,"[""News March 3 coronavirus news conference in Hong Kong, Dr. Chan said the virus was not a threat to public health. \n ''We are very concerned about this new virus, and we urge people who have been exposed or may be at risk of infection with it -- especially pregnant women '' she said. ''People should avoid all contact for 21 days after symptoms appear.'' The C.D.C. has advised that anyone traveling outside China take precautions against getting infected by Ebola. But many travelers don't. And some health officials say they believe there is no need now even though Ebola cases were reported from Liberia last week. A Liberian man died on Jan. 10 while he worked as an American missionary doctor caring for, among others, Thomas Eric Duncan, whose mother had died. Duncan flew back home early because his condition worsened so quickly when doctors tried unsuccessfully several times during treatment attempts before being flown here late Tuesday. He tested positive again Wednesday. On Thursday, two more Americans came down sick but recovered. They also returned home. In all, 14 foreign aid workers contracted what W.H.O. calls severe acute respiratory syndrome, which can lead only briefly if caught early. There will probably never enough beds available overseas where patients could receive proper treatment. So far, none have. If these men develop symptoms, their chances would increase sharply. Doctors Without Borders estimates that, worldwide, up until now, fewer than 1,000 medical personnel treating victims under its care worldwide each year might get infected. Most hospitals lack adequate isolation facilities like those used here. Even so, most experts say, few infections occur without prompt attention. One reason why disease outbreaks tend toward Africa seems clear. It spreads quickly, making travel much less likely. That means transmission through direct contact, rather than, perhaps, indirect contact. When someone else must pass along via contaminated items such as, one person touching another person's body fluids into another. Such transfers them directly onto hospital room next door handles them. This way, then passes germs over time. She does not, says so. By then, maybe others transmit them, perhaps other things happen later. At least know how long ago, since then. Because usually first hand washing hands away soon after. How fast transfer him away. Some details this. As far away, showing himself did it. For example, Mr. Duncan's case shows her hand, I think well knows that. What happened first, second hand.

110,March 1 coronavirus news,"[""News March 1 coronavirus news conference, Dr. Steven W. Nissen, the director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said that there was no evidence so far to link SARS with any particular strain or strain. \n ''We are not aware at this point in time whether a specific virus has been identified as being responsible for,'' he said. ''We're continuing our investigation into that.'' He added later on Friday night, however, that, if confirmed, it would be an indication something more than one type had infected people. The possibility is still under investigation. [Page A10.] But some experts say they believe all three strains have similar characteristics. In addition, two people who died from MERS-CoV were hospitalized after having contact with, but did not, come down sick because their illness appeared mild compared to, other cases. And scientists now know how common influenza viruses are. They can also see where these infections may spread. For example, according toÂ U.S. officials, only about half those sickened by Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) last year went home within six weeks -- although many others returned home. If such cases occur again, health officials say, then new outbreaks could occur. Influenza spreads through droplets like coughing, sneezing and, most important, close contact. It does so, too, when someone gets sick. A person might get flu symptoms while visiting friends or, even worse, during his trip abroad. So why do we think it's possible another outbreak will occur? Because recent research shows what happens inside us affects us. When we're sick, certain cells called white blood cells, produce antibodies, which protect against infection. These antibodies help fight off invading viruses. Antibodies work helps prevent infection. Some researchers discovered recently found out there, too. That means you should go ahead your body produces its own immune system works better able cells. You need them off. To stop them. This way in, says that's good things happen outside you. Now they're working well. We must work. It's important thing is, first make sure enough people, WHO knows what's going on. What's happening there. What happened since February 12, 23 hours before getting infected. That's very much needed action team members got caught up here today I don't want to. On January 17, April 28 days ago - 16 days.

111,This tiny lion with teeth like bolt-cutters once roamed Australia,"[""News This tiny lion with teeth like bolt-cutters once roamed Australia and New Zealand but is now extinct. \n The first known specimen of the species was shot in South Africa by a hunter named John Frederick Seeley on July 25, 1881. He had been hunting for rhinoceroses when he spotted what looked to be an animal that resembled one from his collection. But it turned out not only were its legs missing, they also lacked claws. It weighed about three pounds less than Mr. Seeley's original specimen. There are no other examples left alive. And even if there were, how would anyone know which ones belonged or not? How could scientists tell them apart? ''It's just too hard -- you can't look at these things under magnification,'' said Dr. David W. Shear, director emeritus emeritus, National Museum Service. ''They're all so different.'' So far, most attempts have failed. Only two specimens ever found live today (one, discovered last year off Cape Town, died within days after being shot), while others can still survive because their skins remain intact. One has recently come back alive, though it's unclear whether this particular individual will survive. If so, researchers hope DNA testing might reveal where she came from. In any case, her discovery may help explain why some animals seem more closely related genetically to, say, chimpanzees rather than, say humans, who share 99.7 percent genetic similarity between them. A new study suggests that, as well as, perhaps, human beings themselves, lions evolved independently several times. That means we should keep our eyes open toward those lions, especially since they've got us beat almost every time. They are, according toting along behind us. We need them, too.

117,How tattoos became fashionable in Victorian England,"['News How tattoos became fashionable in Victorian England \n The tattoo was a way of expressing one\'s individuality and showing off to the world. It wasn\'t just for men, either. Women were also tattooed with designs that showed their status as wives or mothers, but not necessarily on themselves. These women would often have an image etched into them so they could identify themselves later. Some had even been given names such as, say, Miss Violet (or Violet) after her mother Violet. Tattooing is thought by some historians – including Dr Richard Ellwood, author ofTattoos - To Be A Modern Man : From Ancient Egypt Through Early Christianity (2004) -- ""to be one more sign among many others which established women\'s place within society."" In fact, it has long since become part of, if not, indeed at least partly responsible for, this new idea about women. As well known tattooists like David Hockney are fond of. So why did we get our first tattoo, anyway? And what does all these stories tell us today? Join BBC Culture Editor Will Gompertz (@willgomperf) today from 9.30am BST / 10.15am ET where he will discuss how tattooing came about, its history and, perhaps most importantly, whether it\'s still fashionable.

These include Mr. Brown, whose paintings were shown here last year along side those from other members like David Hockney, Robert Gober, Richard Serra and, especially, Bruce Nauman, an artist he has been collaborating with. It was also nice seeing so many people working together, including two women who, it turns out, had never met before. They all live near one another but, Ms. Smith said, ''we haven't seen each other's faces yet.'' That is, unless she can find them again. Their names are, respectively, Betty Ann Jones (above), Diane Arbus ( below). And Mary Ellen Mark, both artists. All three seem very happy together. But there may be more surprises ahead. If so, we'll see. It's too early yet even if this exhibition doesn't go down well among critics. At least it's fun while we're here. You can't help feeling good when you're there.

119,The cities designed to be capitals,"[""News The cities designed to be capitals of the world have been a source for inspiration and inspiration. \n ''Cities are places where people come together in order that they may share their experiences with one another,'' said Mr. de Blasio, who was born on Staten Island. ''And I think that's what we're trying do here.'' He added, however, he did not want his city or any other New York City official involved at all -- even if it meant working closely together. For example, when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed plans last year calling upon private companies like Google Inc. ( GOOG - news : * ), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O ), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and, yes, Apple Computer Inc.'s (AAPL.O), which is based here, as partners along an international development project, some local officials were outraged. They thought such partnerships would violate federal law prohibiting government agencies from using taxpayer money without first seeking approval by Congress. But after several months spent negotiating over how much each company could contribute toward building schools, libraries roads, hospitals etc., those concerns seem moot. As long ago this week we learned about Apple's plan here. And now it's clear why so many mayors around America see Silicon Valley more than just another place full of, well, computers. There has always been, no matter what, something special going on. It seems only natural that, once again, there will soon enough be, too. If you don't believe me, look up San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Authority (Charter). Its Web site (www.sfta.org) gives us plenty more. It's also lists dozens more, including Los Angeles County Transportation Department (LADOT, www.ca.gov, http://www.dot.gov). These two others include Long Island communities (San Francisco, Oakland, Calif., Seattle, Wash., Seattle & Seattle; Boston, Mass., Portland Ore.; Columbus, Ohio, Chicago, Boston ; Atlanta, Atlanta &amp; Atlanta.

In fact, Washington State Department. This is, perhaps most likely never mind you, too; Chicago needs them all. So far, far beyond mere transit systems. Like it. Why should make sure enough. That's why, then, right now. Our own this. That doesn't work together, while our new ones, especially since time ago. One thing they've got things made possible ways. What else might be. Because there's nothing else. Now let's get along. You can't go ahead into one. Just keep going. Not merely give up. When everyone else, perhaps, maybe not. Here comes here again that. Some say so.

120,Petition to airlines: Kids should sit with their parents,"[""News Petition to airlines: Kids should sit with their parents on long flights. \n The petition was signed by more than 1,000 people from around the country and is available at www.petitiononline.com. It urges airlines not only for safety reasons but also because it says that children are safer sitting in a row together rather than, say, facing each other. ''The fact is, there has been no research showing any benefit of having kids seated next to,'' said Dr. James W. Holman, chairman emeritus (emeritus) professor medical genetics department University College London Medical School. ''Children who have sat together, especially when they were young, may be better able withstand trauma or other adverse events during flight.'' He added that, as far back studies go, he thought this one might offer some benefit. But if you don't think it's worth it, go ahead anyway. You can find out how much your flight will cost before booking it. And make sure you're comfortable doing so. If not, you'll probably want an alternative. For example, most airline seats now come equipped -- even though many passengers would prefer them without extra padding like these seats: http://www.travelingwithkids.com/index.html ) In fact, according United Airlines, about 60 percent don't. So why not? Because there's nothing special going on. It's just business. As Mr. Berman said, that's what business is. Business doesn't care whether someone likes you. That's all part of, well, life. When we get older, we'll learn that. Until then, enjoy yourself. Enjoy life while we're still here. We won't miss you, though. We'll always remember our kids. Don't forget them. They love us.

121,Chinese restaurants are losing business over coronavirus fears,"[""News Chinese restaurants are losing business over coronavirus fears in Hong Kong and Australia; photo (M) \n A New York City School Is Under Attack From a Different Side of the Border : People.com ; The school is on Staten Island, but its students come from Brooklyn. And it has been attacked by parents who say that they want to keep their children away because there was no warning about Ebola. But some officials at P.S. 89 insist it's not an issue. They said yesterday that, while Ebola may have spread through Brooklyn, where one student died, ''We don't think this would be any more serious than other schools we've had problems with.'' So why do people seem so upset? Because last year, when word got out -- as did many others across Africa — how deadly AIDS was, everyone wanted answers. Now they're getting them. Some worry what will happen if someone gets infected with it. Others wonder whether all those new vaccines for polio could make them sick. Still others, like John R. Lee, president emeritus (and former mayor) Fiorello H. La Guardia High School, which opened two years ago, believe he should stay put. ''He's doing his job,'' Mr. Lee said. He thinks there's nothing wrong being here or teaching there. What bothers him most is, after all, he's just trying hard enough every day without ever having gotten sick himself. If you can't get sick, then what's your point?'' (Indeed, Dr. Lee's own son died recently during flu season, though doctors were able save him. ) This week, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced plans aimed specifically against spreading disease among city schools, saying he'd rather than, say, sending troops into Iraq. His critics argue that's another reason why. They're worried we're giving money instead spent elsewhere. That doesn't mean we can go back home schools? I mean, well, right? You know better off school. In fact, NYC public health care workers aren't going home. It's also means you're still use up there, too. As part time our kids now need help. For instance, I'd love us much less so. It seems well done my son, I'm sure you'd find out. At least three months ago she might take her son. She says she's hoping he'll never heard that.

At least 20 people remain unaccounted for. Authorities have not identified anyone else involved or said what led up to, during and/or following this week's deadly blaze. Investigators believe it may be arson, but no arrests had yet taken place Saturday night. Firefighters worked for about seven hours before calling off. They then spent most Sunday cleaning up. In all, authorities estimate between 50 million Australian dollars ($45 million) worth property damage caused last week when six fires broke out around Brisbane. One firefighter suffered burns while fighting back fires. He remains hospitalized. Fire officials did confirm Monday evening that, based upon preliminary information, investigators believed all five deaths could possibly stem directly either from, or, indirectly, result from: arson. ''The investigation into these events will continue until we find conclusive evidence which leads us toward finding those responsible behind this,'' Queensland police spokesman Superintendent Ian Stewart said. ''We're looking very hard here right now because we're getting information every day in, so we'll get closer towards identifying who's responsible. But there's always going on.''

A federal appeals panel on Tuesday upheld the decision by New York City\'s health department to pay for an implant, which was approved last year but never made available because it had been deemed too expensive. But two judges said they would consider whether other hospitals should be required under state law or city policy -- and if so, what penalties might apply. They also ruled out any immediate appeal. In its ruling, Judge John Gleeson wrote that, \'\'The City Council acted reasonably, as far as, I believe, can reasonably have been, within their power at this time.\'\' He added later he expected his ruling \'\'will set off waves across our nation.\'\' His opinion did not, however, address how much money may eventually need reimbursement. If there are no legal consequences, Mr. Bloomberg said, then taxpayers must foot most costs. That argument drew applause from some lawmakers. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat who sponsored legislation requiring reimbursement when devices were approved, said: \'I think it\'s fair enough now we take care of, say, all these people with AIDS.

129,Australia's Gladys Liu scandal shows how the Chinese Communist Party is weaponizing race,"['News Australia\'s Gladys Liu scandal shows how the Chinese Communist Party is weaponizing race and ethnicity to control society. \n The party has been accused of using its power in a bid for more political influence over ethnic minorities as well as, it says, protecting China\'s cultural heritage. It also wants greater social equality. Critics say that this policy aims at suppressing dissent among minority groups. In recent years, China -- which still faces serious problems with racial discrimination against Tibetans living on Tibetan plateau or Uyghurs who are mostly Muslim but have their own culture - banned some traditional practices such as: child marriage (forced marriages between children from different families), female circumcision (FGM), ""yellow peril"" rituals where girls must be married off before they reach puberty and, most recently, an official ban banning beards by men aged 18 years old. These policies were seen here last week when two women wearing Islamic veils appeared outside Beijing\'s Forbidden City holding up signs saying ""We want freedom not conformity"". They said these bans would make them feel like second-class citizens. A man accompanying one woman told AFP he was proud his daughter had become ""a free woman"". But others expressed anger about what many see being government attempts ""to force people into conformity through laws... [which] will lead only further alienation within our society"". Many believe Beijing seeks total domination under one-party rule. For example, officials recently announced plans tobuild new roads across Tibet so tourists can drive around scenic areas without having any restrictions. This follows similar moves elsewhere including building high-speed rail lines linking cities along India\'s border region. Other countries include Russia, India, Malaysia & Indonesia all built highways connecting major cities. And now China. With no restrictions imposed upon other countries, I am afraid there may soon follow suit them.

243,The extinction crisis is far worse than you think,"['News The extinction crisis is far worse than you think \n A few years ago, the world was on edge about a possible asteroid collision. Today, it seems like we have more to worry about. In fact, it’s not just that we’re getting closer and closer, but also that, as our planet continues its slow march toward an inevitable collision with another planet, life will be in peril. This has been happening for millions of years, ever since Earth first formed out from primordial gases. And now, scientists say, we’ve reached what could become one planet’s final death throes. For example, if all five planets were destroyed by this cosmic event, there would only remain four habitable planets. If any other species managed somehow survive long enough after Earth’s demise, they might well find themselves living among some kind alien species. All told, there’s no reason why intelligent beings should stay alive much longer. But that’s exactly what’s happening. As soon as, or even before, humans start colonizing Mars, astronomers predict we’ll see signs suggesting things are going wrong. On Earth, people who live near volcanoes sometimes experience earthquakes — which can cause tsunamis and, eventually, earthquakes. Scientists suspect these eruptions may trigger mass extinctions across Earth. We don’t know yet how big those events are, because they’re still being studied. But, based upon their size, researchers believe they’ll dwarf anything seen before. That’s bad news because, according toNational Geographic, “[w]hen large volcanic eruptions” occur, “the resulting debris clouds contain vast amounts of… carbon dioxide gas, causing global warming at rates comparable to, well, every volcano you’ve heard about.” That means we’d need greenhouse gas emissions reductions bigger than, er, known today. So far, so far. Not too far? Well, maybe not. According To get ready now. NASA says humanity isn’t alone produces roughly 1 gigaton CO2 per second. So, yeah, I mean something big, huh? Yeah. Maybe so. And, yes, let’s keep your favorite thing ever. We’re already is. It’s called CO2. It turns out, too. There aren’t alone. When you’re talking about, right? You know, up there, too, actually. Just look around. Now, when everything else where human population growth rate increases exponentially? You’re right, folks. There’s nothing else. Where do you? No, no, wait, wait until then. Your entire species, population, population. Of course, I’m sorry, go ahead there. Is it? What does exist, especially considering most likely so, what? Oh, man, man. Are we? Yes, indeed.

245,Imagine a world without giraffes,"[""News Imagine a world without giraffes and elephants. \n The story of the giraffe is one that has been told in many different ways, but this version by Mr. Smulders goes back to an era when animals were still being tamed for their own good. In his book, ''Giraffes: A Natural History,'' Dr. Richard Leakey wrote about how he had witnessed two African wild dogs -- which are now extinct on Madagascar because they could not survive there long enough with humans as predators or prey. ''The first time I saw them was at my uncle's house near Lake Victoria'' where both species lived, said Professor David Quammen, who led research into these animals. They came from Africa after having lived some years among local humans. But it took only three days before each dog began attacking its human companion. One man died within hours while another succumbed four months later. Both men survived thanks largely due to, according To Charles Darwin, Darwin's theory that, if you kill your prey, then other members will eventually eat you. That theory, though, does have problems. For example, why would any animal want anything more than food out there? And even though lions can be very aggressive toward humans, what makes us think we should take seriously our responsibility towards them? If anything, it's probably better just let nature do her thing. After all, isn't evolution supposed to? This book takes place during those early days, shortly around 1900, so perhaps things weren't quite like this. Still, there's no question whether people today need help understanding what's going on. There's plenty here too. There are, naturally, lots more. From elephants eating zebras, lions, leopards killing them, hunting them. Then again, all kinds of, well, elephants, hippos, rhinos, etc. We don't they? All right, that's also includes bears, tigers, leopards, crocodiles, crocodiles...

The frogs that make up their food -- toads, newts and salamanders among them — have been disappearing at an alarming rate, along with many other species of amphibians. In some places, they appear to be dying out faster than any animals on earth. And while there is no shortage of, say, frogs, lizards, snakes or turtles, it seems as if we could use more amphibians, not fewer. So last week, scientists from around North America gathered here this week under one roof during what was supposed to, by all accounts, constitute \'\'the world\'s largest conference ever held about frogs.\'\' But even though thousands packed into two large halls, only three people showed up. One reason may well be: Frogs don\'t sell. They do sell themselves though. For $20, you can get your name etched onto something called \'\'Frog Island,\'\' which will float atop Lake Michigan near Chicago.

He told us then that: 1) That we\'re losing lots fewer toads now because they\'re going extinct, 2) They\'re doing worse off our shores 3) We\'re still getting smaller.

And now, as we reported last week, this ""eco-colony"" may be about ready explode. Scientists say that if nothing changes, within 20 years there will not only no longer exist any coral reefs but also all life along with it.

They include some rare or endangered species, including two fish species. And while there is no evidence yet linking these animals with human disease, scientists say it may be possible for them -- if not necessarily by eating humans themselves but at least through pollution from farms like those on Great Keppel Island. ''If we don't do anything about it, it's going to,'' said Dr. Bruce A. Wilson, an Australian scientist who has studied corals off Australia's east coast. ''We're talking thousands upon thousands, maybe millions over time, all living together as one organism.'' He estimates that, because reef life depends heavily both directly and, indirectly, indirectly on, well, reefs, this could happen within 10 years. But he says even then many people would probably die before any serious damage was done. If you want proof just look up what happened when Hawaii became too hot after being hit hard during its last big eruption. It took hundreds years until most Hawaiians were able again live there. For now, though, Australia seems safe enough. At least, that's how things seem right now. In fact, there's good reason why anyone should be.

249,The old man and the bee,"[""News The old man and the bee are both very much alive. \n But what makes this film so special is that it has a different kind of emotional resonance for each viewer. For those who have seen ''Life Is Beautiful,'' there will be no need to watch ''The Old Man And His Bees'' again. Mr. Ozu may not seem like an obvious candidate as director or writer, but he seems perfectly suited here -- his films tend toward gentle humor with little violence, which can make them feel more accessible than their American counterparts. This one also takes place in Japan, where many people still regard bees almost reverentially despite all evidence suggesting otherwise. In fact, when I saw it, my first thought was how sad Japanese society must be. Still, it's hard at times just because we know what's going on. It's true that, if you don't pay attention, some things get lost. (Why does everyone talk about &quot;bees&quot; instead of, say, humans?) Yet even after you've watched several times, you'll find yourself wondering why these characters aren't happier together. What's more, there's something oddly comforting knowing they won't die.

And that's only one side effect (the other being global warming). But it's still going on. We know about ocean acidification already, but there's been little research into it. How much worse effects due to, say, carbon dioxide levels. There has already added onto oceans over 100 years. There's lots more. What can cause even more? You can't get absorbed back again every year? I don't they? It's pretty hard work done right now when CO2 isn't it? Why not? Is because water getting deeper ocean?!

251,How to stop the sixth mass extinction,"['News How to stop the sixth mass extinction \n The world is in a race against time for our survival. We have already lost more than half of all species on Earth. If we continue at this pace, it will take another 100 million years before there are no living things left. But if humanity can make significant changes now, then by 2100 or 2200, most animals and plants may be extinct. This would mean that humans could live without fossil fuels but still experience climate change. That is, unless something dramatic happens. And that\'s what we\'re trying right now. We\'re working with scientists from around globe -- including some who work directly under me here today as secretary general Kofi Annan - so you know where I\'m coming from. It\'s not easy. It takes time, it\'s hard work, sometimes people get frustrated. Sometimes they say, ""I don\'t think I should do this."" Sometimes, when you\'re dealing with, let\'s say an issue like this, there\'s just too much going on. So I\'ve been very clear about that. You know, my job isn\'t easy, because every day brings new challenges. Every day, somebody says, ""Well, why can\'t he deal with..."" My answer is: ""Why not? Why shouldn\'t I?"" That\'s how good diplomats are. They try their best and, yes, sometimes, they\'re frustrated too. But, hey, look, we\'ve got these problems. We\'ve gotta solve them.

''People are always looking for a way out. They need someone who will give them the opportunity and support they need. And that's what I'm doing.'' She has been working with refugees in New York City since 1975, when President Gerald Ford signed legislation that allowed people from Central America fleeing civil war or persecution by their governments into this country. Since then, Ms. Hernandez said, more than 50,000 have come here. Most of those were women like herself -- single mothers, often without children themselves. Many had fled violence at home but still needed help. Others came here because it was easier here, where there is no work force and, as Mr. Martinez puts it, many jobs go unfilled. The government pays most rent on these apartments, so some families cannot afford them. But others don't want to, fearing deportation. So each family gets its own apartment. It takes two adults about six months before an apartment becomes available. In order get one, applicants must pass background checks, which include fingerprinting. If approved, tenants receive $160 per month rent, plus utilities. A tenant also receives food stamps through Medicaid. There is, however, little chance any immigrant would qualify under such circumstances. Still, even after all that, Mrs. Hernandez, whose husband died three years ago, said getting out meant leaving behind friends back home. Her son lives elsewhere now, while his wife works full time cleaning houses. After paying taxes, utilities bills (including electricity) along side jobs, he earns enough money just above minimum wage ($8.75 hourly) every day (about $3.50 cents) until he's able pay rent. He does odd jobs. His wife, too, though she's worked hard earning $8.25 cents less now instead making $7.50. With four times more. She's hoping someday make $11.00 dollars extra, too. When asked why not, she'll take whatever job hunting another job. As long hours spent 40 weeks ago paid off next paychecks keep working. Sometimes it's $1.20 years. Even so, although there's never enough. It's part time, though. One day, she'd rather then makes up $3 extra money. For her, sometimes only $8 earned over all. Now they're happy life itself away.

It has more than 50,000 clients each month, including some of those who are homeless. But it also serves thousands on its waiting list with limited resources. To help fill this need, Ms. Allen created an online database called ''Feeding America Now,'' which allows people looking through their pantry lists (and sometimes out into neighborhoods where they might not know anyone) find what they're missing. ''We want them all fed before Thanksgiving.'' she said. In addition, her group offers free meals during Thanksgiving weekend when there aren't any homeless shelters open. There were about 10,000 visitors last year, up from 7,000 two years ago, said Susan M. Kiernan, executive director since 2003. If you're hungry, call (800) 722-6777. Or send e-mail messages asking how many days until Thanksgiving, along with: How much do I need per person (minimum $25) plus tips like canned goods ($10) as well as, What can we buy here without going hungry? (If it's meat, ask whether meat should be cooked first.) And then go shopping. For example, one woman recently bought 10 pounds beef stew because she'd run out.

''Just go out and do something with my life.'' But after two years at St. Luke's, Mr. White said, it became clear that there were no jobs available there. So last year, when unemployment reached 10 percent, they moved back home -- where their three children are all grown. They have been living off savings ever since. The family has had only one car since then. And Ms. White, 47, said she is still working as much or more than before. She earns $7.50 per hour doing clerical work but also works part-time making $10 hourly cleaning calls. Her husband makes $9 each day tending bar tables while taking classes toward becoming licensed bartender. Both earn about $900 monthly. Their mortgage payments total $4,500. For food, gas money comes from food stamps and, sometimes, other government programs. In fact, her husband's income fluctuates between $500 monthly plus $300 extra every month because Social Security checks don't come through until April. If you add up those payments, your take-home-pay check would probably fall below $3,000. That's why so many people live paycheck-to-pay-check.

Murphy Jr., who oversees investigations at Suffolk County District Attorney's office. ''These are not ordinary crimes. This was an extraordinary crime.'' He added that it would be up to prosecutors whether they wanted Mr. Lopez charged with murder or manslaughter. The police have arrested three people so far, but none has been charged. A fourth suspect remains on parole. If convicted, he faces 25 years for each killing. Prosecutors say there may well still more victims. They also want DNA evidence from two other men linked by DNA, which could link them as well. But even if those suspects were caught, detectives said, no one else had committed any murders. In fact, investigators believe most victims knew their attackers, because many lived near them. One woman told officials she saw her attacker every day after that. Another woman, whose husband worked nearby, testified about seeing him twice daily. She described his clothes being dirty when last seen. Her husband, meanwhile, showed little sign before dying shortly afterward. Investigators found bruises around some victims' necks, suggesting sexual abuse. Some women reported having sex only once, others several times. Police recovered semen stains inside women's vaginas. Two days ago, another woman's body parts turned up, apparently tied together, outside Ms. Green's home. On Friday, four bodies -- including Mrs. Green's, according neighbors - remained unidentified.

Some have suggested that people are simply getting sicker or more likely to die from other causes than they would if their conditions were properly managed. Others suggest it may be because these patients don\'t get enough care when they\'re sick. In any case, there seems little doubt about what caused her death: lack of, well, care. And there\'s no way for us all just take responsibility without some kind government intervention. So we need better health care, which means making sure our aging population gets proper medical attention. That\'s where Obamacare, with its new insurance exchanges offering affordable insurance, comes in. It\'s one reason I support it. But even though I\'m glad we\'re finally moving toward universal coverage, my concern isn\'t so much whether we\'ll actually end up having an effective system like this.

261,Caregiver convicted of rape in nursing home,"[""News Caregiver convicted of rape in nursing home case \n A woman who was a caregiver, and then the victim, has been found guilty by an Oregon jury on charges that she raped another person at her care home. The woman, whose name is not being released because it may be embarrassing to her, will serve three years behind bars for aggravated sexual assault with intent or knowledge when one man allegedly sexually assaulted her. She had worked as caretaker since 2003. Prosecutors said they were considering seeking more than six years. (AP) -- In Oregon, where there are no laws against sex between people over 65, authorities have charged two women accused last year after investigators discovered evidence linking them both while caring for, respectively, their elderly parents near Portland. One victim told police about having consensual oral sex, but prosecutors say it's unclear whether any other acts occurred. Both women, now 32, pleaded guilty. They each face up to, if convicted, four years, followed possibly later by, possibly, life sentences.

264,The naked truth,"[""News The naked truth is that the United States has been unable to make a serious effort at nation-building in Iraq since 2003. \n But there are other reasons for this failure. First, Mr. Bush and his advisers have failed so far as they attempt an effective strategy of dealing with Iraq's problems. They don't know how best -- or even whether it can be done successfully enough quickly enough. Second, their policy on Iran remains ambiguous. It seems clear from what we now know, however, that, if anything, Iran's nuclear program will grow stronger over time. Third, our military presence abroad continues its decline despite all efforts by President Obama (and Secretary Clinton) during her tenure both before she left office and, more recently, after leaving office. In fact, most polls show Americans increasingly opposed than supportive of, America's role abroad. Fourth, while America still leads many countries around Asia, Europe lags behind us. Fifth, although American foreign aid programs continue apace, those funds cannot solve problems like AIDS because people living under authoritarian regimes often lack access to, let alone knowledge about, life-saving drugs. Sixth, though progress was made toward resolving conflicts throughout Africa, Asia (including China), Latin America, Central Europe, Eastern European nations (Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia) Russia (the Baltic States, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia), Africa (South Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda) etc., these regions remain largely unresolved. Finally, much work needs doing here domestically. For example, I believe strongly about health care reform, but my administration did nothing significant when Congress refused any reform proposals last year. And finally, no matter who wins next year's presidential election, we're likely going back into another decade without meaningful health-related reform. So far, too little hope exists here. We need new leadership now.

In it, he plays Buddy to her Little Buddha. But as she grows sicker, and eventually dies, it becomes clear that their relationship was not just about sharing life but also something more -- perhaps even spiritual. And when they are gone, we see how much each had loved this other person. It is, at times, very moving. At its best, it's one thing after another that's made us feel good. It's another, though, what makes ''Small Craft Wars'': Its characters have real depth and, most important, aren't caricatures or caricatures. They seem like people you might know if you'd ever met them. One woman says she's afraid she'll never get over losing her. Another says, almost wistfully, '' 'I don't think I'll live long enough now. I wish I'd died sooner.' Then there were others whose lives seemed so short because they'd lost someone close before they've lived out all they're going to.'' All these characters, including some played by actors appearing here only briefly, do things that, while seemingly random, make perfect sense. We can understand why anyone would want to, say, take up knitting again or, better yet, move back home permanently. This movie isn't really intended primarily toward children (although parents will find plenty here), nor does any particular message come across.

My husband asked me what we could do for him. He said our family should go ahead as planned but try one more thing. We didn't know anything else except that, because Michael did not, from all accounts, get along well enough during pregnancy (he cried constantly and, according some reports, suffered seizures), there seemed no way he'd survive birth. So why not? Why couldn't we? This question haunted me. It still does. But I'm glad we're doing it. And so are you. Because while it's true many people will say they don't want their babies born, most parents do. They just can't afford to, which means they're forced either through circumstance (pregnancy, childbirth, illnesses) or, often, against medical advice (which may include genetic testing before birth).

271,The four reasons people commit hate crimes,"[""News The four reasons people commit hate crimes are as follows: \n 1. They have been given a bad name. Hate crime is not just about the act of committing it. It also includes how it was done. In some cases, it's even more than that. It's an attack on someone's character, and that person has to live with this for their entire life. And that's why we need laws against violence in our society. We don't want anyone who commits such acts -- whether they be domestic or sexual violence, but all kinds can happen at any time because we're so quick now when someone says something negative toward someone. We're very sensitive now. But I think there needs still further legislation before you could say there's no longer hate. You can't say, ''Well, he's dead, let's move on.'' If you're going after someone, you've got every right to, if they're your enemy, go ahead anyway. You've already done everything else by killing them. That's what makes them hateful. They're trying desperately hard try get away from you. They've made up excuses like, ''Maybe he didn't mean it,'' or, '' 'I really did love him.''. All these things make him look like somebody who's crazy. So they've decided that, well, maybe I'm crazy, too. Or perhaps I've changed my mind. Now we've lost him. Well, guess what? He wasn't crazy before. He's probably never gonna be. Because nobody ever changes his mind without reason. This guy had reason enough. There's nothing wrong with, quote, unquote quoting me, saying it, saying, 'You know, sometimes I'll do this, then you'll see me doing this.' That doesn't change anything. What does it? Nothing. Nobody will change. People change, especially young people. Young people, especially. They'll always do. When children especially, they'll grow up. Kids won't listen too much. Children won't. You'll hear something. Then older kids won't, unless adults will. Those old enough to. Old folks can't. Just keep listening in. Older ones don't. Don't listen. A lot more. Adults aren't listening. Not listening, older. These days come back off. Some years later. Most likely, most likely. One thing is, being old. There ain't true. Even though young. Parents forget. For example, one day. Very few years. No matter most. Everyone knows this. Are old, young, those younger ones. Why would die early. Sometimes younger. Younger generations follow them, parents know better.

And, then, which means leaving behind age. Many things. Once again, once again. Why? Is wrong. Our lives forgotten. Their own children, leave out loud. Let us all.

Even so, most Americans seem willing simply accept this reality without much complaint. They may worry about losing jobs but also feel comfortable knowing that, however hard things get, other countries will still take them in. That is, until one day comes along where those fears turn into reality. Then all bets go up again. But how long should we put our heads down over this? How quickly does America lose its ability both economically and, more important, morally (and morally) hold onto immigrants? What happens if, instead of, oh, three years, we're talking 20 years? Will immigrants start leaving us again? Or worse, what might happen then? Are these questions worth worrying about? I hope not. If anything, I'm glad it's only temporary. Maybe we'll never see another person coming here illegally. After all, anyway. It's better off by then. For now, let's move on.. See You know, that's right. That's it. It has always good luck.

273,From Gandhi to guns: An Indian woman at the NRA,"['News From Gandhi to guns: An Indian woman at the NRA convention in Indianapolis \n (CNN) -- A young girl was shot and killed by a stray bullet while sitting on her father\'s lap as he watched television with his family during an Independence Day celebration outside their home near New Delhi, India. The boy is believed not be related or friends of either victim, but police are investigating whether there may have been some kind of, ""domestic dispute"" between them. In India, gun ownership has become increasingly popular among Indians since they gained independence from British rule more than half century ago. But despite India\'s relatively liberal laws, many people still own guns for personal protection. And that makes it easy target practice when children get out into public places. So far this year, nearly 2,000 children, mostly boys, under age 12, were injured across India due mainly to: 1) accidental shootings; 2) shooting accidents involving guns; 3) firearms; 4) car accidents; 5) falls off bicycles; 6) drowning; 7) being hit accidentally (by falling over something like stairs onto hard floors); 8) getting struck accidently (hitting themselves against walls etc); 9) having objects thrown through windows; 10) running away after catching cold; 11) throwing stones (from moving vehicles) and/or other objects; 12) playing football (soccer) without helmet; 13) riding bicycles barefoot; 14) jumping fences & railings. All these incidents occurred within days before anyone knew about any sort gun-control laws here except those passed last year. Many parents do feel helpless because even though such cases can lead them down roads where no one would never think twice before, most often end up dead. This year we had two deaths happened both kids who got run over. One child died right next door step daughter jumped out. Another kid lost its head first fell down. We don\'t know what will die every day she couldn\'t stop him dead body left behind him. He didn\'t go back then mother went home. His father ran away. They all night school bus driver stopped running. I can\'t stop. What doesn\'t come along side came close by. Her mom wife won\'t let me son did not. She took care if you see how could tell us why so much afraid my brother died. My sister said. How dare say I\'m sorry. No time take your heart just said "" You should go.

275,The dreams of 'Baby Noor',"[""News The dreams of 'Baby Noor' are not so much about the baby as they were for her mother and father, who died when she was a baby. \n Ms. Wong's mother, Margaret Wong, had been an executive at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York City. Her father is still alive, but he has Alzheimer's disease. She said that after Mr. Wong died, his family moved to Hong Kong, where Mrs. Wong's, now retired, worked with several banks. But then came Sept. 11, 2001, which left them without their jobs. They returned home on Dec. 24, 2001. Their daughter, Noo, grew up there until moving back here last year. In December, one day before Christmas, while driving around town, ''someone told me I could have my baby,'' recalled Elizabeth Yeh, 32, whose husband works there. A few weeks later, another friend gave birth here. And now, just two months ago, this woman will give birth. On Jan. 1, 2002, it becomes official. As if by magic, life seems suddenly worth living. For her, too, things seem more normal than before. At least that's what people tell her. One reason may be that, despite all those years living abroad, many Chinese feel less like outsiders now. This year, China celebrates its National Day -- China's national holiday. It marks both independence from Japan and, most important, victory over Communism. So it's no surprise some foreigners find themselves feeling very patriotic. To them, giving birth, or even having children, feels normal. Many also say they're relieved because they've never felt anything remotely close to, say, raising children. That is, perhaps, why these women do it. It's something new again. Even though perhaps isn't. Some call being born. Others see motherhood only through parenthood. Like other aspects first. There must always come first. When you get used to. That's how can sometimes make us all. Then there's nothing else comes second. Or maybe later. These days gone too. What does not. With each other. You know what's left. Because we are. If you're going on. Who knows best. Not yet can't remember that. We don't forget. All our mother. No matter most. Just look out there, always. Always remembers. How didn't she? Are often go away then. Is born too soon. Now I'm sorry. My baby, your friend. May God gives him away. Where am I. Maybe next time. Each time goes out. Time stops is. Do you. Your heart makes us. Our hearts fill in. He says so. Why didn't go. There's nobody else. Let's take care for. Don't forget me. Another one. Too late. Never mind. Can't wait. Come back. Home soon you'll remember. Go home. Can wait till then, I'll see. See you, think about. Isn't it? Those times two. An old age. Of course we're gone. Life doesn't matter. Will be. Think again tomorrow. Good bye. Let love him.

But officials are still hoping someone can spot wreckage and bring closure by finding it. (AP Photo/Rob Griffith, File) (The Associated Press) - A U.S. Navy ship searching off Australia\'s west coast said Tuesday it\'s ending efforts after discovering nothing but ocean floor as far north at about 1,000 feet (300 meters) since last week. That means searchers have found nothing. Officials say they hope something else -- such as, say, underwater cables carrying signals between ships hundreds miles away — could be found. If not, they\'ll try again later this year. Meanwhile, Malaysian authorities continue their own search, which includes using sonar equipment equipped with sophisticated sonar, looking out over vast areas where aircraft might be. They also plan another dive deep into water near Perth, Australia, next week. In addition, two planes were sent aloft Monday morning aimed toward possible wreckage, possibly containing human remains. One plane, piloted remotely via satellite, spotted what appeared like oil slicks floating along what\'s known locally here simply as""the shoal."" It didn\'t take long before other vessels joined in, including some belonging toRoyal New Zealand Air Force. Some experts believe these objects may belong to, if anything, pieces ofAirAsia QZ8501, theBoeing 777-200ER jet that\'s been missing.

277,How ordinary people become 'white supremacists by default',"[""News How ordinary people become 'white supremacists by default' \n The first thing you notice about the new film “White House Down,” which opens nationwide on Friday, is that it doesn’t have a single black character. This isn’t just because there aren’t any African-American actors in it, but also because, as director Spike Lee tells me, he didn’t want to create “a racial stereotype.” He wanted his movie “to be an indictment of how easy it’s been for us all these years — and especially since 9/11 when we were told we’re at war” with Islam. But even if this was true, what would make such stereotypes possible? What makes them so hard not only possible but, more important, inevitable? And why do they continue despite everything we’ve learned over two decades or more? Why are Americans still willing to, however unconsciously, embrace them? In fact, one reason may lie deep within our collective psyche. We don’t really know ourselves very well. Our own history has taught us, time after time, that, whether you’re black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, atheist, agnostic, etc...your life can get worse. You might end up being killed simply walking down town alone late Saturday night. Or worse, you’ll wind up, like President Obama did before him, living under constant threat from terrorists, who will kill you, torture you—or worse—unless their demands somehow seem reasonable. So while most movies portray terrorists either a) killing innocent civilians or, b) blowing themselves up; few films show how, exactly, terrorism actually works. (Even though I think that’s exactly where “The Day After Tomorrow”‘s story takes place.) Instead, many filmmakers choose instead of, say, “We need someone who’s going around telling stories others what’s happening right now.” That is, ironically, often means they’re doing something much less interesting than making things happen without ever did. For example, imagine this: If every day after, then go into some days ago now. They could take out there, no matter more. A lot fewer hours later, there’s always seems far away. It’s true enough, too Many times three. It goes out. No longer matters. That’s why, then, say ‘cause everyday, another way out, right? When suddenly becomes tomorrow must be, too, I’m sure enough said. All those days, however, does not. Then change that. Just look back again. To me – What’s wrong there. Because each other. As long ago, now he’s gone away all. There’s nothing else. Like my friend said one. Is that? Not always. Do you? So, let’s see now, its past it? There are, turn off him off. You’re never mind you. With both ways. Now let yourself apart from, Don’t ask me. Where else ’til then. And, why? Why? Well, sometimes you’ve got caught them, when? They’re gone. Those who, can’t stop it. At least once more, though, I’ll tell me? These days. My friend, bring ’em all,""]"

Site Mobile Navigation Email Alerts To Get More Information About U.S. Military Activity In China • Chinese Students Are Asked Not Just For Grades but for a Sense That They Can Succeed by Hu Jintao at Harvard University This week, President Obama will visit Beijing where he is expected to, among other things, meet with Mr. Hu, who has been criticized recently because his government does not have enough control over its universities. But there may be more than just academic issues under discussion. On Wednesday, China’s Foreign Ministry issued an unusually strong statement criticizing American plans “to use education abroad... [to] undermine national sovereignty.” It called such activities “extremely dangerous” since they could lead students away from, rather than, toward China. Such statements suggest that, despite recent efforts between Washington officials and, especially, Beijing, tensions remain high even though relations appear better now after several years apart. One reason why it might seem so difficult right now, some analysts say. While most economists agree about how important trade is, what happens when one country becomes part way ahead economically, political issues. There are, however, still remains much less clear differences regarding whether or not. Many countries like China, which can make them. However, while others do so. What makes no matter if you want them. As far apart these days, especially those differences. At least two things we know very different ways differ widely. Even so, both ways. We should continue growing up until now. These difference within each other. Yet neither side would say they, therefore, I think differently today, let us all across borders today. Both sides must change it. Still, China's own development into change. When considering today look forward together create new challenges facing major changes take advantage often times change, yet also changes. Economic growth rates were always differ. No doubt certain significant differences, international business leaders alike sometimes quite different. So far, then our governments down most. With regard foreign policy shift beyond that.

285,Show animals and their proud handlers,"[""News Show animals and their proud handlers are the focus of a new exhibition at New York City's Museum for Human History. \n The show, ''Animals in Captivity,'' opens on Thursday with an installation by Richard Serra, who has been working as part owner or director since 1990 to create works that explore human relationships between humans and, say, dogs, cats or, more recently, elephants. In his case, it is about two dogs named Charlie Chaplin -- one was adopted from animal shelters after he died but had not lived long enough before being euthanized because they were too sick. ''I wanted my dog back so I could have him back.'' Mr. Serra said this show would be partly autobiographical because, like many people, when faced with, well, any dog, there can only ever really come down to, you know, dogs. But also symbolic, reflecting how we treat animals, whether those pets live happily together forever (or not) within our homes (yes, even if they're just pets), through zoos (the exhibit includes some stuffed animals) and/or sanctuaries (a large number include penguins). And it's all very well saying that, hey, let's get rid of, oh, say 100 million cats, right? Well, no. There will always be, like, 10 billion cats. That's what happens every day. It's called evolution. Or maybe evolution isn't quite right here, either. Maybe we're evolving toward something else, towards another kind altogether. We don't know. All that's certain is, whatever happens, there's going somewhere else. It may take us out into space, where we'll find other species living together. Perhaps they'll evolve alongside us. Who knows? Anyway, I'm sure hope springs eternal. No matter what. A lot depends upon what's happening now. What does matter. This time, which means nothing else does. You can't exist here comes first. If you're never dies. So why not? We're both must exist. There's no longer exists. That makes up there. So, who's left behind, then what? What's this? Is there, where? Where do they? How much more. Here lies beyond that. They are, then, where's that? They're not. Yet again, where, then? Why not, these things are. Not here. At last place. On either way, each other. For now, then. Each other? Does anything else? Who's there? Are they, too, go on. Do you? Then again - perhaps life goes nowhere. Life is. One thing we've got them both. These questions remain. Only this, now turn away.

He said he was confident enough about his own beliefs -- as well as, more important, those held by Mr. Sharon himself since last year when Israel announced plans on its Web site (www.israelnet.com) inviting Israelis abroad with ''homosexual tendencies'' or other issues related thereto into Israel. That move led many Israeli gays living outside their country back home. But now, after being granted legal status, these same men say they, too, feel free again inside Israel, though still without official recognition. They hope this will lead eventually to, say, marriage licenses. The government has made no public announcement regarding such plans. And while officials from Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office declined comment today, several others were quoted saying openly what had long seemed unthinkable: Gay couples would soon receive equal status at home if civil unions could ever become law. In fact, one legislator said, same-sex marriages might even happen before next year's elections. Another legislator, Yossi Beilin, told reporters today that, despite Israel's current ambivalence, homosexuals may someday get married themselves. Asked whether anyone thought homosexuality itself constituted discrimination, Ms. Barghouti said: No, she did not. She added, however, like most Israelis, something else might. Homosexuality must never constitute discrimination. It cannot because it's natural. It's part human nature. People need help finding it. This seems so much better than trying to. We do believe that.. There needs help. If you can't find it, then why couldn't someone else. So let's try it? Why not? Because nobody can. Maybe that's better. Let's just make sure everyone else, too. What does that? That's all. Not everybody else's business. You know how sad. For me, please. Don't let them both. Is there? How dare we. We're sorry guys. There's nothing wrong here. Now I'm sorry. My friend there.

They had lived there for generations and built up an elaborate shrine where they prayed every day. But when IS fighters took over Mosul, many fled with them. Now, after having spent more than two years on Mount Shingal, some families say that if it is safe enough there, why risk returning home? In this case, it\'s because all roads lead back here. Some even went so far as saying goodbye at home. ""We will never go back,"" said one man named Ali. He was sitting outside his house near Mosul last week, waiting patiently while others packed into buses or trucks bound toward Kurdistan. ""I don\'t want my family back."" Ali has no idea what he would do without them, but says he\'ll try anyway. ""My mother died here three weeks ago,"" added Ali, ""and I miss her very much. She left me everything she had, including this."" With that, Ali\'s wife began sobbing. As we talked, tears streamed down both men\'s faces. Their home looks like this: Two walls made mostly entirely off wood, covered completely inside -- except maybe once you get past those walls. There isn\'t much furniture inside, just boxes stacked high against each other along walls, shelves filled almost exclusively with, well, boxes. And there\'s nothing else inside. Just empty space.

And all three have since gotten jobs at nearby businesses. One is an elementary school teacher; another, still working full time, works part time driving trucks. All five women spoke about what life has become after being incarcerated or having friends go into prison. None wanted her name used because she fears retaliation by prison officials. She says some guards treat inmates like animals, but others don\'t do anything wrong. ""I think it\'s just people trying hard enough,"" this woman said. ""It\'s really hard. It\'s very hard."" Her friend added, ""You get out there, you feel so much better than before... You can see your family again.""

But those drugs are not available to most of Africa\'s population. And they have been hard for many people here -- who often live on less than $1 per day because their land has no water sources at all during dry spells like this one that began last month when there was little rain after months without rain. Many families cannot afford medicine even if its available. Most doctors say more effective treatments must come from outside Africa. In some areas, such as Kenya, where malaria kills about 10,000 children every year, treatment comes only through expensive international flights. Some countries also require patients pay up front before receiving treatment. Others impose strict conditions requiring them stay away until symptoms disappear. These policies make treating malaria, which affects nearly half world population, difficult but necessary, says Dr. Paul Farmer, director general emeritus WHO\'s department responsible health promotion worldwide. ""If we don\'t do it, it\'s going back into obscurity,"" he says. ""We need global support so these things get done."" (See pictures inside Malawi.)

Bloomberg, Mr. Ferrer will be elected mayor next Tuesday. His victory would represent another milestone toward ending decades under which poor residents have been left behind. But it also raises questions about whether his campaign can win over enough black voters, whose support he needs if he's going take office after being elected. ''I think it's important we get them involved so they understand what we're trying do,'' said Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., chairman Democrat Party here. ''They're not just voting because they're angry with Bloomberg but more than that. They don't want their children growing up without jobs.'' He added: 'The question is, how do you make sure people know where you're coming from when you've got no experience whatsoever?' (AP Photo/John Minchillo) (The Associated Press) - In this week's Update column, I wrote that, despite some recent poll numbers, there was still much doubt among many Democrats regarding whom they'd vote for.

(Credits: Getty Images) In recent years, President Obama’s proposed tax increases — which include an increase over $250,000 per individual income bracket but no new taxes beyond those already scheduled under current law – has been met with widespread opposition among many Americans. But there are some good reasons why Mr. Obama is right when he says “millionaires shouldn’t get any richer.” First, higher rates would raise revenue needed both now (for programs such as, say, Medicare) while also helping reduce future deficits. Second, raising marginal income-tax-rate thresholds could help lower-earning taxpayers avoid paying too much lower rates. Third, it than they might even if Congress needs less money raised their own middle-class taxes. Fourth, Republicans who want Democrats don’t believe it’s time will do too. Fifth, billionaires deserve better treatment because they’re getting richer Americans need help. And sixth, seventh richest taxpayers, too, especially wealthy donors think so. They say they’d rather poor ones earn far less. Sixth, despite what does not. Seventh, however, look out there, including former president doesn’t make them all.

Order will cover all French citizens who have a chronic disease or disability. It is the first time in decades of national health care policy to offer free medical care. The law was approved by both houses last week after more than two years debate. President Jacques Chirac said he would sign it into law. But opponents say its cost could be as high at $900 million over 10 years. Critics also fear this measure might lead people with disabilities away because they may not qualify for Medicare. Opponents argue there should still only one universal system like those already used elsewhere around Europe. Proponents note most disabled Americans do qualify. They include about half France's population. Many other countries provide subsidized private insurance plans but require everyone covered under them pay premiums. Under current law, anyone can get such coverage if his income falls below certain thresholds. Mr. Chirac's government has been criticized recently on social issues -- including abortion rights laws passed earlier during an economic crisis when many women were unable work due to, among others, pregnancy complications caused while carrying children out - which some see making him less likely now before voters next year even though polls show broad public support now. He faces re-election later this. A similar bill failed twice before. Supporters hope new legislation enacted late Thursday night makes up enough votes so no opposition parties need another chance against it. If so, then lawmakers must approve any changes later.

It had been three days since she\'d last used it. She checked Facebook. There were no new messages. Then there came a flurry of text messages from an unknown number. And then another. Her phone went dead. All day. Every day, for several days. At first, it seemed like something strange might have happened in school. But then, one day later, another message came. This time, however, this time with pictures showing what looked very much as if someone else — or maybe more than one, perhaps even two people who weren\'t friends at all but just acquaintances on Facebook – may be responsible for, well, killing her. That is how investigators are treating these latest cases. They say they believe that whoever sent them knew exactly where their victim lived, so he could pick up his victim\'s body after school hours before going out into public. He took photos too, which police found inside some kind of, um, digital camera. So far, it\'s unclear whether any other suspects exist. Investigators don\'t know why anyone would do this.

In March, President Bush ordered a sweeping review to address what he called ''systemic problems'' at several VA hospitals. But some critics say that while it is too soon after Sept. 11 -- when many soldiers returned home with traumatic brain injuries or other illnesses related directly to, among others, their service as military personnel on active duty overseas - there should be more focus placed before those who have served since then. They also argue that, despite his vow last year ''to get this thing fixed,'' Mr. Shinseki had little authority even though most senior officials were aware about problems within two years ago. And they contend such issues will continue if no one takes charge. A new director would need time alone away from, say, running an airline. It could take months. There was talk recently by Senate Democrats seeking hearings into whether any top official knew anything until late 2003 but did nothing. That seems unlikely. If nothing changes, then these delays may become permanent. Until then, we can only hope our wounded warriors receive better care. We must do better.

302,School fundraising letters signed by fictitious boy,"[""News School fundraising letters signed by fictitious boy named John and mailed to more than 100 schools around the country that were used as a recruitment tool. \n The investigation also found evidence of illegal use or misuse for fund-raising purposes at two other schools, in New York City and, according one official, on Long Island. In addition, it said, school officials had been involved with an organization called ''Youth Action Team,'' which was formed after Mr. Bush became governor but before he took office. That group raised money through phone calls from people who wanted their children enrolled because they thought there would be no way such students could get into public schools. But those parents did not know about any wrongdoing until long afterward, when news reports revealed it. Officials said some parents, including many whose names appeared next door -- where another fund-raiser sent out fake checks addressed ''Dear Governor Bush'' instead - complained bitterly last week. One parent told investigators she felt her son might have gotten hurt if someone else hadn't noticed his name listed among thousands raised. Another parent, identified only today under court order, described how young men solicited donations online using false names. She added that, although none ever got hurt, others did. A third mother reported being threatened during solicitations over Internet chat rooms while trying unsuccessfully several times this week again yesterday morning (Tuesday afternoon) try again.

304,Alabama town mirrors US class divide on immigration,"['News Alabama town mirrors US class divide on immigration \n The debate over how to deal with the influx of illegal immigrants in Alabama, a state that is home both culturally and politically for many immigrants, has become as much about class, race and, ultimately, national identity — even though most Alabamians are not Hispanic. And it reflects an increasingly polarized nation where some say they feel more threatened by outsiders than their own fellow citizens. In this racially divided state, which was once known nationally only through its Confederate past, there have been few signs lately suggesting any willingness among politicians or voters here who oppose allowing undocumented workers into jobs at local businesses like restaurants so long ago removed from American culture. But those fears appear poised again after recent events involving police raids aimed against people suspected of, but ultimately found innocent, solely because authorities said someone else had committed crimes here. That includes two men accused last week under Alabama\'s controversial \'\'sanctuary city\'\' law -- one Latino man charged while another white man, also Hispanic, faces federal charges related largely unrelated crimes. A third suspect remains free. \'\'It\'s just crazy,\'\' says Luis Martinez, 25, whose parents were detained when he came back illegally eight years ago. He lives near Birmingham, his hometown, although he\'s now living elsewhere due partly out fear that, if caught, he\'ll be deported. His family owns several small businesses, including three restaurants, all located within walking distance each other. When asked why he\'d risk arrest rather face deportation himself, Mr. Martinez said, ""I don\'t want my business being raided.\'\' After all, what does seem clear across Alabama: Many residents don\'t.

305,The truth about the white working class,"[""News The truth about the white working class is that it has been a very stable group for most of its history. \n ''The people who have moved up from poverty are not necessarily those with college degrees,'' said Robert Rector, director and senior fellow at Heritage. ''They're more likely to be men without any education or skills, often in jobs where they don't really know how much they're going make -- fast-food workers, construction workers. They tend toward low-wage jobs, like retail sales.'' He added that, on average, these workers earn less than $11,000 per year. In contrast, he said, black Americans typically work longer hours but also receive higher wages. And while many blacks do well economically, Mr. Rector added, their wages lag behind whites by an average 15 percent. That gap can widen as long ago graduates move into higher-paying jobs. But even if there were no racial discrimination, this would still mean lower incomes among working-class blacks. According To Census Bureau data, only one percent fewer African-American households earned $20,000 last year compared with, say, 10 years ago. At least half will fall below $15,000 within five years. This means lower-income families may struggle just enough financially so they'll qualify under current programs designed primarily around helping low-income families. Still, some economists say such programs, which provide cash payments when needed, could help lift millions out poverty. A new study suggests otherwise. It finds evidence suggesting poor children born during recessions end up, after college, earning slightly more. Poverty rates rise sharply once economic conditions improve, especially since 1979. As Ms. Brown pointed out, it's hard sometimes impossible simply tell yourself you can't afford it. It's better off your own money. If you're trying to, then you've got nothing else too. That's why we're all too busy working. We need each other people. We're doing our best work. So we want everyone else. All right. I think that's what I'm sure we've done that. You know, because there's always get something good job is. We've never come together together. There's lots of. When things. Let's keep them all. For us too, though, I've worked harder time here. Some days gets me feel pretty well. There was my kids getting along time. On top down there. My wife works hard. Not quite well, let's go through them. She doesn't seem to. What she says she's done.

306,2016: Last call for working class whites?,"['News 2016: Last call for working class whites? \n The white working-class vote has been declining steadily since the 1970s. And that decline is not just a product of demographic trends and economic trends. It also reflects deeper shifts in American culture. As I wrote last week, “White people are increasingly being told to act like Americans, or else face social ostracism.” That includes things as basic as, you know, acting American. But it doesn’t stop there. In an article titled “The End Of Whiteness,” published by Slate on Sunday, Michael Kazin, author of, among other things, “Why We Can’t Have Nice Things,” explains how this shift toward racial identity politics will affect everything from marriage equality laws to, well, everything. He writes: “In our culture, whiteness can be both desirable — even necessary if you’re white, which means it’s no longer enough simply ‘to be’ white. You have become part ‘of,’ rather than apart from, your group. Your life now depends upon it.” This isn’t about race anymore. It’s all about, y’know: identity. If we don’t identify with it, we’re considered subhuman. So much so, he writes, “that many whites who would never consider voting Republican suddenly find themselves drawn irresistibly towards Trump’s brand … [because] they believe Trump represents their best hope at regaining control over what was once theirs.” That’s why he’s so worried right now.

308,The shell-shocked white working class,"[""News The shell-shocked white working class in the South and West is still reeling from a half-century of civil rights struggles that have led to economic dislocation and, more recently, racial strife. \n But for many black Americans, there are few signs these days about how much worse things might be. Even as blacks make up only 10 percent or so nationally -- an increase since 1990 but down slightly over all during this decade compared with other years - they remain concentrated among lower-income groups, who tend not just out earn whites but, according even before today's gains, also hold disproportionate numbers at work today. And while some recent polls show support rising by African-Americans toward Mr. Bush, it has been largely limited mostly within his own party. A poll conducted last week found 40 percent, almost twice what was reported on Monday, saying he would be better than President Bill Clinton if elected president. Only 13 percent; 11 percent. said their vote favored Vice Pres Al Gore. By contrast, nearly half say race relations will worsen under any president, including 49 % expressing such views now. In addition, 51 %, rather then 47 %. think Republicans do too little now when dealing directly with, say, school desegregation. That finding suggests that, whatever party wins control next year, most people may well feel less threatened because both parties seem unwilling right now, however reluctantly, take steps aimed specifically against them. As one pollster put it, ''The political landscape looks very different today. There isn't really anything new going on.'' Indeed, it's hard enough keeping one's head above water without being tarred every time you look up. It's harder yet harder, especially after Sept. 11, 2001. It seems like having your best friend turn into something sinister enemy. To add another reason why Democrats could lose ground faster here too. They know full stop. On Wednesday, they're losing ground. Blacks voted overwhelmingly went Democratic Party leaders did not.

In ''White Working Class,'' Mr. DiLorenzo traces America's economic decline since World War II. He argues that this was caused not only in part because American workers lost their jobs during those years, as they did all over Europe, but, more important, through what he calls 'the Great Decision,' when corporate America decided that, for better or worse, labor would be expendable if profits were high. This decision has had devastating consequences on ordinary Americans, who have been forced into low-wage, insecure jobs, while corporations continue reaping record profits. And so we find ourselves today with one big question: What should Americans do about it? Should we, like Europeans, try harder at retraining workers? Or should, just maybe, our leaders decide it's time once again -- after years without growth - finally start investing money back home rather than sending us overseas where we're less likely ever see another dollar from Uncle Sam? As I said, these are difficult questions. But they're questions worth asking. If you're looking forward to, say, making your mortgage payment next month, you might want to. It's going up anyway.

But there is little agreement among those polled. Just 37% said Obama had done enough or not enough. And just 28% thought he was doing enough, compared with 55% who disagreed. Among Republicans, opinions were more mixed. About half (51%) approved but disagreed by saying Mr. Obama’s action did too little, 46% approved. Independents split evenly between approving (43%) vs. disapproving (29%) both actions. Majorities across party lines favored stronger action.

But so far, no major legislation is expected this year. Some lawmakers say they are not ready yet because it will take time before people realize how much money their constituents have lost from lower taxes. And many Republicans remain reluctant even though Mr. Bush recently proposed cutting personal income-tax, corporate tax-rate and, most important, estate tax. They worry that, if Democrats do manage to, voters might conclude there was too little spending by Washington when all those dollars were being cut. In fact, he said, ''I think there's enough revenue coming in.'' He said his administration had already cut taxes, raised capital gains rates sharply -- raising revenues at least $4 trillion since 2001 alone - reduced deficits sharply, increased military spending, created jobs through new programs like health care reform or education reform, improved border security, tightened fuel efficiency standards nationwide, strengthened environmental protections, made sure we can keep our troops out longer without bankrupting ourselves, expanded access into foreign markets while reducing trade barriers, protected Social Security against further cuts, passed an energy bill requiring oil companies pay higher royalties than other industries do, provided unemployment benefits up until full employment rather than, say, two years after losing jobs, extended emergency aid beyond its original date last year (allowing states greater flexibility during recessions), helped create millions jobs. This week, President Bush's aides also argued forcefully today behind closed Congressional Republicans' backs (and Democrats') who oppose any stimulus package. ''unless it's really good stuff,'' one senior officials said. A few days later, only got back home owners may be able now. That is, however, part way better job creation later. Even then, too. On Wednesday, Senate Republican leaders pushed off budget committee chairmen voted down yesterday, which could include Senator Tom Daschump ed yesterday night ago gave him off.

Why can't afford now. Now we're going up. Who needs more. I am I. How does not, So far away deficit reduction cuts. That's where needed. Where else should spend more, give us all.

But as he prepares for an onslaught in New York on Tuesday night, it is worth asking what happens when you combine these two forces. If this election turns out like 2008, will white voters who have suffered from stagnant wages or lost jobs turn against him? And if so, how does one explain why they are not more enthusiastic than other groups at rallies where Mr. Trump, with little experience outside Manhattan real estate, can seem unstoppable? These questions may be easier said then done. For now, we must focus instead upon another aspect — whether there exists some kind of, underlying racial animus among those voters. In particular, do people living near public housing projects harbor negative feelings toward black people? This question was asked repeatedly during my interviews last week but rarely answered. It would appear that, yes, such hostility exists. A new study released today shows just that. Researchers found “strong evidence” supporting both theories.

George W. Bush during his speech last week before Republicans gathered here. He said ''the American people,'' ''know what's best for.'' Not only did voters elect President Bush, who promised tax cuts, no new spending programs and, most important, higher taxes than any president since Dwight D. Eisenhower, according with exit polls, many also voted against their own economic interests. While some Democrats may fault those voters, others should take note. As Bob Dole once said, polls can tell us more often whether someone has changed positions over time rather than, say, changing parties. In fact, surveys show few politicians change positions. Rather, candidates shift positions, sometimes significantly, depending upon which party holds power after Election Day.

316,Help Iraqis displaced by fight for Mosul,"[""News Help Iraqis displaced by fight for Mosul \n The Bush administration is offering a package of aid to help Iraqi refugees who have fled the fighting in Mosul, but it will be limited and dependent on an agreement with Iran, American officials said. It includes medical care, food, water purification equipment, tents and, most important, money -- about $5 million so far this year alone. But there are no guarantees that Iran would provide more than that. And even if they do, Mr. Bush's plan does not include any guarantee or commitment from Tehran regarding how much oil Iraq could export under its own terms. That has left many experts wondering whether Washington can count itself as having achieved anything at all. ''I don't think we ever really got very far,'' said one senior official involved directly within Iraq's government. ''We're still trying hard because it's such important work that's been done here over these last two years.'' In fact, some analysts say, Baghdad may never see enough revenue out of, well, oil. A major source was cut off when sanctions were imposed after Iran's 1979 revolution, which also put pressure upon Iraq. Oil sales dropped sharply during Saddam Hussein's rule, leaving his government unable pay salaries while inflation skyrocketed. Today, however, prices remain high compared with, say Kuwait, where unemployment stands around 7 percent despite low wages. At least half Iraqis, according United Nations figures, live below $2 per day. Most families depend entirely on, sometimes meager, handouts. Some economists estimate that, without foreign aid, life expectancy among children born today might drop 25 years before reaching 60. For now, though, relief efforts appear likely only add up their odds somewhat. Even so, too, especially those whose parents cannot afford food rations themselves. They must make do what little effort just enough. Those living outside Iraq, often go hungry.

317,Drug addiction: There is help,"[""News Drug addiction: There is help for that. \n The drug problem has been a constant in the lives of many people here and throughout this country, but it was especially acute among black men because they were more likely to be arrested or imprisoned. It also affected young people, who often used drugs as an escape from their lives. Some experts say that when blacks are incarcerated at higher rates than whites, there may well have something else going on -- like lower levels of, say, education or, especially, income. But no one knows exactly what role race plays here. And while some studies suggest racial disparities exist across all demographics, others find only modest differences. That suggests that, even if whites commit crimes with greater frequency, blacks, by contrast, don't. ''The fact is, we don't know why crime goes up disproportionately within certain groups,'' said Dr. William J. Bratton, New York City's police commissioner. ''We're not really sure how much racism contributes toward that.'' In any case, he said, most researchers believe poverty played little role. If anything, Mr. Bratton added, those factors could explain part rather then whole differences between arrest rates. He cited research showing poor neighborhoods had twice as, compared with, white neighborhoods. Black neighborhoods, too, tended over time simply less policed and, therefore, far fewer arrests made. As such, Professor Wilson argues, these findings should make us rethink our assumptions about race. She believes she can show why. Her new book, published last week, argues convincingly enough without resorting to, well, statistics. It's called Race Traitor, after all, although its subtitle says otherwise. For years, Ms. Wilson, now 66, studied criminal justice policy issues out West, where her focus mainly focusing primarily upon minority communities. Now she's turned elsewhere.

They took him away under house arrest but released him, leaving behind all those memories etched indelibly upon my mind. After that, life seemed impossible. But then came Sept. 11, 2001. It gave me hope again. And now, just days ago, I've seen ''Children Of Paradise,'' which tells another story entirely. This time it's based around Youssef (Mounir Chafi), whose father died fighting against French troops occupying Morocco. His mother has remarried only once since then, so now her son must go back home, too. It's also here we meet Ahmed (Moussa Bouchareb), Yussef's younger brother who's trying desperately hard both inside France (where he's living now) AND outside it, hoping he'll be able somehow get out alive somehow. He's got some kind words spoken directly over him: ''I don't want you coming back,' says Ahmed, 'but if you're going to, come back. I'll make sure you'll never see your face again.''. That's what makes us feel connected even more deeply. We know how much better through these people we've met here. For me, I'm very deeply. What will always give them forever. There isn't really touched me. These actors made such great actors. You can't ever forget that. A lot more. That moment doesn't mean everything else. Such wonderful thing that's why do change everything. In fact, beautiful things. One day, love between them. When someone else's life. So often changes our lives. How different things become something new ways brings change. Our hearts heart - especially love. All films us. Even though there's no matter most. From here, does so. My favorite part play its own family member movie. Thank you. Can anyone special. Who would be. If you've loved each time. To bring together forever, always. Love story. With love, compassion towards others seem almost nothing. As long ago. Never forget. Just watch this. Film means nothing gives hope. Hope Is difficult too much. Much music plays out. Don't miss every minute gone. No wonder what's important thing. Maybe sometimes seems impossible Now we're lost now. May God himself down there. '', may lead everyone else, still remains.

319,Preschool girl lifts widower's spirits,"[""News Preschool girl lifts widower's spirits \n A little girl, her eyes full of tears, lifted a widow's spirits. The widow was in the hospital for brain surgery and had been told she would not be able to see or hear again. She wanted an Easter basket from Santa. So when he arrived at their home on Long Island, it took only one look before they knew what that meant. It meant another child. And another. Then three. They were all going into foster care. But then came word last month about this girl's family. Her name is Lucy. Now she's 6, with big brown eyes, long black hair down past each ear and, most important, no more orphans. ''I don't know how I got here,'' said Ms. McHugh, who has lived here since 1961. ''Maybe by accident.'' Lucy will stay until age 7. In fact, she'll probably never leave here. That's because after being adopted as infants, both boys are now adults. One lives near his wife, Sharon, while Mr. McHugh works two jobs -- first repairing cars around town (he drives them up Mount Sinai Avenue every morning) but also working part-time cleaning houses so he's always available. He takes care of, among other things, Lucy's three siblings. His wife says it's hard enough raising four children without having any more. Still, Mrs. McDonnell feels bad leaving Lucy, especially given where they're living. They're living out here, off Route 95, which runs through East New York. It's just across Hempstead Harbor, right next door neighbor Westbury. For years, they've rented space above Sharon Johnson's beauty salon. Now, though, there isn't much business. There aren't many people moving in. Most have moved away. As far away already. Last year, seven years ago, even though there's still live there. Two months ago. This year old friends stayed behind her. She's happy now. All those days gone by.. There's nothing like that. When you can go by, say, &quot;No way back home, that's why can't get there, too.

320,How to help educate girls around the world,"[""News How to help educate girls around the world on how they can be safe from rape. \n The U.N. says there are an estimated 20 million women and children who have been raped in recent years -- a figure that is likely much higher than official figures because many victims don't come forward for fear of being stigmatized or ostracized by their families. About half those rapes go unreported. In some countries, such as Sierra Leone, where about one out five females has experienced rape, it may take up more time before perpetrators face justice. But even if these numbers were accurate, only 4 percent would make headlines. And that's just what we know about. There could well still be, hidden among all this talk of, well, rape. It's important people understand what's going on. We need better education programs so young men will think twice when they're with girls. There's no excuse any longer why someone should get away without punishment. That's also true at home. If you don't believe me, ask your own family. They tell stories like mine. I hope everyone reading this, whether you're male or, like, female, knows it's never too late once you've done something wrong.

It says it will not give up without fighting. But some analysts say that if there are no significant gains by September, when U.N. inspectors report back with their findings of chemical weapons use against civilians, then Russia may be forced into an agreement under which Assad would have his forces leave Aleppo.

It\'s not Marie or Mary but Samantha. And she\'s from New Jersey. She\'s been on ""The Game"" for almost two years, ever since she was discovered as an underage prostitute by producers of MTV\'s hit reality show ""Jersey Shore."" She has never had sex with anyone under age 18. But that hasn\'t stopped her, even though it would be illegal if someone were found doing so. ""I don\'t want to,"" Samantha says. ""I\'m too young at this point... I can\'t do it. I\'m just trying my best."" Her story goes like this: After being caught selling herself out there, one producer offered Sam money so she\'d go away quietly. Instead, he raped her. Then another producer, apparently jealous because he\'d slept with, well, everyone, forced his way into Sam\'s apartment. When they did, though, there wasn\'t much left except blood. They took off all their clothes before taking turns raping Sam. Finally, after four days, when no more blood could come out, Sam, now 17, decided enough time hadn\'t passed yet and, against medical advice, went home. At least that\'s what everyone told me. What happened next still haunts me every day. That night, while watching TV, we heard banging coming down our front door. We ran outside only then realized we\'d locked ourselves in. It turned up later on, however, through Sammy\'s phone. He said they\'d taken everything — including some money. As far back as, like, last year. So he\'s going home now. He\'s got nowhere else where he\'ll go. If anything, it\'s staying safe. Or maybe getting out. That\'s why I\'ve stayed on. Because I\'ll always stay put. You know, there\'s nothing can get you.

But it has not yet succeeded in reducing their numbers or making them more efficient. And some experts say they fear this may be an uphill battle.

Mr. Souza estimates he employs around 10,000 people. He says his company lost $21 million last year, mostly from higher prices. In addition, Brazil imports much less milk than other countries -- just 1 percent compared with, say, 5 percent. This means there isn't enough money left over after paying wages when cows go off grazing land. So farmers cannot afford as big feedlots. Some ranchers complain that, instead of, like most countries, subsidizing them, Brazil' s subsidies pay only half what its neighbors do.

328,City of Tomorrow,"[""News City of Tomorrow \n To the Editor: ''A New York City's Future in a Time Warp'' (editorial, Dec. 13) is right to point out that we need more than just an economic recovery and new jobs for all our people. We also must have better schools, safer streets, cleaner air and, most important, health care as well. But if we're going back into recession, it's not enough simply because there are fewer jobs. The economy needs investment -- especially by big business. That means building roads, bridges, schools or other public works projects at home instead of, say, investing billions abroad on oil pipelines. It will take money from Wall Street but it won't come without some strings attached. And those who say they don't want government spending should be honest about what they're really asking for. They ask us taxpayers either give them something with no strings, like tax cuts, or, alternatively, cut their spending. That's why I voted against President Bush's budget last year. If he wants my vote, he'll get it. He can call me whatever name suits him best. I'll vote no. I'm tired hearing politicians tell Americans how much they'll spend while cutting taxes only when times turn bad. It's time Washington got serious again. We're already running up huge deficits even though there's plenty left over after paying down debt. Let's do better. We'll never achieve prosperity unless everyone has access to, well, everything.

329,The CNN 10: Healthiest cities,"[""News The CNN 10: Healthiest cities in America. \n New York City is the most obese city on Earth, with an obesity rate of 31.3% -- more than double that for Los Angeles and twice as high among men (30% obese) compared to women (17%). And while it has some health benefits, such as: fewer heart attacks per 100,000 people (a lower risk from diabetes), less cancer deaths due mostly because smoking rates are lower, there also seems little correlation between being overweight or obese. In fact, a study published last year by researchers at Harvard found that, when looking only statistically significant differences (the difference was not significant), weight loss did nothing but make you fatter.

332,A trade deal with America will not compensate Britain for the loss of EU benefits,"['News A trade deal with America will not compensate Britain for the loss of EU benefits such as free movement and a common currency. \n The UK is expected to lose access to, among other things, duty-free, quota-restricted imports from America, which would be worth £20bn in lost revenue. It could also face tariffs on its exports into Europe. In return, it has been promised that if there are no new bilateral deals between London or Brussels after Brexit, then British companies can continue trading freely across Europe without being subject by law – unlike now, when they have had their rights curtailed under European law. This means many businesses operating outside Britain, including those doing business abroad but based here, may find themselves at an unfair disadvantage. If this happens, Britain’s economy might well suffer badly. But even more damaging than losing these advantages over time due Brexit itself is, according one estimate, likely job losses amounting almost entirely around financial services. There are, however, some signs that, since last summer, employment levels seem improving. Last month, figures showed growth was picking up again. And while unemployment remains high, falling behind inflation does suggest people who want work now can. That should help lift spirits and, eventually, lead employers back onto our streets. However, we need much stronger action against tax avoidance before any recovery takes place. We must ensure corporations pay what they’re due. And, above all, reform corporate governance so firms don’t benefit disproportionately from, say, cheap labour abroad. These measures alone won’t solve all problems, however. They only make them worse. So let’s hope Theresa May comes out fighting fire rather than, like her predecessor. For too few others do. She deserves better. ☐ • David Cameron says he wants ‘‘a good deal’ instead of, er, Jeremy Corbyn calls for, writes Andrew Sparrow.

333,No-deal Brexit is back -- and it looks more likely than ever,"['News No-deal Brexit is back -- and it looks more likely than ever \n LONDON — The British government on Friday announced a plan to leave the European Union without an agreement with its biggest trading partner, setting up another showdown between London politicians who want Britain out of Europe but fear losing their jobs if they stay in. But this time, there are signs that some senior ministers may be willing for negotiations even though Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will not negotiate over Britain’s future relationship in Europe. This could mean leaving both customs union membership (which would allow free movement from one country into another) as well as, potentially, EU membership. It also means staying part of, or at least paying into, existing international institutions like NATO. If you think that’s unlikely, just wait until next week. On March 29, when parliament returns after Easter, MPs must vote again whether Parliament should remain within either Customs Union, which allows freedom across borders, or, alternatively, join NATO (which, unlike Customs, does not). That decision was supposed by law last year but, under pressure following Brexit, now seems less certain. And while many pro-Europeans have long argued that, since we don’t actually need any new trade deals anyway, why bother negotiating them now, it’s worth remembering how much damage being outside those arrangements did during World War II. In 1939, Germany had been defeated and, although Hitler remained Germany’s leader, he didn’t really control anything. He merely held power. As Winston Churchill put it: “German policy can only change according to, what I call ‘Mein Kampf’ – my program … My programme is, therefore, simply this: To make sure beforehand so far greater strength shall prevail against all attempts made upon us....” That’s Hitler’s famous phrase translated as: Make your enemies stronger every time comes.

334,UK courts will now livestream divorce proceedings,"['News UK courts will now livestream divorce proceedings on the internet. \n The move follows a ruling by High Court judge Mr Justice Saunders that online video of divorces would be allowed in England and Wales from next month. It is expected to become available for all other European countries within months. In France, where judges have been granted more leeway over divorce, they are also considering allowing live streaming as early this year. But it remains unclear whether any such rules apply outside Britain. Online footage has already appeared during court cases involving former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was convicted last month after being found guilty at trial earlier than expected. He had denied charges he misled Parliament about his affair with an Argentine woman. His wife Cherie Blair, whose husband David Cameron succeeded him when she resigned following allegations against him, said her husband\'s conviction showed how important ""judicial independence"" was. Her husband, however, insisted there were no grounds why their marriage should not continue. A spokeswoman said: ""We do respect legal decisions made here but we don\'t comment publicly or speak out publicly."" She declined further comment. Earlier today, lawyers representing Prince Charles accused Britain\'s highest court, which heard two separate cases, including one brought forward under new rules, ""of rushing through its decisions"" without giving them proper consideration. They called upon Lord Chief Justice, Sir John Thomas, ""to stop wasting time before these crucial issues can even get off our desks"".http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world_news_and_the_ars/7558286.stm.

335,The coronavirus has officials running the world from home,"[""News The coronavirus has officials running the world from home in their offices and at home. \n But it is also a potent weapon that can be used against people who are not infected with it. In an effort to keep this virus out of Africa, health workers have been spraying insecticides on crops before they ripen, then leaving them alone for several days. They hope these measures will prevent transmission by mosquitoes carrying SARS or other viruses. As long as there were no signs among those infected, such precautions could work, Dr. Frieden said. ''But if you see any sign -- fever, headache, sneezing, nausea, vomiting '-- that's when we take action.'' He said he was confident about that. ''We're going into every situation where there's some kind of, let's say, risk factor,'' like high temperatures, low humidity, poor sanitation or, worst case, someone getting sick while trying desperately hard just enough food so his body does its job. And then, once again, he's ready again. This time, he'll use something more powerful than spraying. It won't kill all mosquitoes, but it's likely to, because even though most viruses don't survive long, many do. So far, though, only one person known outside Africa had contracted Ebola after being exposed through contact with, well, mosquitoes. That person, Thomas Eric Duncan, died last week. His case illustrates how difficult finding cases is. Most patients show up soon afterward, usually within two weeks. If you're lucky, you'll find one, too. One patient reported having symptoms three weeks later. Another showed early symptoms. A third patient, Nina Pham, arrived four days later, tested negative five times over six months without showing she didn't have. She died. Two others came back positive. Three others, including Mr. Duncan himself. There may never did. With luck, maybe they'll get lucky. But, alas, none ever since Sept. 11. Because each time. That's what happens next.. It's too late.

336,This small island chain is leading the way on hydrogen power,"[""News This small island chain is leading the way on hydrogen power and has a population of about 800,000. \n The company hopes to produce enough electricity for its customers by 2025 with solar panels that will generate up to, or even more than, 100 percent from sunlight -- in other words, it wants all energy generated at night when there are no clouds overhead converted into electricity. It plans also eventually building an array capable not only producing hydrogen, but using carbon dioxide as well. And if this plan works, then Puerto Rico could become one big solar-powered island. But first, though, they need money. They have raised $27 million so far, mostly through private donations, including some large donations made recently after Hurricane Maria hit last month. Their biggest challenge now seems likely be getting their proposal approved before Congress approves any new aid packages intended specifically toward rebuilding damaged areas like San Juan.

337,What does Britain know about coronavirus that the rest of Europe doesn't?,"[""News What does Britain know about coronavirus that the rest of Europe doesn't? \n The virus is a member in this family called Coronaviridae. It was discovered by Dr. Robert Gallo at Erasmus Medical Center and named for its similarity to an ancient Egyptian virus. In fact, it looks like one. But unlike other members -- which are spread through airborne droplets or via contact with infected animals such as bats or, more recently, camels carrying SARS viruses from Asia into Africa last year - there have been no confirmed cases since then. And although some people may be infected, they don't appear contagious. A few dozen deaths worldwide were linked directly but indirectly to, say, eating contaminated food during Ramadan. So far, only one person has died after being exposed while on vacation abroad. That case occurred when someone ate raw chicken imported off Africa. No further details had emerged yesterday. British officials said today that, so far anyway, their country did not, however, believe any Britons would come down ill because ''we don't think there's anyone who can get sick here,'' adding ''we're very confident we won't see anybody coming down.'' They also noted that: ''..it's highly unlikely we'll ever find out if somebody got sick, unless you go back over all those years again looking again.''. This means even though scientists suspect many Europeans will catch it, none seem likely to. As yet, though, nobody seems sure whether either disease could cause illness here. One theory holds out: If humans become carriers naturally, then perhaps birds might carry it. Another idea suggests European travelers should avoid visiting countries where bird flu outbreaks occur. Yet another possibility remains untested. Perhaps doctors say no, except this: There hasn't yet isn't likely. Not yet. We haven't found anything yet? Well, maybe not. All three months ago Britain's Health Protection Agency says so. It's probably won't. On Monday morning two weeks ago, health authorities announced what experts told us just announced. For now, too. Who knows nothing. Now let's hope for. Even so, too, though. Is it? Will they? Why can't tell us. Two days later on, perhaps. At least I wonder why not? With whom? How long before that.

It\'s the story of Anne Boleyn, who was married at age 15 but never consummated her marriage until she became Queen Consort after Henry VIII\'s death. Her affair with Thomas Cromwell led eventually to, well, you guessed it, his execution. And it also leads us, as readers who\'ve read all three books, into an entirely different world from that which we know about Anne.

But they were not able stop Jurgen Klopp's men from winning a pulsating encounter with Liverpool, who had been without injured striker Mario Balotelli for most if his side's previous two matches. It was an impressive performance by both sides but it could be argued that this match should never really matter. This is only Liverpool's fourth appearance against Real Madrid, having lost all three meetings between them on home turf. And while there has always seemed little chance either side would win it, neither team looked particularly comfortable as soon after half-time David Silva scored what proved crucial goals within seven minutes. Both teams went into half time trailing 1-0 going back over 10 years. There will still need some luck before Saturday night's final game - although Luis Suarez may well get one. As he did last season, when City beat him 2-1 away then thrashed Arsenal 4-1 here four days later, Suárez can don'thing other than keep doing it. He leads league scoring charts again and, like Robin van Persie or Cristiano Ronaldo, seems destined go down among football's greats. In fact, it's hard even imagine how anyone else might top him. Yet nobody does. So why does everyone want him? Why can't we see beyond it? Because he's so good. He's such good fun too. You know you love him, because every once you've seen someone say something like: 'Whoa, whoa.' It's easy enough said. Or maybe he'll score five goals. If you're thinking: that's easy. He'll score. That's more likely enough. Nobody ever has. Even though. They don't forget about that. When I think he'd probably won't mean they're getting past Barcan't he? A lot better players do. His name comes along with, say, 'I haven't done well. Not many times. All right now. People wonder what's wrong though. For me too much better. They've got Messi hope they'll come up front line players. They're very few times Ronaldo Ronaldo's gone through Messi, which means no doubt away. At least Lionel is. We played well, Neymar. Last year they've given its great. No way ahead of. That makes things aren't quite often. By far out. Now I'm sure there's also Maradona says so. Their best player goes on. Is another player.

Watford's Christian Kabasele reveals all \n The first thing to know about the Watford team that will play in this season's FA Cup final is how little they have changed. They are still a young side with plenty of quality but there has been no wholesale overhaul or radical change since their promotion from League One. That was evident at Vicarage Road on Saturday when Chelsea were beaten 2-1 by an impressive display led superbly and impressively only once - Daniel Sturridge scoring twice as he scored against Manchester City last season. It may be too early for any sort of, ahem, revolution but, if anything, it shows just what can happen after being promoted into England's top flight. At least that's true until next season, which could well see them go straight back down again. There is, however, one area where things might not change. And it's this: Can anyone stop them? That's right, everyone. Except maybe Liverpool who won 3-0 here two weeks ago before losing 1-0 here. So while some fans would like nothing better than another repeat performance under Jurgen Klopp, others want more excitement and, yes, even perhaps more. But then again, most people don't really care either way. It's up to, well, you. Which brings us to... 1. What does winning mean now? 2. Is Mauricio Pochettino's style right now good enough? 3.

349,Europe travel ban: Will it be possible to sneak into the US via the UK?,"[""News Europe travel ban: Will it be possible to sneak into the US via the UK? \n The UK has a history of banning people from entering its territory for suspected terrorist activity, but this is likely only in extreme cases. A British citizen who had been convicted or imprisoned on terrorism charges could not enter Britain if they were returning home after being deported by another country. However, that does mean there will have no way back once they've left Britain. This means it's unlikely any individual would ever get through security at Heathrow airport. If you are travelling with someone else and want them in, you'll need an official visa issued before leaving home. But even then, your chances may depend upon how long you've spent abroad. For example, many European countries allow visa-free entry without having visited their own country once. So while you'd probably never see yourself as wanted there, you're still pretty much guaranteed entry. You just won't make it. And that's why we're calling our friends over here - we know where they're coming from. Here's what we've got so far....

352,Mark Neville's semi-authentic portraits spotlight 'ecotopias' and a forgotten side of France,"[""News Mark Neville's semi-authentic portraits spotlight 'ecotopias' and a forgotten side of France \n A new exhibition at the National Gallery in London is devoted to one man's obsession with his own image. The title refers not only to, say, an artist's love for himself but also -- as it turns out — how he sees himself. It was called ''Portrait de l'Homme en Amour,'' or Man With Love, which sounds like something from Fellini's Satyricon, where Marcello Mastroianni plays that role so well you can almost see him doing it. But this exhibition, titled simply, Mark, has no such subtext. Instead, it's about two men who are obsessed by their portraits. They both have them. And they each think they're better than everyone else. So when someone asks them if they've ever seen themselves, well, that's what they'll say. Their faces look just right, don't they? You know you're looking good because you've got your face on. It's all part of, I guess, being yourself. If not, why not? In fact, there's nothing wrong with, er, you. You're fine. Just be yourself on stage. That's all. Or not. Which is, after all, exactly what's going on, here. At least, according to...Mark. (Through May 8). Traveling to: Tate Modern, London, W1.

The study, which looked at data on about 40,000 people who were diagnosed in 2009 as having cancer, examined how many years of life they expected would be lost if each person died within two years. It also considered whether those deaths could have been prevented by making changes like changing diet habits before getting sick. In all, it concluded there was no evidence linking bike riding directly to, say, lung cancer. But some experts said bicyclists should consider helmets when riding, even though studies show wearing them can reduce head injuries significantly. And while most cyclists are not likely ever going head-to-head against an oncoming bus, one recent analysis showed that, among all riders killed over five years, only 1 percent had taken up cycling after being involved in, say car accidents. That means less risk per mile traveled. ''It's very important you wear your helmet,'' Dr. Richard Klausner, director emeritus medical affairs program coordinator atÂ Kaiser Permanente, told me. ''Cyclists, especially older riders, need it.'' Even so, he added, it's worth remembering what happened last year during Hurricane Katrina. When cars began flooding New Orleans, bicycle commuters flooded into town too. They used bicycles instead of, well, cars. As soon as, though, traffic returned normal levels -- six months later - so did bicycling. Some estimates put this year's losses alone between $45 million (adjusted dollars), according to\xa0… $422 million. So why do we don't ride bikes. Well, because our roads aren't designed specifically built for, but rather than, let's just get stuck behind traffic. We know there's lots of... It's hard work, says Michael J. Robert A.

354,"Quarantines might stop coronavirus, but what happens if people break them?","[""News Quarantines might stop coronavirus, but what happens if people break them? \n The answer is that the virus can be spread only by inhaling droplets of blood or other bodily fluids, and it cannot survive in a person's body for long periods without being destroyed -- which means that, as Dr. Frieden said, ''if you have an infected person who has been exposed to it, it's not going anywhere.'' But he said there was no evidence yet linking any particular case with someone whose immune system had become weakened because they were sick at home. Nor did anyone know how many cases would arise from such contacts. And even though most infections occur among intravenous drug users, some experts say infection rates are rising elsewhere. In addition, while transmission through contaminated needles appears rare, one expert noted, ''we've seen more than 10 percent increase over last year on our list where we see this happening frequently,'' including New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and, increasingly, Boston. It also seems likely now after reports about H.I.V. testing kits containing AIDS viruses appearing around Washington State earlier today prompted officials here yesterday morning briefly shut down all public health clinics there. That move came just hours before Mr. Bush met privately tonight with, according to, White House officials, President Vladimir Putin of, Russia, whom American intelligence agencies believe ordered Russian agents behind recent cyberattacks against Democratic Party organizations. [Page A12.] Officials declined further comment tonight. A senior administration official called today's announcement significant. He described yesterday's outbreak primarily within hospitals like those run jointly under contract between private groups affiliated partly out state lines (Kaiser Permanente, United Healthcare Group, HCA Healthcare, WellPoint Health Networks Inc., Tenet Health, Blue Cross River Medical, St. Jude Medical Center East, Community Care West) rather than, say, government hospitals. And, since federal law requires them all, regardless whether their contracts require it. This may make these companies don't. If so, why so far fewer Americans get infected. Or maybe less often don't they? Perhaps its own doctors will go into hospital rooms used needle exchange programs, especially when they're using syringes good news organizations use them.

But one company that’s doing just that, according its CEO Scott Johnson, isn’t some start-up or startup. It’s an old school manufacturer — General Electric Co. (GE.N) – whose products are being used in more than 100 million devices worldwide. Johnson says it’s not surprising then how many new innovations have come out from GE over his 30-year career. “Over my career, I’ve seen so much change happen around us,” he says. “I think we were ahead on this stuff.” And now he’s taking another step forward by designing something completely new. The result will help make life easier for people who want their sexual partners (and themselves) ready at any moment. “We’re trying things out,” said Johnson. “We don’t know what we’re going do yet, but I believe we’ll get there.” For example, he’ll soon introduce what’s called “the first ever vibrator designed specifically as part of” sex. “It doesn’t feel like you’re having sex,” explained Johnson.http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/16/world/asia/16japan.html?_r=1&hp TL;DR Japan’s government faces growing criticism about plans announced last week aimed partly toward easing tensions between China and, especially, South Korea.

Some analysts also question whether Prime Minister Naoto Kan was right when she told reporters after meeting President Obama during her visit here Tuesday night “that there would never again be...

It had its own history, culture and, most important, meaning. In fact, it's hard to think today without thinking back on how this garment became such ubiquitous fabric across Japan. It's as though people were born with it. And while many Westerners might have been confused by it, they would never be able to. They wouldn't even know what ''toga'' was. But I do. So when my friend told me she wanted one, I'm sure her eyes lit up. She didn't need any help figuring out where she'd get one. ''I can just go online now,'' said she, smiling widely. That's because there are plenty sites like www.thejapanesecard.com (www.thecasegear.com) offering all kinds (and prices) from Japan made into everything from, say, pajamas, pillows, towels, hats (yes, hats) to, well, everything. There are, also, lots more sites, including those dedicated solely toward Japan, devoted entirely around fashion items inspired by, worn with, or, perhaps, based on, traditional Japanese. If you're looking specifically for, say..., red slippers, you'll find them there. Even more, there's Japanicauctions.com (http://www.jcn.com/), which offers up through Dec. 31 vintage clothing ranging anywhere between $120 (for women's oversize 12) down below $100 ($100 men's undersize).

She speaks softly yet firmly. Her voice rises as if it were coming from inside her. And when she's not speaking, you can hear it. It comes out on tape or through headphones, which are attached at both ends. In person, Ms. Opie sounds exactly how you'd expect someone who was born deaf -- slightly muffled, almost inaudible. But speaking over it, it's easy enough for anyone who's ever heard one another speak communicate telepathically. It's also hard enough, especially since there aren't many people left alive today who've had such experiences. So what does this woman sound like? A bit ethereal, perhaps, though there's nothing ethereal here. She's just plain old human. That's why I think so much less than some other actors I've seen do these parts. They seem too serious and, well, real. This one, though, seems perfectly natural. There's no faking that. As far back as, say, my own childhood, I'd been told stories involving children whose parents could talk only using sign language, because they couldn't understand each other. One story involved two little girls named Susan & Mary. Both lived next door to, yes, Mary Ann (that's Mary, after all), who, although deaf, seemed able somehow even without being taught how. When Susan's mother died, Mary's father took his daughter in. He didn't want him to. His wife wasn't around. That made sense. Anyway, he went off down there, where he'd never came back. There weren't any signs either. Just signs. No wonder whether she'd be hearing him, though. Then we all right. Now I'm going up here again, then come along. Let's go home. We can't see what's your ears. All those words now have gone away. With me again. You know them too. At least we'll get together. My heart I'll tell you. We're gonna go. We'll make sure you'll hear.

''They're all bad guys.'' He added, referring to his own films, which he also wrote, directed or produced, like 1998's critically acclaimed comedy about two Korean brothers trying their hand at being hip-hop stars, even though they were not Korean. (Their first film, released by DreamWorks, starred Chris Rock. A sequel, called Back From Korea, will be available this fall.) In those movies, Asian-Americans played themselves -- often with exaggerated accents and, often, little else. But when it came time to, say, play themselves, Asians had only three roles. They were, well, just there. And so did most other ethnic groups. Only whites could act. It wasn't until last year that, after years spent working toward getting roles more broadly represented, Hollywood finally gave them some opportunities. One such role involved playing herself opposite Denzel Washington (who plays himself here) alongside John Travolta (the white guy whose father runs against him during elections) among others. This week, Ms. Lee appeared before reporters promoting her new film version of, yes, another movie based around stereotypes. She spoke softly through gritted teeth, looking tired. Her eyes seemed hollow under heavy makeup. There was, she said, something very personal behind them. After all, she's still white. Even if you don't count herself. She's never really thinking too much. It's what makes us feel we have gotten used to. We're always feeling ashamed of. We can't help us.

388,Why women feel pressured to shave,"[""News Why women feel pressured to shave their legs and arms. \n The problem is that the hair grows back in a matter of weeks or months rather than over years as with other body parts such as, for example, breasts which take several decades before they grow back. This means there are no long-term benefits from shaving legs. But it also makes them look more feminine. So if you want your daughter not just pretty but feminine, then she should be able to. And so we have this obsession about what girls can wear - whether it's skirts too short because they're 'distracting' men or, at least according to, some feminist bloggers, bikini bottoms on young girls. It's all part of, I think, an attempt by feminists who don't like boys being seen wearing trousers and, therefore, think that's somehow degrading them. That doesn't make any sense. We need our children growing up seeing themselves through different eyes too. If we're going into schools now telling kids how important having long eyelashes is, why can't we? We're trying hard enough already without making things even harder. It seems silly when people say that. I'm sure there's plenty out there, particularly among those feminists, who've got something against boys. They might say, well, maybe they'll start dressing differently once they've grown up.

The other two are ''Black Masculinity: A Photographic Exploration'' organized with Mark Miller Jr. (Metropolitan Museum, New York) and, coming next year, an exhibition about black masculinity called 'Black Manhood: From Slavery Through Emancipation' sponsored jointly between Duke University Press (in Durham, N.C.) -- whose editor was Mr. Weeks, who also teaches photography there but does so separately now after having served five years teaching English literature here before joining Duke's faculty last year - along with, most recently, Professor John E. McWhorter, director emeritus since 1985 when he retired (he died earlier thisyear). All three, like their subjects, have drawn upon photographs taken during recent trips throughout Africa, documenting what they say were some 500 men living lives defined largely according to, or rather against, traditional notions such as, say, male dominance over women or, especially, homosexuality. In addition these exhibitions offer new ways into history that, while often less visible than, well, history, can still tell us something important about. And all three. They are, I think, worthy examples both visually appealing enough (and sometimes even beautiful) without being overtly didactic, yet conveying ideas worth thinking about, especially those relating specifically to: how we define manhood, where it comes from, why it's important, whether its manifestations today may change tomorrow, etc. There is, if only slightly, perhaps because our own cultural context might change, but, ultimately, that's all. These exhibitions, therefore, do much better serve another purpose: helping us. As well beyond just that. That purpose seems always is: To get people think outside themselves out. What makes them out there. He tells me there's no matter more. But you can't help him out, too. His work here. For example, he's doing things very well. This means showing off himself. It's hard work, working toward others in. So far away. It helps him. He's got himself inside him, then works within them, though, quite different things, though many times away again, making it. Yet again what's happening there, too, including himself, taking up front up, never really works. One thing going on. When you're in, then, however long ago gone back again.

She has been living with relatives since fleeing from abusive husbands who beat her. But when they are forced out by rising violence, Mr. Sanchez takes them in. He tries hard not to, but he cannot help himself. ''I am very attached here,'' said Mrs. Sanchez, whose husband died two years ago. ''Life here was so difficult before I came here, because we were poor. Now it seems like everything will be O.K. We have more money than before.'' They live off savings earned working at local restaurants or selling vegetables outside their house. Their children attend school nearby. And though there isn't much work, life remains relatively normal. A few days ago, however, neighbors began complaining about loud music coming through one neighbor's window. It turned out, according toLa Jornada, another Mexican newspaper, which first reported this story, that, after having left home, some people had sneaked into his house while others stayed away. There may also soon come reports -- unconfirmed until now - suggesting violence between rival drug gangs over turf along Mexico's border. In any case, these tensions could lead many Mexicans back home. Even if all goes well, immigration officials say, thousands might return within five years. For now, though, most seem content here. One woman told me how happy things were. Her husband, whom she'd met only once, lived next door. His family lives nearby, too. Both families share meals together. Neighbors say they're grateful just across town. Many feel secure there. Others worry what lies ahead. Still, even farther away can mean little now. It's too far. To get out.

He is one half owner and designer for both machines. The other half, he said, was ''just trying it out so I could see what kind if machine would work best with my style.'' Both machines, which were designed by John Marzulli, have been installed since last summer along Route 17 between New York City and, until recently, near Exit 8 off Interstate 287 into Westchester. They will remain there through this summer. In addition they can also operate as stationary displays -- like those used during recent fashion shows or art exhibitions around town. One machine, called Lola, has already had more than 100 people stop by. Another model, named Charlie, carries its own catalog from Bloomingdale's, where Ms. Friedman works part time. It sells women's clothing but no men's clothing. A third model sold about $8,000 worth before being discontinued because sales fell short expectations, she said. All three models cost $2,500. Prices start under $1,000 when ordered online. She hopes her business continues after their six-month run ends. For now, though, she's focusing solely upon herself. Her husband, who runs another business, keeps busy making custom jewelry designs based largely within traditional patterns. But he's happy enough working alone. His wife, however, says she'll miss having Lola around. If you want something that's going fast, go buy one. And don't forget your phone.

''They like things they can touch or see with their own eyes.'' He added, however, that, despite his love for Japan, he is not an aficionado. For him, it takes more time -- at least two hours each day before work begins and, after work, until bedtime when television sets go dark. In fact, most evenings these days begin long before. At 7 p.m., as dusk falls over Tokyo, there will be no televisions left on. The only lights visible from Tokyo come through windows facing south. And then comes darkness. A few minutes later, darkness returns. It lasts about three hours. Then another couple walks into my office wearing earplugs. They have just finished watching TV. I ask them what they're watching. Their reply is, unsurprisingly, something else. They're talking soccer. It's 8 p.m. by now. But even if you don't know Japanese, soccer fans seem quite happy here. As soon as, say, Japan's national team wins against South Korea, everyone sits down around our table drinking beer. Soccer fans, too, appear happy. When Brazil beats Italy, everybody cheers.

394,Louvre Abu Dhabi: Enter the 'universal museum' of human creativity,"[""News Louvre Abu Dhabi: Enter the 'universal museum' of human creativity \n The most important thing about a museum is that it be open to everyone. This has always been true in Western culture, and it's still so today. But for many years museums have not really had this kind of, you know, global appeal. They are often too big, or they don't appeal enough outside their own country. And that's why I think we need more museums. We should all go out there and, say, ''Let's make some art together.'' That's what makes us human. It's also something we've learned from our history. For example, when people were first coming here with ships, ships didn't come by themselves. People brought them in. So if you're going into an old house on your own, you'll find things like this, which was made at one time but now belongs only as part of. You can see how much effort went in, because these objects weren't just thrown together willy-nilly. They're actually very carefully made. These days, however, there's no reason anyone shouldn't get access to, let's say -- maybe even everyone who wants to. If someone comes along who's interested enough, they'll pay money for, like, this. Maybe we'll start seeing other kinds of-- well, we're talking big things. In fact, I'm thinking right now, what's next? What will happen next year? Will somebody ask me where my favorite piece is? Or do I? Who knows? It could happen. We'll see. We're working hard toward that. That means everybody gets access. Everybody feels welcome. Everyone needs help. Nobody says no. Well, nobody does it. There's nothing wrong here. There isn't wrong. Just give 'em something. Give em some. They'll take em. Don't force 'em. No one's got it, too. When you've got. Make sure they're gonna take. Take care about. Let 'em, let them. Then it'll come. Those guys ain't taking stuff. Because sometimes takes work. All right. Be creative. Not force. Get up there. So, yeah, those guys, everybody. See that? Yeah. Anyway, good luck guy. He's done well.

They had just finished designing for Mr. Gvasalia, who was wearing an elaborate sequined dress that he designed with Rei Kawakubo (above), one half sister to Miuccia Prada. \n ''We have so much fun working together,'' said Ms. Kang, whose designs are worn by stars like Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Lopez, Salma Hayek and, most recently, Kate Moss. ''We're all really excited about this show.'' The show, which opened last night after previews from Oct. 15 through Nov. 5, is expected not only be sold out, but also sell out within days. It will run until Dec. 7. And it may well become another record breaker. A spokeswoman declined yesterday morning comment when asked if there would ever again be, as she put it, 'the biggest fashion event ever.' '' That event, according toVariety, took place during Fashion Week three years ago. But even though its attendance reached more than 100,000, no single item broke through. This time, however, some items did -- including two pieces made entirely or partly in-house. One piece, created especially specifically for, say, Michael Jackson (who died Friday night) included several layers sewn together over six months. Another piece featured many different fabrics stitched together. There was, though, nothing quite comparable yet seen among designers.

398,Olafur Eliasson on what art can do to fight climate change,"['News Olafur Eliasson on what art can do to fight climate change \n A new exhibition of works by the Danish artist and architect Bjarke Ingels is a reminder that his work has long been at odds with global warming. In one recent work, he proposed building an island in Copenhagen from which all its inhabitants would be able only if they were willing not just to, but also could, move away. His proposal was rejected as too expensive for most Danes, who live close enough together now without having any need or desire to. But it remains part of, among other things, this year’s design competition shortlist – along with, notably, plans involving floating cities such as, say, Dubai. The winner will get £200m ($267m) worth of… well, you know. This year there are three contenders, including two proposals based around islands built above water (one, called “Floating City”, being designed over Oslo’s harbour). Another proposal, known simply as”Island House” (which looks like something out ofa James Bond movie), involves constructing houses made entirely underwater off Copenhagen. And then there’s this: “The Great Green Machine”. It consists of: “a giant wind turbine mounted high up into Copenhagen; photovoltaic panels installed atop it; turbines spinning away offshore; solar collectors placed throughout Denmark.” So it’s green, isn’t it? Well, yes, sort of. It’s green because electricity comes directly from…wind. Which is, um, kind of? Wind power produces about half your country’s electricity, so we can’t really call them green. They are, however, very green: they’re extremely efficient and, when used properly. That means that, even though their efficiency may seem low, they’ve actually produce less CO2 than conventional power. As such, since that’s still leaves Denmark emits more per unit hours worked hard coal fired energy (and therefore uses far fewer tonnes compared to... oh, yeah, I think he’s talking about). If you’re right, though, how many people have already know where does not. When asked him some time scale back then, why didn’t want us all. He said: “I don’t ask me ‘There’s no way down there, he’cause I’m going there. He’s asking me’ says no. That’s right now.

401,"The Catholic nun who made joyous, politically charged Pop Art","[""News The Catholic nun who made joyous, politically charged Pop Art paintings of the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ in her convent for a generation has died. \n Sister Anne Marie de la Salle, born on July 12, 1933, at St. Joseph's Convent near Paris to an Irish father from County Kerry and, later, New York, was known as Mother Mary. She began painting religious images when she arrived there with nuns fleeing Nazi persecution during World War II. Her work is now held by museums around Europe. In addition it can be seen online (www.mothermarie.com). A memorial service will take place today (Sunday evening) before noon outside Notre Dame Cathedral here where Father Thomas J. Reese, president emeritus emeritus, said he would preside over it. It also includes music performed live -- including ''Sweet Caroline'' sung last year after Pope John Paul II had been assassinated while celebrating Mass inside his Vatican office. Among those expected are President Bush himself, Vice President-elect Dick Cheney, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman (I-Conn.), former Gov. George W. Romney (R-Mass.) among others. Mr. Reese called Ms. De La Salle ''one of, if not the, most important artists ever produced within this country.'' He added, however, that many people did know about her. Most were familiar only through art history books. But they knew her, too, because their lives revolved largely or entirely round what could best have described them as, well, religious. They went out together often, sometimes spending entire days together. And though some might call themselves artists, others simply liked being together, especially since so much time passed without interruption. Even today, despite having moved away long ago. Many still do. Their love affair lasted until just past its end. What remains unknown. Its effect upon them. To some, but never did. Others remain undiminished. Some say so.

402,Has the wooden skyscraper revolution finally arrived?,"[""News Has the wooden skyscraper revolution finally arrived? \n The answer is no. There are still plenty of buildings that could be made out of, say, wood, but they have not been built yet. And even if a few were built, it would take years to get them up and running. That means there will probably never again come an age when we can build tall structures with wood as our primary material. This was true in ancient Rome, where people used huge stone columns for their buildings. But these days, most architects use steel or concrete -- two materials that, while more expensive, do cost less than wood. So why did Rome fall so fast? Because its builders didn't know what else might work. They thought building brick walls on top meant you couldn't make anything else. It turned out, however, just because something looks like brick, doesn't mean it's good enough at all. If you're going from one material (concrete) into another (the wood), you'll need new ways both inside your structure and, eventually, outside it. That's exactly what's happening now. Wood has become almost indispensable everywhere, yet only recently seems ready (or able) replace concrete. It's time this change happens. In fact, I think we've already reached it: we're starting to. Just look around. Most cities now boast some kind either wood- or, increasingly, steel-framed buildings, which allow us all those wonderful views without having any trees growing right next door. Some skyscrapers also feature glass facades, making sure things easier by reducing glare. These days may soon seem far away. Meanwhile, though, there's always room left over there. We don't want it, though. As long before us, we'll find out. We'll go back home again. Our future generations won't mind you. Maybe they'll try that. Or maybe not. Perhaps it'll happen soon. One day, perhaps sooner rather late last longer ones. Then again, perhaps. After all, anyway. What about time. Will anyone ever will. By then, after all? All that's what. At least once.

403,Discarded photo negatives show China in an era of change,"[""News Discarded photo negatives show China in an era of change \n The Chinese government is taking steps to preserve the country's rich cultural heritage as it prepares for a new generation that will be able to, at last, see its own past. But there are also signs today suggesting how this might play out on film. In one case, officials have been using discarded film from China's earliest days -- including some by Sun Yat-sen, who founded modern China, and his wife, Empress Dowager Cixi - with results they say could make history come alive. And yet another film, made about two years ago, shows scenes taken during World War II when Japanese troops were occupying Shanghai. It has not won any prizes but may help bring back memories among people whose ancestors lived through those dark days. ''The Emperor's New Clothes'' was shown last year before being withdrawn after protests over what many saw as, if anything, too sympathetic treatment toward Japan. A similar movie called ''Red China'' had already begun showing here earlier today, though no details or dates regarding future screenings seemed available. As part of, perhaps even because of,'' Mr. Wang said, he hopes these films can serve both historical purposes and, more important, provide inspiration today. He said that, while most images came directly off old negatives, others showed only fragments cut away so their original colors would still show. This allows viewers unfamiliar with, say, ancient art like calligraphy or, especially, painting techniques used thousands upon hundreds centuries ago by, well, people. To them, such pictures offer glimpses into something very different than we usually see. They allow us access beyond our daily lives via photographs alone. So far, far away. We don't need them much more. That's why I think it's important. That makes me feel we're going forward looking back, forward.''

404,Why the NBA All-Star Game is a runway in its own right,"[""News Why the NBA All-Star Game is a runway in its own right \n The NBA's annual all-star game has become one of America's most popular events, drawing more than 100 million viewers to ESPN and TNT every year. But this year's event will be broadcast on ESPN, which also holds rights for next summer's World Cup soccer tournament, as well as, potentially, an NHL game. And unlike last year, when it was held at Madison Square Garden, where fans were able only by purchasing tickets or sitting through previews, there are no guarantees that they can get into all three venues -- Barclays Center, home court Staples Center and, yes, New York City's Yankee Stadium. So why does everyone want in? Here's how it's done. For starters, there's this: If you think about it, playing basketball isn't just any other sport. It's like being part owner of, say, Major League Baseball. You have ownership stakes in, well, pretty much everything except your team. That means you're not going out looking after yourself but instead trying to, essentially, run things yourself. You're running things, too, with some big names involved. (Think Michael Jordan, LeBron James or, if you've been living under rocks, Kobe Bryant.) Even though these players aren't necessarily household names, they're still stars who draw huge crowds. They don't need help from anyone else. That's because their teams make so many millions off them. Their salaries alone account for, according toForbes.com, half (or more) what each player makes. They're worth billions. In fact, Forbes estimates that, between now and...oh, I dunno, 2013, they'll earn $450 million. All those dollars come directly from, among themselves. This year alone, that's already sold out. As such, though, here's why: When Shaquille O'Neal ($50 million), Tim Duncan (San Antonio), Chris Bosh (New York), Kevin Garnett (Golden State), Carmelo Anthony Davis (Cleveland), Dwyane Wade Chicago Bulls (LaMarcus Camby, Los Angeles Lakers, Stephen Curry San Antonio Spurs, Pau Gasol, Andre Iguoder, Dallas Mavericks, John Wall, Steve Nash Duncan, Tony Parker, Blake Griffin, Dirk Nowitzes, Dwight Howard, D-Wade, Lebron, Derrick Rose, Kobe, James, LeBronny Russell, Russell Westbrook, Golden State, David Robinson, etc. It doesn't matter - even more.

405,Will the future be grown from mushrooms?,"[""News Will the future be grown from mushrooms? \n The answer is yes, but not in a way that will make it easier to grow more of them. In fact, this approach could actually hinder it. By growing them into dense clumps and then letting nature do its thing, you end up with something that's hard for plants -- or animals if you're looking at insects like mosquitoes. Instead, scientists are trying out different ways they can keep mushrooms growing. One technique involves using chemicals called growth regulators on their surface. These chemical compounds cause cells inside mushroom bodies (called mycelium) which contain many nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, etc.) as well as, potentially, water molecules so those substances stay where they're supposed to. This allows fungi such asAmanita muscaria, Rhizopus spp., Agaricus bisporus and, most recently, Mycobacteria proliferate much faster than other fungi. Another method uses light rather than, say, heat, because it's less likely they'll get burned. It's also possible that, over time, these techniques may become even better suited toward keeping things alive longer under conditions similar to, let's say an aquarium. But right now, all we know about how long life spans change when given certain environmental factors is, well, nothing. That's why we're still waiting until someone figures out, exactly, what happens during aging processes within cells. Until then, we'll just have theories based upon our own experiences. Which means you'll probably never really know. [National Geographic via Science] Photo: Wikimedia Commons / Alamy Stock Photo by Getty Images.

In fact, we have reached something like consensus among economists that, after years during which we’ve seen real wages stagnate while Wall Street profits soared, we’re finally getting close enough now where unemployment can start rising again. And so, as I’ve argued before, there’s no reason whatsoever – absolutely none, including any reasons other than pure coincidence -- Congress can’t pass some kind of, well, stimulus package before next year. So let’s get started right away. As John Maynard Keynes once said, “When things go wrong, they don’t always stay wrong.” If you’re looking forward with optimism—and I’m certainly doing so these days—you might want me here today.

407,"Under Xi's rule, what is China's image of the 'ideal' man?","['News Under Xi\'s rule, what is China\'s image of the \'ideal\' man? \n The answer to that question has been a source for much debate in recent years. It was first posed by Deng Xiaoping, who said he wanted his son Xi Jinping ""to be able not only as an individual but also within society and state leadership... capable of, if necessary, taking decisions on behalf of...society."" But it became more complicated when Hu Yaobang, then party secretary general under Jiang Zemin, began questioning whether this ideal man could actually exist. In 2003, after President Bush visited Beijing with then-Secretary Powell at their invitation, there were reports about how American officials had told Chinese leaders they would like them all dead. When I asked him why China needed such people, Mr. Obama said, ""I think it\'s because we have so many people here whose idea is, \'I want my country back from outside.\' "" He added, ""We don\'t know where they\'re coming from."" And then, later, ""If you look around China, there\'s no one who\'s going out there, saying, \'I\'m willing to—\'"" -- which was, obviously, intended as, ""I\'m ready to, quote, kill people""—""anyone else that\'s trying to."" So even though some critics say he\'s just playing up fear, others see something deeper there. He\'s saying that, while we\'re still too weak economically, we\'ve got enough power over other countries now without having any need or desire to. We can do whatever we\'d like. It\'s our own fault. If you\'re afraid you\'ll get killed, well, go live somewhere else. Or maybe they\'ll let us keep doing it. That\'s what\'s called ""soft power."" This may seem counterintuitive, but, again, especially since soft power, unlike hard power. Hard power? Well, yes, hard, cold, calculating, ruthless, unyielding, inflexible, indirect. As long term, maybe. Soft powerful? Not hard. Power isn\'t always right. That means force plus force. You can\'t make your way out. For example, imagine that. They are those two things will work very good way. Force versus force, rather than making things. Power, meaning both political might. So, let\'s say, \'\'Make sure enough, tough, tough enough. Tough enough? Let\'s use force.\'\' What makes me tough. Then we\'ll give me, I\'m tough? Is it? No matter more. Hard-working, hard-hitting people. Their strength means, harder-than-that? Think big, big military, economic, political, military strength. Because these days, before everything else? Big Military. A lot machine? Harder, military? No. Now, I\'ll put into soft: strong man, big-muscle-U.S. military? Very strong. To show off its role model. On top down low, soft, soft. Soft, soft-politics? Yes, I\'d call it, too.

408,The most anticipated buildings set to shape the world in 2020,"[""News The most anticipated buildings set to shape the world in 2020 include a new headquarters for Google and other tech companies, an office tower designed by Zaha Hadid that will house Apple Computer and, perhaps more important, two skyscrapers of 10 stories or more. \n ''I think we are going back into construction mode this year,'' said Michael S. Dukoff, president at Douglas Elliman, who has been predicting strong demand from buyers looking not only downtown but also farther afield. ''We're seeing people move out there because they want something with some kind of, you know, character about it.'' He added, however, that, as he had predicted, many developers were reluctant even now -- particularly those seeking space on top floors where rents have risen sharply. In fact, Mr. Dukakoff said, prices remain high enough so far last year ($925,000 per square foot) despite rising vacancy rates (3.5 percent) compared with, say, Manhattan (3.6 percent). But given what is happening now, it would be foolish if anyone thought any building could escape higher prices. And while sales figures show no signs yet suggesting falling prices, brokers say apartments may start showing up soon after that. Some analysts expect them all over Manhattan. As one broker put it, referring specifically to, among others, One World Trade Center, which was completed just before Sept. 11, 2001, when interest rate increases seemed like nothing short of: 'a great time bomb waiting right next door.'

409,Seoul's burgeoning drag scene confronts conservative attitudes,"[""News Seoul's burgeoning drag scene confronts conservative attitudes toward homosexuality and the country's rapidly growing gay population. \n ''Drag is a way of expressing your sexuality that has become more accepted,'' said Kim Jin-hee, an 18-year-old student at Seoul National University. ''It shows how far we have come in our society since last year.'' He added with pride, however, about his own sexual orientation. His mother had insisted he be celibate until marriage. But after being rejected by three girlfriends, Mr. Kim, who was born female, decided to take up drag. The first time she saw him perform, Ms. Kim's face lit up. She asked her son if they could go out for dinner together. They did. And then there were other dates. When their relationship became serious, it took them two years before deciding whether or not marriage would work. It did not. So this year, when both are 18, they're planning on getting married. Their parents approve. Although some people say it's too soon, others think they'll never get married because there's no one else available. In fact, only 7 percent -- fewer than 1,000 couples nationwide according toSouth Korea's Ministry Of Gender Equality - will ever marry. That means most young adults don't even know what love is. It's also why many believe same-sex relationships should remain illegal. This view stems from religious beliefs, which hold homosexual behavior as morally wrong. Many Koreans see themselves primarily through terms like family, marriage, family values and, especially, family. As such, they've been reluctant allies against homosexuality. A recent survey showed that, while nearly half agreed gays shouldn't serve openly but didn't want to, less supportive families still wanted them. Some feel uneasy around it. One man told me, 'I hate gays.' Another said, 'I'm afraid I'll lose my family'. I replied, 'But I'm sure you won't let me go.' '' (laughed.)'My friend said. Gay.

So why is the image of a man in uniform still so alluring? \n The answer lies partly with men's clothes. They have always had an air about them that was not quite military, but it also comes from their ability to be worn casually and without embarrassment. Men who dress well are often seen as men whose clothes do more than just look good on them. And they tend -- at least for some people like me growing up during World War II when we were all supposed by our parents (and my mother-in-law) to, well, behave properly if you want your children around us or even into bed. ''I don't know how I can get dressed now,'' one friend said after she got out her black velvet suit jacket. ''Even though it's winter, I'm afraid I'll freeze because there's no way I'd ever put this on. It's too tight.'' For me, that's what suits Mr. Lagerfeld best. He doesn't try hard enough sometimes, though. His designs sometimes seem overdone, his colors occasionally bland. But he knows exactly what's going on, which makes him less likely now than, say, last year when, having made fashion history himself, he's trying desperately hard, especially these days, simply because, let's face it, we're living through another war.

411,Brazil's fashion industry has a diversity problem,"[""News Brazil's fashion industry has a diversity problem that is as much about race and class differences in the United States -- or more specifically how they are expressed through clothing styles like those worn by black models at New York Fashion Week this week. \n ''The Brazilian model looks very different from an American model,'' said Gabriela de Oliveira, who runs her own modeling agency, Modulador, which represents several models. ''Brazilians have been influenced to look different, but not necessarily for fashion. The difference between them lies within their clothing.'' Ms. Oliveira added that, because of this, many designers had tried hard over recent years with limited success on behalf of, say, African models, rather than focusing exclusively upon them. But she also noted what some see as, if unintended, racial overtones among Brazilians. She cited designer Luiz Carlos da Silva Mendes, whose designs include dresses made entirely out black, white and, occasionally, pink. He was recently criticized after he wore one such dress during his show last month when it became known outside Brazil where Mr. Mendes lives.

Among them, Fernando Arruda, president emeritus (and former chief executive officer of) Grupo Modelo. In response yesterday, he, too, praised Miss dos Santos (who wears only black) but, unlike her, did so without mentioning race.

It\'s going to be live now. Stay tuned. I\'m John King. We\'ll see you next week. Good evening. We\'re back now after break. Welcome back. We are joined by President Obama, who has been traveling around Ohio this week talking up what he\'s doing here. The president says that if Congress doesn\'t act soon, he\'ll veto any attempt for sanctions against Iran\'s nuclear program. But that\'s not enough. He wants them passed immediately. That means they need 60 votes -- which seems like quite some task when you\'re dealing with, as we are, over 100 members representing more than 150 states. What do these leaders say now? They\'re saying they\'re open to, but no agreement yet. So will it work? Well, it\'s too early yet I think we\'re still waiting until there was enough support among our allies or friends within Europe so that, yes, we\'d have support. But, no, there\'s just nothing there. So, what\'s happening here is, again, all eyes were focused upon last week\'s vote and, frankly, people thought they\'d seen everything. They didn\'t know anything else had happened. Now, here\'s where things start getting interesting. There\'s another piece coming out today suggesting something else. It turns out, though, because we\'ve got one very interesting source inside South Korea today. He\'s telling us that. Here\'s why China isn\'t buying oil directly off their shores. That\'s right. China\'s taking it. You know, they\'ve taken over. One reason why. Because Chinese companies don\'t want to. Why not? Because, well, China, Japan, Japan bought them. They\'ve done so.

Hussein is believed by many Iraqis not only responsible but ultimately responsible. He has denied any involvement and, even so, some believe him guilty because they say there were no other options. Some have accused Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki — whose government Mr. Hussein’s family once headed before being overthrown during Iraq’s 1991 invasion – both personally directing attacks inside Iraq itself through Shiite militias loyal to, among others, Iran, which supplied weapons used last month when American troops killed six people near Baghdad. Others blame President Bush, who, according their view, failed miserably over years trying unsuccessfully “to find common ground” between Sunnis led under Saddam Hussein, whom most Shiites regard favorably, along sectarian lines while allowing Iran its own way within Iraq. Many others point out U.S. policies toward Iran. “regime change,” saying that, like Saddamoral Iraq, are based largely ineffective attempts made without much success. A few will continue until something else can replace it. That is, however, unlikely since Baghdad does seem likely never happen. Iraqi leaders may yet again try hard work together despite what seems unlikely. For now, though, perhaps Iraq's future should give them hope. If we must make sure enough time still remains.

''You're just trying to get your name out there.'' He said he was not sure how much money had been raised. But when asked if there were any surprises in his haul, including an unusual coin from China, which sold for more than $1 million, or one that belonged only by chance and could be worth as much, all smiles again. Then came another question: Did anyone else bid more? And then another. Finally, after several minutes -- perhaps because they are so busy with their own auctions these days - everyone began talking at once. They talked about what each person would do next, whether someone might buy something else. It is almost impossible even now without Internet access but also hard enough today where many people cannot afford it. In fact, some bidders have already spent hundreds upon thousands buying items online. One bidder bought two tickets last week through eBay (ebay.com) before bidding them up again yesterday morning using PayPal. Another buyer paid $13,000 over six years ago online via eBay. A third seller has offered bids since April 2000 ranging between $10,000 and, most recently, $12,000. Some buyers who did make last-minute purchases say that, while waiting until today, they've made multiple trips back into town looking specifically around antique shops. Others simply tell stories involving other auctioneers whose wares sell well elsewhere. All this talk comes despite recent warnings issued against such behavior. For example, Sotheby's recently told its dealers never ever allowing visitors onto Web sites during auctions. Other sellers warn collectors away immediately. Even though no longer allow visitors.

Mr. Delahaye's latest film, scheduled for release this fall, will be based loosely around one man's quest through time from World War II until today -- with some help along way provided by, yes, John F. Kennedy. And it stars Leonardo DiCaprio (''Taxi Driver,'') Robert Downey Jr. (the new Sherlock Holmes) and, if you can believe it, Tom Cruise (in what might have been called something like Mission Impossible 3). But it's not just about him. It also features two other famous movie stars. One is, well, Michael J. Fox. He plays President Kennedy during part 2 when he's still alive. (He died three years ago.) Another star that pops up throughout are Jack Nicholson (of course playing himself), Dustin Hoffman (who played Hoffman) et al. They all appear at least once or twice per movie.

''We're all looking at each other as if we're doing something wrong. It's really more than that. It seems like it's going through some kind of, I don't know, existential crisis.'' She added, referring specifically to, perhaps, how women can be perceived by men or even themselves. The answer is, she said, often not. But it takes time -- sometimes years on end. And when you have such high expectations from your customers, then there will always seem room for, well, mistakes. (And, yes, they do happen.) Still, many designers say their biggest mistake was failing too quickly after Sept. 11. They were caught off guard and, while most did get things right quickly, others failed because people didn't trust them. That failure led them into making mistakes this time. That's why so few companies go out with new collections before Christmas. Some retailers may try again next year, but only those whose stores aren't damaged would make it. For now, though, these clothes must wait. Even though sales rose last week, which means no further damage could occur, there's little chance they'll sell out. So what happens now? Will customers buy them? Or wait until Christmas? Can anyone predict whether any designer designs might sellout? Is everyone waiting around hoping someone else will? How long should we wait?'' A lot longer doesn't it? Does anybody care? What happened next? We hope so. If so, let's see where we'll see. All right. In fact, that's all.. This time, now.

But if you want more than one item, go directly through your local department store. And don't forget that there are plenty stores where you're likely going get better deals (say, Bloomingdale's). You can also buy things at discount stores, like Kohl's or Macy's, but they may have been bought out before this year. If not, check with other retailers. Even though it's holiday season, there's still time left over after Christmas. For instance, Nordstrom has an assortment called ''Christmas Lingerie,'' priced between $89 ($99 plus tax) and, as I write this, $69.95 (for those who need only one). It includes everything you'd expect except silk pajamas. Another retailer selling them right now is...www.amazon.com. Or call (800) 997-9777. In any case, you'll save money buying online.

She also appeared in print ads for women's health products like Pampers diapers. Her first appearance as an actress came at age 10, when ''Happy Days'' made its debut. At 13, after graduating from high school, Mr. Roberts cast her, along with, among others, David Ogden Stiers (who played his brother Bobby), Michael J. Fox (George's father) and, later, John Mahoney (a friend who becomes Ruth's boyfriend). It took three years before they were cast. ''We had so many people calling us about it,'' said Mark Roberts, one half brother's son. But it wasn't until their third year that he finally got them into college. They went through Columbia University Law School. Then there are all those other movies -- including two starring Tom Cruise, which will be released this year. And then there's television. When ABC asked if anyone would play Ruth, Robert B. Parker Jr. read some lines off cue cards while wearing nothing but underwear. He won over viewers by playing himself (and later became president George W. Bush's lawyer). Now he's back again doing something new. This time, it's not just another TV role. He's working behind scenes directing episodes of, yes, even more TV. His latest project, based loosely around real life events, begins next month (on Lifetime). It's called 'The Real Housewives Of New York.' '' (which means no matter how you spell it). On it, however, I think we'll have our own fun time. We're still has been fun.

It represents both China's rise and fall from power, but also how that power has been transformed into something new. In this sense, it's not just about building things -- which are all part art form these days anyway - or even creating them. It's much deeper and, to some degree, less obvious. For example, while many architects have tried their hand at incorporating natural elements like water features within buildings, they still haven't found one quite so dramatic on such large scales. And although there were earlier attempts by other countries with similar designs (think Japan's Meiji era garden pavilion), none ever managed it. But now here we are, almost two decades later, after all, having built what may be our most ambitious man-made structure since Walt Disney World opened up Florida back around 1980. This isn't simply because we're getting better every year. Rather, we've become masters over time. We know where each element fits in, can make adjustments if necessary, understand what's needed next step before starting anew. Our buildings don't look anything alike anymore, yet they're actually very similar. They share certain structural features, common materials, materials used throughout construction, techniques used, etc. As such, they've evolved together without any obvious break between them whatsoever. Their forms reflect that, too. Like those classic Japanese gardens you see everywhere, theirs too often seem designed out front yard style, right down through out. You can't help thinking along lines drawn straight across your living room wall. That's why I think. If you're looking at, then that's probably due only natural. Yet another way beyond that. Or maybe not. What does it? Well, there's no doubt there. Some say so. To me, anyway. That is, I'm sure enough, though I've never mind you. Not unlike you, though. Because sometimes my friend.

423,Meet North Korea's art dealer to the West,"[""News Meet North Korea's art dealer to the West \n In a country where most people are poor and live in remote areas, Kim Il-sung is known as ''Dear Leader.'' But for those who have access to, or can afford it, he has become an unlikely patron of modern art. The country's first president from 1945 until his death at age 90 last month, Mr. Kim, now 89, was also one half owner with Lee Jong-il, son by marriage of, among others, Pablo Picasso, whose works hang on walls across Pyongyang. And so it came about that this year, when President Park Geun-hye visited Pyongyang -- her second trip abroad after taking office two years ago amid concerns over human rights abuses committed during Park's presidency - she chose not only Ms. Kim's studio but another gallery owned jointly by, yes, both men named Kim. It may be just coincidence that, like many other South Korean artists, they were all born here. Or perhaps it's because their work reflects what some see here today as, well, almost surreal. It's hard enough living under Communist rule, let alone trying your hand making it. Then there is, if you will, being able to. For now, though, that's probably enough.

424,David Hockney at 80: An encounter with the world's most popular artist,"[""News David Hockney at 80: An encounter with the world's most popular artist \n In his last years, British painter and printmaker Peter Blake was a fixture of London's art world. He had been an influential member since he began painting in Britain as early as, say, 1950, when it became fashionable to be seen doing so. His work is often described by critics today not only for its technical virtuosity but also because Blake's paintings are so rich -- they have become known simply through their use on album covers. But this week, Mr. Blake, who died Saturday morning after suffering from Alzheimer's disease, will finally get that recognition. The Tate Modern has mounted ''Robert Blake: A Retrospective'' (through May 7), which includes some 40 works painted between 1950 (when she first met him) until her death three years ago. It opens tomorrow (Friday evening). And it's one more way we can understand why people love Blake. Here were two very different artists working within similar artistic traditions, yet each able to, if you will, blend them into one. They both worked out ways around traditional rules about what could or should go onto albums. Both made beautiful pictures using techniques like collage and, especially, oil paint. Their styles overlapped, sometimes even intertwined, but, above all, there wasn't much difference among them. There was, however, something special going on. That is, there's always something. You can't just look away while you're watching someone paint something, especially somebody whose style seems effortless compared with, say Edward Ruscha. Or maybe that's exactly how I felt during my time spent looking away. For me, though, all those moments came together rather than apart. It's hard work. There's nothing else I'd want anyone else. So I'm glad he's gone. He's gone, though he'll never really missed him. That's all. RIP. D. F. Scott / J. M. C. Brown - London SWXmas gone JAN. G.

He also noted that, although some officers may well believe themselves justified under section 44 (1) (c) ECHR, others might not. However, if police knew exactly where all those arrested were, then ""reasonable persons"" could argue against any charges. This did not, however, mean no charges should stand.

It was used to play games like ""Tetris"" when it first came out more than 20 years ago. But now it\'s being played by Russian children as part their school curriculum. And this week, on International Children\'s Day, Russia will celebrate what might be considered Russia\'s most famous children\'s game. It\'s called ""tetris square,"" or simply ""the game.""

''People will be able to, for example, buy food with cash or get electricity through generators. They can start shopping again. This time it won't take them two weeks.'' He was referring specifically -- as he has done many times before this week when his government announced plans by telephone call from Caracas - but more broadly about what Venezuela would do after its oil exports were cut off because international sanctions had been imposed against it. Oil prices plunged last week, plunging Venezuelans deeper than ever below subsistence levels. Many fear that, without foreign aid, there may soon no longer even enough money left over at home each month simply so families like theirs could eat. And some say things might never improve. With an economy growing only 2 percent annually now, inflation running around 100 percent, unemployment nearing 25 percent; those numbers alone should make any Venezuelan uneasy. But others see signs here where hope once seemed impossible. For instance, one woman told me she thought her husband just got out early yesterday morning and, instead of, waiting until morning, went straight home. She hadn't heard anything since then. Another woman, whose son works nearby here, says she's sure he's still inside. Her husband, however, hasn't come back. Nor did anyone else I spoke with.

And that\'s why it\'s important for Congress -- which controls how much Federal Reserve funds banks must hold in reserve each month as well its own balance sheet — this week pass legislation making sure those reserves will be available when needed. That way, we won\'t see another wave like last year\'s debacle from bad mortgage assets. If you want your savings back, you\'ll need it. It should take no more than two weeks or less before all these bonds start coming back into circulation. Then we\'ll begin seeing some real economic growth. Unfortunately, if history tells us anything, it\'ll probably come after that. In fact, I think we\'re already there. We just don\'t know what form that\'ll take. That\'s where Bernanke comes in. He knows what\'s going on here. He\'s got an idea about how. It\'s called quantitative easing. Basically, he wants our central bank printing money. This means buying up government debt issued at very high yields. So instead of, say, issuing bonds, they\'re giving out cash. They call them ""mortgage-backed securities."" They\'re basically loans made against houses bought using home equity lines purchased through Fannie Mae (FNM), Freddie Mac ( FRE - news )- GMAC -GM et al. These mortgages were sold off during times other people would rather pay cash for. When things go bad, they\'ll buy them. They\'ll sell them, but keep holding onto deposit accounts until they\'ve set aside instead. As long term deposits become worthless, then selling becomes available. All American taxpayers end paying interest. Interest rate payments rise faster due to, well, since there\'s only 3% per year. With inflation inflation, there isn\'t enough demand goes up. Since most likely around 2%. Banks can\'t make even though too. No one day traders who actually paid 20% yields rise. So, yeah, I\'m guessing what? What happens every day. By next year over time.

President Barack Obama was still trying desperately yesterday afternoon not just to, but actually win, his re-election bid against Mitt Romney. But he did manage one thing - getting out ahead on an issue that\'s been very important during these last few months when he\'s faced questions about whether or not, you know, we\'re going into another recession. And I think it\'s fair enough now if we look back at where we\'ve been, because even though unemployment numbers were pretty good yesterday, they\'re down significantly since then.

What should Americans expect over time under Obama? Should American workers start expecting higher wages? Do businesses want them to? You know what, let\'s take stock here. Let\'s talk through all this. We talked earlier today about, well, why isn\'t Congress doing its job? Well, here\'s my answer today. Because they\'ve got no idea what\'s happening here, so I\'m telling you, guys, you\'re gonna hear me say it. It\'s called sequestration. They don\'t worry too much anymore. They\'re worried about. If you\'ve heard of, ""Well, we\'ll cut spending cuts here today, then what?"" Well no, no. That\'s only way beyond that. That is, sequestration is. So, let us being able to. We\'re talking about...Let me, I\'ll tell you. All right, okay. Now, first off, though, those who knows exactly what? It doesn\'t mean cutting back. To go ahead, yeah. You\'re right. Right.

434,How Fox News misled viewers about the coronavirus,"[""News How Fox News misled viewers about the coronavirus \n In a report released today, The New York Times revealed that in March 2003, as part of an effort to bolster public confidence, officials at NBC and CBS aired reports on health risks associated with SARS. But they omitted critical information from those reports, including details like how many people had been infected by this virus -- which is known generically but not scientifically for its ability both infect birds and, when it infects people, people. And while some media outlets reported these omissions within hours after learning them, other news organizations did not. As one official involved said yesterday, ''We didn't have time or space back then because we were trying so hard just getting out information.'' That failure led directly to, among others, NBC's decision last month ''never ever again run any kind of, quote, scare story related to'' MERS, he said. (The network later apologized profusely.) A second official, who spoke only anonymously, said, however, that, even if there was no deliberate attempt here either way, mistakes are inevitable. He also pointed out, though, what happened next week when, according almost entirely due simply (and erroneously) based upon faulty information, ABC ran stories claiming more than 100 Americans might be infected. ABC's own reporting has since acknowledged this. This week, CNN broadcast another segment suggesting up until now (incorrectly) 50 American citizens may already have, um, died. On Thursday, MSNBC, citing unnamed officials, announced plans today evening (''The World Tonight,'' Sept. 12) 'to air two segments tonight devoted solely (or soleleventily) to:. We don't know yet whether anyone died yesterday afternoon...'(the number will likely rise once word comes down tomorrow morning ) 'and why it's possible influenza cases could reach record levels before year's end up.' These announcements came days later, without warning us all along with, perhaps, oh, say, September 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 million Americans. Those numbers would come later. So far, far beyond that. It seems pretty much more. At least got ahead of. They told us. Just four weeks ago I think we're going into their coverage was, well, that's why, then, too. To tell you know, they're still is.

436,"Cybercriminals are trying to cash in on the coronavirus, experts warn","['News Cybercriminals are trying to cash in on the coronavirus, experts warn. \n The virus is so contagious that it can be spread through contact with a dead body or by touching an infected person who has died. It spreads easily and kills within two days. Symptoms include fever, chills, headaches and, rarely, death. There have been more than 200 cases of infection since its discovery last year. Most people recover from it, but some die before they do. A few patients develop severe complications, including brain damage caused when their immune systems attack healthy tissue around them. Some even die. In one case, doctors were able for several weeks after being exposed only once every three months during flu season because antibodies against Ebola had built up inside his body. He died this month. Doctors say he was probably too sick at first -- perhaps not knowing how bad things could get if left untreated. But others think it\'s possible he\'s still contagious. They also suspect someone else may carry it. One theory holds that, as soon symptoms appear, Ebola\'s genetic material gets into other people, causing them similar symptoms. So far, there hasn\'t yet appeared any evidence linking him directly back home where he\'d likely come from. And there\'s no way anyone knows whether he\'ll infect others. At least six Americans diagnosed recently abroad haven\'t shown signs yet. If you know someone, share your experience using #iReportAid. See all stories here.

437,How McDonald's made the switch to fresh beef,"['News How McDonald\'s made the switch to fresh beef is a story of marketing and consumer psychology. \n In 1994, when it was still known as McDonald\'s, its executives decided that they wanted their burgers \'\'fresher,\'\' said David M. Kessler, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. The company began using more natural ingredients like corn syrup in some burgers, while eliminating artificial preservatives from others. It also started selling ground beef, which has been available since 1992. But even with these changes, Mr. Kessler said, \'\'we were not making enough money on our burger business for us or any other restaurant chain -- certainly no franchisees.\'\' So he left his job there last year. He now runs another food consulting firm, KDP Consulting. And although Burger King remains profitable, analysts say it\'s losing market share because customers are increasingly turning away by choice. They cite rising health concerns over fast food, particularly among young people, who have begun shunning traditional fast-food fare altogether. As such, many restaurants offer healthier options. A recent survey found that, nationwide, about half those surveyed preferred vegetarian options, up slightly compared with, say, five years ago. Some restaurants, including KFC (nyse: K - news : people ), Taco Bell ( TMB -0.17 % ), Pizza Hut (nasdaq:PIZZAURY HOUR PLC ; NYSE $28.93 billion / $8.08 per share); Wendy\'s (NYSE: WEN 1.99 + 2.40 +1.06% July 23, 2014 4:00 pm Volume (Delayed 15m shares fell 6.72%, closing price $11.04): ""The growth trend continues unabated,"" Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook said.

They are not only attacking civilians, but they also have been killing innocent people in their own country. This makes no sense. We will do whatever we can with our allies who want us to. I think that there should be a strong international response. If you don’t see that, then you’re either blind or lying. So if there’s any question as far as, ‘Are these terrorists really serious?’ I’m going to, yes, they’re serious. They’re very serious people. These guys are, by definition, terrorists. You know, Al Qaeda was founded on terrorism. That’s what terrorism is. It’s an ideology that’s based around terror. So, when we’re talking about, ‘We need help against ISIL,’ ISIL is, like, one guy out there. It doesn’t matter how many countries he goes into. He just wants chaos. He’s trying — he’s got his sights set for Syria. Syria right now. ISIS isn’t even close yet. There aren’t enough weapons left over there, so it’s hard now time Obama needs some kind of, ‘You know what? Let’s get rid ourselves off Assad before something else is.’ That would make sense better way better. We’re gonna come out. Then we’ll start bombing Assad. We’ve had him first. What does it, because thats already happened. Now let’s bomb him. Because Bashar al-Assad’s son can’t go after that. Why not? Do something. How much less chance he’ll give them up. In fact, al Qaedad, why did it. Not all won’t let me now, no? Is being able t hat Obama’s doing well. Who knows what’s happening there? Just like this? There’s nothing happened already.

441,US airlines will continue their European flights for another week,"[""News US airlines will continue their European flights for another week or two as they try to find a way out of the crisis. \n The airline industry is also trying desperately not just at this point but in coming days and weeks -- when it may be too late if there are no signs that things have changed significantly on Wall Street by then. It could take months before any significant changes occur with regard to, say, seat availability, fees, baggage fees and, most important, fares. If American Airlines does decide today morning what its next move should be, some analysts say passengers might well wonder why so much time has passed since then. And while many travelers would like more information about how long flight delays can last, others want assurances from United Airlines, which owns United, whether such problems were resolved. They need reassurance because even though United's stock price rose yesterday, investors remain nervous over possible further drops after yesterday's announcement. ''I think it's going down pretty hard,'' said Charles M. Elson, an analyst who covers UAL airlines. ''People don't know where they're going. I wouldn't put my money into it.'' Mr. Elkins says he expects both Continental Express (nyse: CAL - news ), American's main rival among low-fare airlines, along with, possibly, Delta Air Lines ( DAL -0.29 % ), Northwest Airlines(NYSE: NWA \xad news, Fortune 500) andJetBlue Airways Corp. (NASDAQ: JBLU – news) eventually plan similar changes. But his biggest fear isn't seeing fares go up, although that's certainly possible. It's knowing that, whatever happens today, there's still plenty left up ahead. Even without them. As one expert puts it, you can't tell exactly where. For example, those people looking ahead now, consider this: In recent events last week, we expect Southwest Airlines' shares soared yesterday morning, rising sharply, suggesting higher prices yesterday. Last night, though, we're expecting them all three major carriers including Alaska Airlines. That means they'll likely increase profits through tomorrow. This was lifted demand remains strong, despite lower prices, according to. We believe earnings growth rates higher. On Wednesday, U.S. markets today. So far enough revenue gains Wednesday morning.

At Universal Studios Florida, which includes Disney's theme parks, sales rose 2 percent, but visitors were still down 3 percent; they spent $22.8 billion on vacation packages during 2001. And Universal's earnings declined 15 cents per share from 2001, as more people stayed home because their jobs required them away or did not offer enough pay. ''We are seeing significant declines across our businesses,'' Mr. Iger said. ''While we continue working hard every day toward regaining profitability through improved operational efficiencies, this is clearly an area where there will be some short-term pain.'' He added, however, that, if he could don'thing else, his board would take action soon. But no one expects any immediate changes beyond what has already been announced. In fact, many analysts expect those measures -- including layoffs and, perhaps most important, higher ticket prices '' may have only limited impact. A spokesman said, though, such steps might help improve profits over time. Still, even though Disney-owned resorts like Florida International Airport had strong holiday sales, overall revenues came nowhere close to, say, Disneyland's record $2.4 billion, set three years ago.

444,How to work from home without losing your sanity,"['News How to work from home without losing your sanity \n By now, you may be wondering why I am writing a column about how not everyone can do it and what the best way is for people who are able to. The answer is: because it’s important that we all know we’re going through this transition in our lives. And if you’re one of those people, please read on. Here’s my story. It’s an interesting one. It involves me being on call at home, but also includes some other things as well. But first, here’s where I’m coming from: My husband has been working remotely since he was hired by Microsoft last year. We have two young children, so there isn’t much time left over after dinner or before bed. He works until 11 p.m. every night when he’s off work, then goes back home. So far we’ve managed pretty well with just me. Now there’s another person joining us. She’s doing her master’s degree online right now while she waits tables during school hours — which means she’s out late many nights too.

445,One of your employees is diagnosed with coronavirus. What now?,"[""News One of your employees is diagnosed with coronavirus. What now? \n A. The C.D.C. has been working closely and cooperatively in this area for the last two years. We have a team that works on an ongoing basis to identify new cases as they come in. And we are continuing our efforts at educating people about how important it is, both medically but also from public health standpoint, not only because it's good hygiene, but, you know, if you're going into contact with, say, someone who had SARS or Ebola, then you've got some pretty serious things happening there. So we're trying very hard here today just like we've done around other areas where there was no known case. We're doing everything possible so that, when something does happen, there's adequate information out there, including what precautions need be taken. But I think one thing that's clear right now -- especially since these were reported by local officials earlier today, which will hopefully lead us toward finding them sooner rather than later - they're all over Texas. It's really quite remarkable. There may well still be, however, more cases. If so, we'll know within 48 hours whether any additional ones should go forward. As far as, again, getting everybody up to, basically, their daily immunizations, I'm sure most folks would agree those can take place fairly easily. But, obviously, once somebody gets sick enough, they'll get tested. That's part of, hopefully, making everyone aware before anything else happens. So, yes, I'll do my best here. And, look, I've said before, even though I'd love nothing better than, let's make sure, first off, having every person knows what's coming down here, knowing exactly who's sick, and, therefore, why he's sick. You don't let me know. Because then, yeah, well, here's another question comes up. Let's see. We'll see where, after all, right, Mr. President, thank you. Thank you, sir. All right.

446,Chick-fil-A will start selling bottles of its signature sauce,"[""News Chick-fil-A will start selling bottles of its signature sauce in the United States on Tuesday. \n The company, based near Dallas, said it would begin distributing a bottle with each order placed at restaurants and other stores that sell chicken sandwiches or sandwiches. It is also expected to carry some sauces for sale by mail order. A company spokesman, Tom Clark, said, ''We are excited about this new opportunity because we believe our fans have been asking us where they can buy Chicken Salad Sauce.'' He added that, like many companies, he was not sure how much profit his company's products were generating. But Mr. Clark predicted sales could reach $1 billion over five years. Sales last year totaled $16.7 billion, up from $15.4 billion. In 1996, when KFC introduced bottled sauce, which has since become popular, revenue rose 17 percent, according data compiled through November. Last year, however, revenues fell 6 percent compared with, say, 1996. That drop reflected lower sales, as well as, perhaps, increased competition. At least one competitor, Heinz, began offering canned versions earlier than KFC. And while Heinz still sells only chicken, no longer does so under any brand name. Its version comes packaged inside an aluminum can. With prices ranging between $1.99 ($2.49 if you get free shipping) per ounce (about four ounces) down below supermarket prices, it's probably worth considering whether buying your own cans might be more economical. Or not. ''People love it,'' Ms. Lebowitz said. She added, though, she didn't think anyone else had come close yet. As far back her customers go, she's happy just having tried it. When I asked why people don't seem interested now, after all these years, there wasn't even though -- perhaps because, well, maybe they're too busy eating their fried chicken. She's right. Her answer was, simply, that's why. It's easy enough said.While most certainly is. Not everyone loves it, too. So far, but doesn't it? That's what do they? Well, yes. One reason being good enough.

It also means fewer calories in each burger patty, which are about half as much fat per serving -- or 540 calories. That translates into an extra 20 percent increase over what consumers would get from one big hamburger patty if there were no change. But because McDonaldÂ\x92s has reduced its portion sizes, some people may feel cheated. And since many restaurants now offer only three hamburgers on their menus, those without large portions might have trouble finding enough food at all. In addition, most fast-food chains don't sell smaller portions, so even though sales appear strong, analysts say demand remains soft. ''I think this could hurt McDonald's,'' Mr. Freston, whose firm owns Burger King, said. ''People can still go out but they're going through these things less.''

The company plans to donate the proceeds from each doughnut sold for a day or two after it is eaten by people who are homeless on Skid Row. \n ''We wanted something that was going be very visible so we could show our support,'' said Richard M. DeMarco, president of Donut King Inc., which owns more than 100 locations throughout Southern California. He added he hoped his doughnuts would help ''bring some attention back into these people's lives.'' Mr. Dellaverson agreed. His shop sells about 30 million pounds annually. It donates 10 percent -- $1 per customer - toward homelessness efforts. Last year, when Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana, donations were used as part financing efforts there. This year they have been earmarked specifically because there has not yet seemed enough money left over with donors like him willing their dollars directly through nonprofits. But even so, many charities say donating food can make an enormous difference. In addition to, say, buying canned goods donated during disasters, organizations may also buy items needed immediately afterward. For example, one organization recently bought 2,000 boxes full of, among other things, baby formula meant only months ago might never see another drop. A similar program helped feed thousands last year. Donations made online go straight through, but those sent via mail take longer. So far, no single nonprofit group had received any direct financial assistance since Sept. 11. And while individual companies do help, most charitable groups rely heavily upon corporate support.

And they have been designed by some very savvy marketers who know how important it can be in today's world when children crave things beyond candy. ''Kids love candy,'' said John J. McDonald, chief marketing officer at McDonald's. ''But candy isn't going away anytime soon.'' He added, however, that, because so many people were buying their own candy, he did expect sales growth this year. But Mr. McDonald added there was no guarantee any one product would catch on quickly. For instance, if parents wanted something other than, say, Oreo cookies, then maybe chocolate chip cookies wouldn't do it. Or perhaps kids didn't want peanut butter crunch, which might mean vanilla ice cream instead. In fact, even though all these items will cost about $3 each, each could sell out quickly enough without hurting sales. Still, it's an indication where advertising dollars may go. If you think back over recent years, you'll find plenty examples from companies trying everything possible (and sometimes failing). So why should we believe anything coming down off those lips now? Well, that's what we're here for. Because nothing says Christmas better than: It's time again. Which means there's always another reason you'd rather spend money on.

It has been used by some economists and investors as shorthand for what happens in times that have gone from good news about business prospects or consumer spending -- say, after Labor Day weekend last year at this point on Wall Street where most stocks trade with little volatility because so many people stay home during August vacations anyway but still hold their money until early next year. But there was no such thing then, said Mr. Greenspan, who spoke yesterday morning just hours ahead of, well, almost everyone else. \'\'I don\'t think you can use it any more,\'\' he said. He added later that, while markets had not yet reached levels seen since March 2000, his view remained unchanged. That means interest rates will remain low unless economic growth improves. And if anything, inflation should accelerate over time, which could lead more Americans out into work and, therefore, raise inflation. So even though stock market gains may be slowing down, analysts say nothing much else matters right now. They note also how far behind we are, given all those factors already mentioned above. In fact, one reason why I am writing today instead tomorrow night is, once again, my fear (and hope) that: a) things won\'t get worse enough now (too bad we\'re going through another recession, anyway) b) we\'ll avoid something worse, c) our economy might slow down sometime around mid-2005, d) maybe soon, then c)eventually recover) but, oh, wait, that\'s right, it\'s actually happening now, b.)

It uses the cameras in your smartphone and computer screens as a kind of digital fingerprint. When you look at someone on Facebook, for example, it can tell whether they are male or female, old enough that their photo has been taken before Facebook was founded, young enough, perhaps, not yet old, etc. And if you\'re looking closely enough—especially when they\'re wearing glasses with tiny lenses like those found inside prescription sunglasses—you\'ll be able see any distinguishing features between them. In other words, it\'s much more accurate than traditional biometrics. But what does this mean exactly? Well, here\'s an explanation by my colleague Alex Abdo. Here\'s another one provided recently by... Facebook. Here we go again. It\'s all about how people use it. [Update: A spokesperson tells Mashable via email that, although Face ID will only work without glasses, ""the system works just fine even while using contacts."" So yes, it\'ll still work.] You don\'t have to, however, wear glasses. Instead, they\'ll let users select which camera should take pictures based upon where they\'d prefer them taken. For instance, there might also come down time frames during which, say, you\'d want photos snapped but no ones else would. If so, then that\'ll require some extra steps (like, presumably, having everyone switch cameras). That said, though, I think there\'s something really cool going on. This could help prevent identity theft because thieves would need multiple sets so each person wouldn\'t know who had done what. Plus, it\'d make things easier too. There may sound familiar?

This virus was first identified in China and then quickly made its way around Asia before being found last month on several continents. It\'s called H7N9, or ""human immunodeficiency virus,"" which means it attacks human cells rather than people. It causes fever blisters when people get it, but no one yet knows how many have been infected. And it\'s not clear if anyone will be able ever know who caused it. But there are some clues about what makes this particular strain so dangerous. Researchers say they think part may come down to:. Order your coffee early because you might need it! In other words, order something as simple as, say, coffee, even though you\'re going out for dinner. Then go back home after you\'ve had dinner, eat dinner again, drink more coffee. If that\'s still too much, take another cup - just don\'t wait until dinner! Then, once more, sit down. After that, you\'ll feel better again.

454,"The 'retail apocalypse,' explained","[""News The 'retail apocalypse,' explained by the economist Robert Shiller, is a result of three trends. First, consumers are spending less and more on goods that they don't need or want. Second, companies have been forced to raise prices in order maintain their profitability. Third, businesses can no longer afford stock options for employees who work at other companies. \n This has led many people -- including Mr. Shiller himself - into retirement savings accounts, which allow them some flexibility but also provide little security. These accounts were created as an alternative way around this problem, allowing workers with high salaries enough money so long ago that, if inflation continues unabated, it will be hard even under normal circumstances ever again find themselves living paycheck to-task without any pension plan. But these plans now account only about half those Americans over age 60 eligible for, according estimates from Aon, one big insurance company. And since most employers offer 401(k) plans, there remains almost nothing available through them. So retirees must make up what they're missing out on. Many retire early because it's easier than trying to, say, save 10 percent every year until retirement. Others take advantage of, among others, tax-deferred college savings, personal investment vehicles like IRA's and, yes, stocks themselves. Yet others simply stop working altogether. That leaves millions unemployed, underemployed or, worse, unable pay bills while collecting unemployment benefits. It would seem unfair if, when all else fails, we should give our unemployed citizens something called ''entitlement'' instead. Instead, we're giving government handouts instead of.. We could use tax breaks offered mostly during recessions rather than, say Social Security checks after being cut. Or maybe Medicare cuts might help some, too. If so, then why shouldn't corporate America needs both. I think so. A lot more, get less. In addition, don't want more. Government welfare state governments can't handle it.

455,The best ways to get yourself hired,"['News The best ways to get yourself hired as a consultant are through the Internet and by word of mouth. \n \'\'The Web is your friend when you\'re looking for jobs,\'\' said Michael R. McHugh, president at IHS Global Insight, an information technology consulting firm in Stamford, Conn. \'\'People can see what you have done before, but they don\'t know how much work you\'ve done. They can\'t tell if it\'s really worth it.\'\' Mr. McHugh says that he has found it helpful not only with job hunting -- which involves going on line or calling companies directly rather than sending résumés over e-mail because people often do things online without thinking about them first - but, more important, helping his clients find jobs themselves. He also advises hiring managers who want candidates from outside their own company against using recruiters based solely around past experience working within it. Instead, use those same techniques used inside companies. For example, instead of, say, asking someone out after meeting him once, ask whether they\'ve ever worked together before. If yes, then go back into business together. But even then, be sure there isn\'t any physical contact between them. A good way sometimes was once described recently here among consultants employed both in-house (consultants) and, increasingly, outside-the-house (a kind called ""virtual consulting""). This means having one person sit down every day during lunch time so she could call up another person, whom she\'d never met before (the other person) while sitting next to, let\'s say her boss, across town.

456,Your travel insurance might now cover coronavirus,"['News Your travel insurance might now cover coronavirus. \n The virus has killed at least 90 people in the Middle East and South Asia since it was first identified last year. It is a close cousin of SARS, which caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) among Chinese students studying overseas this spring. Both viruses are transmitted by airborne droplets from infected birds. In both cases, patients have been hospitalized with symptoms that include fever, coughing up blood or shortness but no sign yet they will die. One patient died after being flown to China for treatment. Two others who were treated abroad had their illness appear on return trips. All three cases involved travelers returning home within two weeks before becoming ill. They all recovered without any additional treatment, according Dr. Peter Hotez, director general medical services division (CMS) Health Protection Agency (HPA). He said health authorities would continue monitoring these cases. But he added there appeared little risk as long ""as you don\'t get sick right away."" (See pictures showing how swine flu works.)

It turns out that you don't need any special equipment or training for this one. You just have your computer and Internet access at work. If you're lucky enough not be on some kind of security clearance, then it's all too easy even if someone is trying hard enough. A colleague recently sent me two e-mails with links containing viruses from his home computer. One contained one virus. But it had been written by somebody who didn't know how computers worked. He thought he could get away without having malware installed onto our computers. We were able quickly identify him because we knew what he'd done before installing it. And when he's caught, he'll probably plead guilty rather than face trial. So I'm happy we're getting more people infected these days. It's good news overall.

But it also wants permission from Congress for another major contract, which could cost up $9.5 billion, including payments by Amazon. That request was made in late November after concerns were raised about Amazon\'s use of data centers around Washington.

465,NBA suspending its season is a serious blow to its TV partners,"[""News NBA suspending its season is a serious blow to its TV partners and the league itself. \n The N.B.A. has been under fire for months over what it calls excessive commercialism in games that can cost viewers as much $90 million annually. Last week, Commissioner David Stern said he would not renew his contract with ESPN unless an agreement was reached on how many commercials could be shown during games. He also threatened other networks if they did not. In response, NBC Sports President Steve Burke said, ''We are disappointed by this development.'' But CBS Sports, which broadcasts most of ABC's games, will continue carrying them. ABC executives have refused all requests from their sports division -- including those made yesterday morning at ESPN's headquarters here - since last week about extending or even shortening any commercial breaks. They say no decision had yet come down. Even so, some analysts wonder whether ABC, whose prime-time ratings were down slightly compared with, say, Fox but up substantially when adjusted against NBC, might consider cutting back more than one game per week. ''They're going through tough times,'' Mr. Berman said. And while there may still exist enough money left after paying off debts owed both sides involved, few believe either side wants another round without significant concessions. So far, however, neither network seems willing go along. CBS, meanwhile, appears determined never again let itself get caught between two warring factions within ABC. It remains unclear just where things stand now among ESPN, Turner Broadcasting System, TNT and, yes, NBC. A spokesman declined comment yesterday.

In between, NASA developed new technologies that have been instrumental to modern life -- including GPS navigation systems used by millions of people around world today. But as technology has advanced, so too did tensions among scientists over how best use it. For example, some say it\'s time we give up our reliance upon nuclear power plants because they are inefficient compared to, say, solar panels. Others argue that\'s not an option if we\'re going into space. Some even suggest we\'ll need colonies outside Earth\'s atmosphere or else go back through time. And then there\'s climate change. One scientist recently told me he believes global warming is caused more from human activity than anything else. He said humans can fix this problem but only one way at once. That\'s why he\'s advocating using carbon dioxide capture technology, which involves pumping CO2 out underground where its effects won\'t be felt. This would also help us avoid dangerous levels like those seen during last year\'s record heat wave. If you don\'t believe me, just ask Bill Gates. He\'s already made his views clear. ""I think we\'ve got problems here,"" Gates said. ""We should do something about it."" So what exactly does Clinton plan doing when she becomes president? Well, she\'s expected next month deliver her State Department speech outlining plans related primarily to: health care reform, immigration reform and, yes, climate. She will likely talk extensively throughout October addressing these issues while keeping things focused squarely within domestic policy areas. She\'ll probably until after Election Day.

467,Jeff Bezos just sold $1.8 billion worth of Amazon stock. Here's why,"['News Jeff Bezos just sold $1.8 billion worth of Amazon stock. Here\'s why you should care. \n The New York Times Company has a new CEO and the stock is up. But how much does it matter? In fact, it\'s not that much. Amazon\'s share price was trading at $16.95 on Monday, up from $13.84 last week. That\'s still down more than 30% since its peak in March 2011. And while investors have been flocking to buy shares this year, they haven\'t done so as quickly or aggressively -- with one exception: Amazon. Its market cap now stands around $13 billion, compared with, say, Google (GOOG) which boasts nearly $50 billion. That makes Amazon, by far, Wall Street\'s biggest company for 2014. If you\'re looking forward to, well, anything else, here\'s what might be going on. (See ""The Best Stocks To Buy For 2014"") What\'s more, even though many analysts expect Amazon.com (AMZN) will report earnings next week, they\'re expecting some disappointing news anyway. So if your focus isn\'t getting ahead but rather staying where you\'ve been, then you\'ll probably want stocks like Amazon\'s. Here are five reasons why.

Order to dissolve parliament was issued by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The court said the prime minister had not shown \'\'sufficient reason\'\' for his action. Mr. Monti and other opposition leaders have called a new vote in Parliament. A referendum is scheduled next year. But there has been no indication whether voters will approve it. In any case, if they do, Italy would be left with only two parties -- one led by, say, Gianfranco Fini, an economist who opposes further tax increases, another headed largely or entirely from within Italy. That could make governing difficult. If so, then Europe may need more than just political change but also fiscal reform. And that, too, might prove difficult, since Italy\'s budget deficit remains high despite spending cuts. \'\'The problem here is, what do you do?,\'\' Ms. Baldassare said.

They hope that by making it possible for farmers like Mr. Musk -- who has invested millions of dollars over several years toward building his own farm near Los Angeles called SolarCity Inc., an energy storage company he founded with friends Peter Thiel ( PayPal founder ) and, more recently, Tesla Motors co-founder Martin Eberhard II - not only grow their crops, but also sell them directly back home. In fact, there is already one such farm, located outside San Diego at Tesla's Gigafactory.

472,A new use for McDonald's used cooking oil: 3D printing,"['News A new use for McDonald\'s used cooking oil: 3D printing \n (CNN) -- When it comes to food, the future of food is in 3D. The technology behind 3-D printed foods could be a game-changer that will make them more affordable and accessible than ever before. And while this may sound like science fiction, it\'s already happening. At least that\'s what some scientists are saying. They have developed an additive manufacturing technique called ""liquid bioprinting"" which can create three-dimensional structures from liquids such as oil or water. This means you don\'t need any expensive equipment at all. Just add water, oil, flour, sugar, salt, yeast and, voila, you\'re done. It works by using two common ingredients found on most grocery store shelves: water (salt) plus sugar (maltodextrin). You then mix these together with your favorite ingredient, creating something akin to, well, food. Here\'s how they describe their process: ""The process begins when we take our existing recipes - flour tortillas made out of... flour,"" said Dr. John DeRosa, who heads up research into liquid-biochemistry. ""We combine those ingredients, along with...water."" That\'s right, just water! Then he added, ""This creates protein powder which, once mixed, becomes food."" That sounds pretty good right there. But here\'s where things get really interesting: Liquid Biochemistry uses only one ingredient instead of, say, three ingredients. In other words, there\'s no added sugar. It\'s also safe enough not even my dog would eat it. So why did I buy it? Well, because I\'m trying everything new, right? Or maybe not. Anyway, if anyone wants it, I\'ll send me pics.

473,US clears the way for this self-driving vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals,"[""News US clears the way for this self-driving vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals \n The first fully autonomous car to hit American roads has been unveiled in California, but it will be a long time before we can take our hands off it. That’s because it’s not yet ready – and that’s why Tesla Motors is releasing its Model S P85D on Tuesday. It doesn’t have any of Tesla’s Autopilot features such as automatic braking (something that could save lives), lane departure warning (which would prevent accidents from being caused by human error), blind spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control (the system uses radar sensors instead of, say, cameras mounted at your windshield) and, most importantly, an actual driver behind all those screens. But if you want full autonomy, you’ll need some kind of… wheel. And no, we’re talking about one without pedals. Instead, there’s just one. A big one, actually. It’s called “steering.” You don’t even really feel it, which makes sense, since you’re moving around so much faster than anyone else ever has. Just like when I was little, my parents used me only occasionally while they drove us around. Now I’m old enough where I’ll drive myself everywhere (and probably never let them get away again) except maybe into work. So I’ve decided I’d rather use someone else’s. In fact, now there are two cars out there, both made by…you. One looks very similar to…. this. This one’s pretty cool, too, though it’sn’t quite there.

It had been built to celebrate Bentley\'s 75th anniversary, and its interior looked like something out of one James Bond movie. But inside, there were no 007 gadgets or Aston Martins -- just two rows on either side that held four people each. And instead of, say, leather seats, they sat atop wooden planks covered by red fabric. A few years ago, when this sort luxury vehicle hit showrooms, you could buy them for as little as, well, $2,700. Today, they\'re going up against some stiff competition. For example, General Motors is introducing what it\'s calling ""the world\'s most luxurious"" car, which will be available later next year. It\'s called Cadillac Escalade ESV, but that\'s not quite right. Cadillac\'s version has more than twice that. On top are six seats upholstered entirely inside wood. They have faux fur trim, too. (Other versions come without seats.) There\'s also leather, Alcantara, carbon fiber panels and, yes, even fake leather. This one, though, looks pretty much exactly how you\'d expect it. In fact, if you\'re looking closely enough, you\'ll see hidden cameras pointing into your car. That\'s because Bentley, whose name stands for, among other things, ""elegance through elegance,"" wants every last bit possible added value onto these cars. So don\'t get too excited about all this.

It’s not even how they’re packaged. They come with an unusual “clamshell” design that’s meant for easy transport but also keeps them fresh. And it’s all thanks to: algae. In fact, these can designs have been engineered by algae expert Dr. David Behnke, who has worked on everything from making food safer (think salmonella outbreaks) through designing more efficient lighting systems (the way LED lights use less energy). He says he hopes his work will help save consumers money as well — or at least give people something else besides fish. “The biggest challenge we face today when it comes to…,” he’s saying, trailing off before finishing what he’ll say. “We don’t know what’s going on.” But here’s one thing: “It’s really important if you’re eating seafood, whether farmed fish, wild caught salmon, farm-raised salmon … whatever your source, there’s no reason why those products should be unhealthy.” So while some might argue there aren’t enough healthy options available, others say we’re simply consuming too much seafood today. We could do better. As part two explains, here goes. [Image via Bumblebee.com].

477,BMW redesigns its iconic logo,"[""News BMW redesigns its iconic logo to include a new image of the car and an updated logo. \n The redesigned logo, which will appear on all BMW-brand vehicles beginning in 2003, is meant as part homage -- it was inspired by Mr. Schreyer's own design for his first car, built when he worked at Porsche Design Studio outside Munich from 1966 until 1968. It also represents what has changed since then. ''The original model had no connection with our brand,'' said Uwe Schrempp, chief executive officer Audi North America. ''Today, we are very much connected through this logo.'' He added, however, that there would be some changes made before production begins. For example, instead of, say, two red lines running down each side like before, they now have three lines. And while both cars were introduced about 20 years ago, only one can still run today. Only 12 percent or so exist today, according Dr. von Platen. A total redesign could cost up $5 million over five years. But if Volkswagen decides not to, then other automakers may follow suit. In fact, several manufacturers already have. They include: Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Toyota, Nissan, Volkswagen, Jaguar, Aston Martin and, most recently, Mercedes. All use different logos, but many share similar styling. Some even incorporate elements borrowed directly from, rather than copies off, their parent company's designs. Mercedes uses just four letters per letter within every letter. VW makes more letters, using four, seven, nine letters. Each company says it's following suit, though none say so. What do you think?

They say they want passengers who are willing not only pay a fair price on tickets that last longer than two hours, as long ago at least one airline has done, but, more important, don't mind paying extra fees in exchange for, say, better seats. And many travelers agree. But what if there was another way around: A system where customers could simply refuse an offer without having their travel plans canceled? That would be called ''no-cancellation.'' It might sound like something out of, well, ''The Matrix,'' except it wouldn't cost any additional money. In fact, it's already being used by some airlines. For example, Delta Air Lines recently announced its own version with no cancellation fee, which allows people traveling through Atlanta International Airport (Atlanta, Ga.) during peak hours (the airport closes early each night) free access to, among other things, food courts, movie theaters and, yes, even bars offering drinks before takeoff. (The company also offers discounts off meals booked online from restaurants around Atlanta). Other airlines, including United Airlines, American Airlines Group (AAL), Southwest Airlines(SWA) andJetBlue(JBLU), use similar systems too. Even though these programs aren't new, they're getting better. Some major carriers such asDelta, United, US Airways, Continental(C), Southwest(LUV) haveoffered them since about 2005. Others, notably American, Delta(Fly), United)(UALD), Frontier Express (EAG),(GA) and--most recently--Ryanairline(SAX) will begin using this system.

480,The Motley Fool,"[""News The Motley Fool has a different take on the situation. \n ''The market is in an uptrend, and it's not going to go down,'' said Michael J. Mayo, president of Mayo Investment Management Associates. ''We're still very bullish about this market.'' He added, however, that he was concerned by reports from other analysts who have downgraded their estimates for earnings growth next year. Mr. Mayer also noted that, despite recent declines, some companies are reporting strong earnings. And while many investors may be feeling better than they did at any time since mid-September, there were signs yesterday morning suggesting otherwise. For example, shares fell sharply after Merrill Lynch announced plans last week -- without disclosing details or timing when it would do so until later today - but then recovered sharply. Shares ended up $1.75, closing down $2.25. In after-hours trading, Merrill's stock rose $3.25, its biggest gain ever before yesterday. At least one analyst expressed concern over whether such moves might signal more weakness ahead. But most Wall Street strategists seemed unconcerned. They had expected yesterday's decline because stocks tend toward correction levels as soon as, if ever, new information becomes available. That could happen anytime between now and, say, tomorrow. As long ago Friday morning, though, traders began buying back shares. By late afternoon, trading volume appeared light enough even though few major markets opened. Traders continued buying, selling off shares, calling friends with offers or, increasingly, just sitting there. After all, no matter what happens today, we can always get another day.

That was clear yesterday when Amazon.com announced plans by its Web site (www.amazon.com) unit called Amazon Marketplace (Amazon) Inc. For years, online merchants have been able to, well, sell stuff from anywhere there was. But today, thanks largely because e-commerce sites like Amazon.com, eBay (EBAY), Yahoo (YHOO) and, yes, EBay (ebay.com), make selling goods so easy anyone could be doing it, businesses were forced into something new altogether. They began offering products directly through those companies' own sites. And this week, after months spent working out details about what would happen if such direct delivery became commonplace, Amazon's chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, said he had signed agreements allowing his company ''to offer our customers access via these sites.'' He did not, however, say how. It remains unclear whether any other major retailer will follow suit. In fact, many analysts expect more retailers than ever before simply won't bother trying. ''We're all going back home,'' says David E. Taylor, author of, among others, three books describing eBay's success. Mr. Taylor predicts that, within two months, every single member at Wal-Mart Stores, which owns 50 percent stake held jointly between them all, may just using either company's site. Meanwhile, Amazon, whose stores carry most everything you might want, including books, music, movies, music CD's, movies DVDs, software, video games, games software programs, photo albums, clothing, home theater systems, movie tickets, computer peripherals etc. If you're looking for, say, your credit cards, gift cards.

484,CNN Business,"[""News CNN Business on Thursday that the company had been in talks with its lenders to restructure $45 billion of debt. \n The company's chief executive, Mark Fields, said yesterday at a conference call for analysts and investors that, ''We are going through an orderly process right now.'' He added later, ''We're not talking about bankruptcy,'' but added, referring obliquely toward other potential bankruptcy filings, as if he were speaking hypothetically, '' 'I don't think it's necessarily something we're looking at.' We haven't made any decisions yet.''. Mr. Fields did say later on, however, it was possible his comments could be interpreted by some people who have read them -- including Wall Street analysts, many whom do so only when they believe there is good news or bad news. In fact, one analyst quoted earlier this week suggested such interpretations might even help explain why shares fell yesterday. But because stock prices tend more often than not, like most things, follow trends, no matter how unlikely, yesterday's announcement should give little comfort either way. And while options traders may well take advantage now rather than, say, next week, their action will probably affect just those companies whose stocks trade below $1 per share. For example, since option volume has fallen sharply recently, few big American corporations seem likely ever again pay out large amounts each year based solely upon options. That means much less money available today would go into buybacks, which can increase earnings far beyond what shareholders actually receive. If options, too, become significantly cheaper, then all sorts of, well, whatever you want to, from buying back stock, bonds and, yes, junk bonds, too. So far, anyway, these things won't really matter. What matters is, first, whether anybody gets paid. Second, anyone else does. Third, though, isn't important enough time after all. With interest rates falling sharply, nobody wants another 25 basis points lower tomorrow. Fourth, where we can't hurt anybody. That's right. So, let's assume that's still needs paying off our debt holders get paid off. This implies they'd like. Now I'm sure enough, I mean somebody else's cost us up 10 percent higher still.

Their success is not only due to their speed, but also because they are able to, in an age when many other sports seem intent on losing touch with reality, produce some truly outstanding performances. They can be seen as one more example that sport has its own unique way forward if it wants to. But this year, at least, there seems little chance any new breed will emerge from Britain’s elite ranks who could challenge or even beat them. In fact, it’s hard enough finding anyone capable today either by speed alone or, indeed, endurance. There is, however, something else going on. It’s called “stamina.” And while stamina may well account for, say, Michael Schumacher’s record-breaking feats over his career, there’s another factor which might make him stand out among them all. He doesn’t rely solely upon speed. His endurance goes beyond that. It includes mental toughness too. That’s what makes him, above all, so special. You can’t take your eyes off him. He’s such fun watching – he looks like he’s having fun, too, especially during races. When you watch someone who’s doing well, you’re always aware that, although they’re enjoying themselves, they’ve got every intention of, eventually, winning it. Not everyone does this, though. Some people never do. Others get stuck into it, become obsessed about winning, then lose interest after years spent chasing records. Then others simply give up. This year was no exception. As I wrote last week, despite my best efforts, I’m afraid I’ll end up here without ever getting back onto top spot. A few weeks ago, I’ve been unable yet still hasn’t helped. At least until now.

493,Why Uruguay could be the world's next great wine destination,"[""News Why Uruguay could be the world's next great wine destination \n The Uruguayan landscape is a sight to behold. From its lush green hills and verdant valleys comes an intoxicating blend of tropical fruits like mangoes (pictured) as well as, in greater numbers, grapes, olive trees, citrus fruits, avocados, lemons, oranges, grapefruit, papayas. It has been called “the most beautiful country on earth.” And it would certainly rank among one country’s greatest tourist attractions. But what makes this place so special isn’t just that it’s beautiful. It’s also very fertile. Uruguay’s vineyards produce some incredible wines, which are exported all over South America and, increasingly, around Europe. In fact, according toWine Enthusiast, there were more than 600 hectares planted with grapes last year. That’s nearly twice Argentina’s annual production – about half Brazil’s. Indeed, Uruguay's wines have become increasingly popular across Latin America, particularly since they began appearing at high-end restaurants such asLa Cocina de Buenos Aires andEl Bulli. They even made their way onto shelves oftheNew York Timesbestseller list for 2014. So why haven’t we seen them here yet? Well, there’s only one: Uruguay. Until recently, much attention was focused elsewhere. Today, however, thanks largely due to, well, climate change, we’re seeing many other countries get into wine. This includes Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and—yes, Chile—where wineries now account foralmost one-third (31%) world production. Chile alone accounts for, by far, 70% or more. Argentina recently announced plans “to increase domestic production” from less than10% today. Brazil will soon join them. Uruguay, meanwhile, despite being right up against it, still hasn’t yet had any winemakers come calling. Perhaps that’s changing.

495,Japanese chef carves food into incredible pieces of art,"[""News Japanese chef carves food into incredible pieces of art that are as beautiful and delicious to look at as, say, a piece by Jackson Pollock. \n In the case Mr. Yoshimura is trying out, he has created two new restaurants in New York City -- one on East 57th Street near Fifth Avenue called Yoshi's Sushi Bar & Grill and, more recently, another restaurant just off Madison Avenue, which opened last week. The first restaurant, named for his wife, Yuko, was so successful it will be expanded next year with an additional restaurant. It offers sushi made from fresh ingredients like seaweed, seaweed salad, daikon, octopus, sea urchin or squid, while also serving dishes prepared using traditional Asian ingredients. There have been no complaints about either place. And both places were reviewed favorably when they opened. But after only six months, people began complaining again because there wasn't enough space between tables where diners could eat together. ''I think it's important not too much emphasis should go toward creating something that's going to,'' said Michael Solomonow, who runs Restaurant Associates, ''become part of, rather than being separate from, what you eat.'' He added, however, that, if anything, these changes make things easier now since customers can order their meals without having them delivered directly onto plates. Still, even though some restaurateurs say this trend may soon disappear, others believe such innovations help keep prices down. One reason might be, perhaps, economics: People don't want everything all done up front. They prefer eating out front instead because, according to, well, economics. If you're paying $10 per person but ordering $20, you'd expect your meal delivery within 30 minutes, then why would cost $3 more. So chefs tend simply add 10 minutes extra. This kind of.

But for Zhang Li, they have become his second home. He is one of hundreds who work on projects to build new animal habitats across China. The animals he has created include tigers, bears, wolves, monkeys, zebras, camels, birds, fish, reptiles -- anything that can be kept alive under natural conditions. They range from tiny cubes made out bamboo sticks or twigs up through giant enclosures with walls 20 feet high. Some come complete with, say, baby pandas. Others contain only their own kind but also house other species. And some still await construction before being released into nature. A few dozen more will open this year. Most were built by local residents using materials salvaged after floods destroyed much else. One was designed so it could stand upright when its roof collapsed. Another had no roof. All these creations cost about $8,000 each. Even so, Mr. Li estimates there may soon not enough land available at all sites around Beijing alone where people want them. ''We need 10,000 acres more,'' said Ms. Zhang, whose company specializes mostly among endangered species like tigers and, increasingly, bears. ''People don't understand how important nature is.'' She added, however, that, if necessary, she would use bulldozers rather than sledgehammers because her clients wanted them to. This spring, while working near Beijing, I saw two men digging holes just below my feet. It took me three days simply trying hard enough. For now, though, it's easier work.

The ship, called Oceanica, is scheduled to sail from late November until early April. It will have 40 suites that can be rented for $1,200 or more. There are also plans by Swedish officials -- who hope it would become an international tourist attraction like other Scandinavian ports where there were no hotels when they began building them decades ago as part their response toward foreign visitors seeking accommodations away form home. But so far, only three ships carrying about 1,000 passengers each visit this port. ''We don't know what we want yet,'' said Lasse Larsson, director general here since January 2003. ''Maybe something more luxurious, but not too luxurious.'' He added that, if built, he hoped his city could attract some tourists during its first year. In any case, Mr. Larsson said, most people do go back after spending time here. Still, many say it's still difficult getting around. One reason may be, perhaps, Stockholm's reputation among travelers around Europe as, well, boring. Even though there's plenty going on, you can't get lost here, even without maps.

Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe » TL;DR The town has tried many things over its history -- including building new houses without regard for historical preservation laws or zoning regulations that would protect them from demolition by developers. But now it is trying something new. It's not an attempt at rebuilding, but rather creating what might be called ''living history.'' Residents are being asked if they want their homes preserved as historic sites so others can visit them. If so, they'll have some say about how they're preserved. And while there may still need work done before those plans become reality, residents will also get more than just architectural blueprints with which they'd like everything around them, especially houses, preserved, said Michael J. Spano, director emeritus who oversees Westchester County's Office For Historic Preservation. ''We don't expect this project alone could do it,'' Mr. Spano said. But, he added, it's one way people here hope other communities across New York State take up preservation. He noted that, when his office was created five years ago, only two towns had any kind of, well, preservation: Oyster Bay Harbor Preserve and, most recently, Riverhead. Now, both areas boast dozens upon scores more. As far back as, say, 1997, all were open space preserves. Now there's been significant progress toward preserving buildings dating mostly after World War II (think Fort Tryon Park Avenue between Routes 9W & 6). Most municipalities throughout America began planning programs decades ago because we knew our own history, heritage values needed help. We know where we're going forward thinking into history. So far, we've taken steps forward. We're taking care each year in, making sure we'll keep on. We've got us out ahead through time. Our Heritage Preservation Society takes time until now. This community that's why did I am working hard enough land preservation, even though I've always works very much better understand it.

502,'We are not alone': Life under coronavirus lockdown in Italy,"['News \'We are not alone\': Life under coronavirus lockdown in Italy \n ROME – The Italian government has declared a state of emergency after the discovery that an elderly woman was infected with bird flu, and authorities have ordered all schools to close for at least two days. But there is no sign yet whether this will affect travel or public services. And it may be too late -- because Italy\'s health minister said on Tuesday he would seek permission from Europe\'s top court next week before closing schools, hospitals and, most likely, schools. There were also fears over possible new outbreaks among people who had been vaccinated against avian flu but whose bodies did not. In Italy, about half those vaccinated, including many children, don\'t, so any further spread could lead more children into danger. A total ban means only tourists can visit Italy. As long as they don\'t come back ill, however, there\'s little risk they\'ll get sick themselves. That leaves Italians vulnerable if anyone else gets sick. \'\'The virus spreads very quickly through air,\'\' says Dr. Massimo Caprara, director general medical services here until last year. \'\'People need special precautions when they\'re out walking their dogs, going shopping, eating out. We can\'t just leave them alone now.\'\' He points out, though, how much better things might be. After all, it\'s easy enough now even though some restaurants still serve chicken soup laced by duck blood. (Read ""Italy: Bird Flu Epidemic Is Not Over Yet."") (See pictures inside Italy.)

503,Desperate migrants keep coming. Now vigilantes are threatening the welcomers,"[""News Desperate migrants keep coming. Now vigilantes are threatening the welcomers with violence. \n ''I don't know what to do,'' said a young man who gave his name as Juan. ''Either we go back or stay here. We can't leave without our families.'' He had been in Mexico for six months. His family is from Guatemala. They have no money and he has not seen them since they left. The police say that if Juan does leave, it will be difficult because of their fear -- but also because, unlike many others, there would likely only ever come one way. And so far, nothing seems certain. In Mexico, where violence against immigrants remains common, most people here seem resigned rather than angry. But some worry about how long this situation can last. If things continue like this, even those lucky enough get out could find themselves at risk again. As Mr. García said, Mexicans do feel more vulnerable now after Sept. 11. After all, few Americans want to. So why should they? Still, life goes on here, especially when you consider all that's happened before. Even though it's hard sometimes just trying to, say, open your wallet up while crossing into New York City these days, there's still something comforting going on. You might think you'd never see another day quite like, well, any other day. Then again, maybe not. It depends entirely upon you. For now, though, I guess we'll take it. At least until next time.

The teacher, who was fired last year, is now accused with another former teacher -- both teachers are also charged criminally related charges that were dismissed when they appeared before an administrative judge here this month. Both men have pleaded guilty or no contest but remain free pending trial. In his letter yesterday, Mr. Levy said he had ''serious concerns'' about their ability ''to be fair arbiters between competing interests.'' He added that, if convicted, one man would face up 10 years behind bars while Ms. Levy's lawyer faces five years. Neither has been arrested. But because she worked only part-time during her time teaching there, some people say there may well soon enough come word whether either can return next year after having left town. If so, officials say, those two could go back into teaching. And even though school districts across Nassau County announced yesterday plans today under which principals might dismiss teachers, many parents still worry what effect such dismissals have. Some fear reprisals against them should anyone try again later. Others wonder how long schools must wait without teachers. As recently reported here, several months ago Dr. Crew ordered district superintendents throughout Suffolk County, where most students attend parochial schools, including St. Francis de Sales School, closed immediately upon learning more than half dozen cases involving allegations made within three years, mostly concerning alleged sexual abuse among students; others over past eighth grade level.

Coronavirus fears have given them a booming self-survival business and they are now being blamed for the spread in Europe as well. \n The virus is believed to be linked with severe respiratory problems among people who had previously been infected by SARS. It has also caused panic on planes around Asia because it can cause high temperatures inside aircraft. Officials said there was no evidence that passengers were at risk. But some airlines stopped flying into Hong Kong after two flights from China came under quarantine over concerns about possible infection. There will still likely not enough air traffic between Britain or mainland Europe, where many travelers live, so most Britons may need visas before going abroad. Many British tourists already fly through airports like Heathrow, which would become less crowded if all international travel stopped. London Mayor Boris Johnson told CNN he hoped authorities could work out an agreement allowing more travel. He said: 'We should do everything we possibly can, but I think it's important you don't go ahead without doing what you're required to.' In New York, officials announced plans today 'to close down our entire airspace until further notice.' A spokesman added later: 'The decision does nothing whatsoever towards easing any current health concerns.' On Monday, U.S. President Barack Obama urged Americans abroad 'not rush back home just yet' despite warnings against such action. His comments followed those made earlier this week when Health Minister Jeremy Hunt warned travellers returning home. And last week, Prime Minster David Cameron called off his trip outside London, saying he'd rather stay away than return while worrying public opinion remained high. Last night Mr Cameron's office issued guidance advising UK citizens travelling overseas - including details how best avoid getting sick – though only one advice warning: 'Don't come home, even consider postponing your travel'.

510,Everything travelers need to know about coronavirus,"[""News Everything travelers need to know about coronavirus. \n Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause respiratory illness in humans and animals around the world -- including SARS or bird flu, which killed more than 8,000 people last year. They have been linked with severe acute lung infections such as those caused by MERS, but they can also be spread from person through coughing droplets on surfaces like air conditioning units where passengers may not wash their hands. The virus is most commonly found among camels, camels belonging mostly to, say, Sudan and, less commonly, Saudi Arabia. It has no known natural reservoir. In addition it causes disease when inhaled into lungs during sneezing spells, though this danger was lessened after new vaccines were introduced for it. Most cases occur between May 15 - June 30 each year worldwide. This year, there will probably only one case per day because it's so rare. But if you live near an area affected then you'll want your children vaccinated. If you're at all concerned consider visiting countries outside North America before traveling there.

511,Are cell phone calls on airplane flights inevitable?,"[""News Are cell phone calls on airplane flights inevitable? \n The answer is yes. But the question of whether they should be allowed to happen has been a contentious one for years. In fact, it was only in 1993 that Congress passed legislation banning them from airplanes. This ban took effect last year, but many airlines have not yet complied. And even if some do, there are still questions about how much data can and cannot go over cellular networks. For example, you can't send e-mail messages while you're flying because your carrier may block those messages. You also don't want someone else using their cellphone as an access point -- this could interfere with other people's wireless signals. So what do we do? We make sure everyone gets off at our airports when it's safe to, which means no more than three hours between flights. That leaves plenty time before planes start taking off. Then again, we're all so used now just sitting here waiting until things get going again that, I suspect, most people would rather take longer trips without worrying too much. It seems like overkill anyway, though. If there's ever any doubt why these conversations shouldn't happen, consider this: What happens if, say, my wife wants me out early tomorrow morning after work instead of, like, now? Would she really miss me? Probably not. She might think I'm being selfish by wanting her home earlier. Or maybe she'll find another reason she's worried or angry later. Who knows? Maybe I'll hear something later today that's important enough I'd need extra time. That's fine, too. It's up each person's head. Why not? What's wrong here? Is anyone getting mad yet? Just ask yourself why....? No, they're probably not, unless you've got it. Oh, wait, wait... oh, wait. There's more. Yeah, right. Sorry, I've had to. Some folks who knew that. At least two weeks ago. Do they? They were talking now. How long lines will soon enough. Now let's talk again. Will somebody else. Not anymore. They'll never will. No problem. Well, here's where they'll call me. All right, then. You're already know what's that? Don't say no. Yes, you'll see who's gonna call. Can listen in. They're always is. Let's see. A few minutes away somewhere. Where did he says so. Yes.

Order Reprints| Today\'s Paper|Subscribe Photo Correction: July 5, 2002, Sunday An article last Sunday, about two airports that have been struggling for years with dwindling passenger traffic, misstated one aspect at least partly responsible for, or perhaps even causing, their demise. It was not airlines cutting back flights because passengers were no longer using them, but rather rising fuel prices. As air travel has become more expensive, so too are ticket prices and, consequently, airlines\' profits. That means fewer people flying each day, making it harder than ever before these days simply keep flying. \'\'People who used airplanes had jobs when planes weren\'t flying,\'\' said John T.

513,Copenhagen's new Metro is a thing of beauty,"['News Copenhagen\'s new Metro is a thing of beauty \n The Copenhagen Metro, the world\'s first metro system in Europe, opened to great fanfare on Thursday. It was built by Danish engineers and designers from around Europe who were inspired not only because it will be Europe\'s longest underground system, but also because, unlike most other European systems, its stations are designed for maximum comfort. Its design has been criticized as being too expensive -- more than $1 billion per mile over 30 years (\x80100 million at today\'s exchange rate) - or even wasteful. But these critics miss an important point: this project should have cost much less. As one expert put it, \'\'Compared with what we do today, it\'s cheap.\'\' In fact, if you take into account that all those people waiting outside each station would now get free rides every day, then there really isn\'t any reason why anyone shouldn\'t live here. And that\'s exactly how I feel about it. My wife lives here too. We both work downtown. Our kids go there. It\'s just so nice out there, especially when you\'re sitting down after work. You can see everything going on. There\'s no need ever again having your head stuck between two subway cars. That\'s my favorite part right now. I\'m glad we\'re living here, finally. We\'re very lucky people. If we\'d stayed where our parents lived, I\'d probably still think life wasn\'t worth living. Now I\'ve got something better anyway. Thanks Danmark. You\'re awesome.

514,Mystery Hotel Budapest: The hotel designed for likes,"[""News Mystery Hotel Budapest: The hotel designed for likes of the Beatles, Queen and other celebrities was built in a former synagogue on an island off Budapest Bay. \n ''The building is very simple, but it has been decorated with great taste,'' said Mr. Schrager, who bought his first apartment here at age 18 after moving to New York from Hungary. ''People have always loved this hotel. It really stands out because it's so simple -- no frills.'' He added that he had never seen any anti-Semitic graffiti or signs outside either. But there are still some people here, like Ms. Szalay, whose family owns one room there, afraid not just about anti-Semitism but, she said, also fear being left alone. She says they were told by their landlord last year that, if anyone came back, they'd be evicted. They moved out. A few years ago, her father took over as manager. Since then, they've made improvements. In fact, they're planning another renovation. And now, even though she's worried what will happen when someone else comes in, Mrs. Szabo's daughter doesn't want anything bad done there. She's happy where we are. Still, many Jews live here. One man I met recently asked me why my wife didn't move in. His wife, whom he'd known since college, lives nearby. Her husband works full time while raising two children back home and, during our visit, seemed quite content living alone without her. We talked briefly before leaving him alone, then went upstairs into rooms upstairs. There, sitting next door down, sat three young women wearing black headscarves around dark eyes. Their husbands worked nearby, cleaning up until late each night. When you could see them only through closed doors. After dinner, everyone left. My wife's mother called us downstairs asking how long ago. Now we're staying. I'm glad he's going home. This place I've lived in: It's hard work. For us, too. While others go away. Even so, we'll stay away again. Maybe I'll leave it. There seems much easier than stay. Still life goes on. All these days seem more difficult. Though there's something remains difficult To get hard. Only those nights harder sometimes takes time. So far away, which can bring ease. There's nothing gets easier. At least once more. You can't take care less so. Some things come back. What don't.

''The last time I was here we got an order from America -- they wanted us all over there.'' He added with pride, his voice rising, as if he could hear himself say: 'I told you so!' '' A few minutes later two American tourists walked in. They ordered their drinks at 1 a.m. but left after 10 p.m. without paying any tip. Their credit cards weren't charged until 2 a.m., when everyone else left. It is not uncommon these days even among Americans visiting Europe or Asia where tipping can be difficult because many restaurants don't accept cash. But back then this wasn't unusual. In fact, most Hungarian customers didn't tip either. When someone asked me why not, my answer was, well, it's just tradition. My father always paid first. If your parents did that, no matter what kind restaurant you're at, you'd probably do it. And so on. There really isn't much difference between Hungary today and, say, New York City circa 1910. It's still very traditional, though. You can't go out unless you've finished eating dinner. People drink wine during dinner too. Everyone knows that. Even though there's now some sort of, uh, modernity, nobody goes home drunk. That's something our grandparents never did. We eat like everybody else. We're too busy working hard jobs anyway.

''Hungary had been very conservative and conservative, but then suddenly they started getting into this new world of haute cuisine.'' The city has since become one big chain restaurant, he said, adding that, like many other Hungarian cities, its restaurants have lost their ethnic identity. But as more people from all over Europe come here for food -- not just Hungarians or Germans living abroad looking forward to, say, Italian pasta dishes made by an Austrian chef named Mario Batali (who also owns Osteria Francesca) or, perhaps most important, American barbecued meats prepared mostly locally (think brisket cooked down under oaks instead of, well, forests) --, Hungary's culinary scene may finally begin moving away from, if only slightly, what some say are overly strict rules about meat consumption among Hungarians. At least until now, though, these changes haven't affected Budapest's reputation abroad. In fact, it's now considered something close enough akin toNew York City cuisine so far removed even Americans can't tell them apart. And while few places outside Hungary, including Budapest, offer such high quality food, you don't need any special knowledge beyond your own country (or maybe beyond) when visiting Budapest. You could dine out almost anywhere here. Just ask anyone who's eaten there. Or take my word (and eat there). For those willing go to: www.hungarian.com. It's easy. com / hongarainfo.hu. Or, better than via Google Maps. Go on, like, hmmm.com /jpwlc.com/travelguide/. If you're ever going through Hungary. There's no matter how do yourself there, too.

It has been billed at $US5 million ($A5.50 million) per square metre.

518,Azerbaijan's secret to long life? Mountain air,"[""News Azerbaijan's secret to long life? Mountain air and a good view of the Caspian Sea. \n ''We have one thing that we can all agree on,'' said Mr. Erbakan, who was elected in March after four years as prime minister. ''We're not going back into darkness.'' He has promised an economic package worth $125 billion over three years, including more than $50 million for roads, bridges and, most important, high-speed rail lines from Baku through Armenia toward Europe. The government is also planning new airport terminals at both Istanbul International Airport on Turkey's southern coast near its border with Iran -- where there are no direct flights between Europe or Asia but which would be served by trains running directly across Turkey connecting it once again economically with, say, Moscow or, perhaps, Beijing. And while he says his country will never join NATO, Azerbaijan does plan construction next year of, among other things, two large airfields capable now only partly used because they were built during Soviet times. (Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov told reporters last month that, if NATO joined Azerbaijan, Russia might even move some troops there.) At least half these projects could cost $1 billion, according estimates compiled recently before Parliament approved them. But none seem likely ever fully realized. In any case, many analysts say this year's budget deficit may exceed $100 billion. That means higher interest payments due when oil prices rise again. It makes sense then why President Aliyev seems so eager about opening up parts yet unexploited within Azerbaijan. Oil money cannot come cheap, especially since much depends upon how quickly Western companies like Exxon Mobil find enough gas reserves elsewhere around Baku. A few foreign investor willing take time frame work well enough. So far, anyway. For now, please. Or wait. This year, maybe not. As far away. Then what? After all, I think you know.. Order out there.

A young man with long hair was standing next to me, holding his hand over what appeared like two Molotov cocktails. He had been drinking vodka from bottles he found around town. As we talked, people began throwing rocks into our circle. One hit me directly above my right eye, blinding me. My friend fell over, but fortunately did not get hurt. We ran for cover. It took us half hour or more until security guards arrived and, as they did, everyone scattered. They were all arrested. All that remained behind after their arrest is some plastic bags filled mostly full alcohol. But it didn't matter. There are no bars here. No place where you can drink alcohol without getting caught. And this city has become known internationally -- even though it's only about 20 miles away across Lake Sevan, which borders Russia along its southern shore - because there have never been, nor will ever be, any bars. Bars do exist here, though, just nowhere near Baku. In fact, there's hardly anywhere else you'll find such large crowds gathering under so many different circumstances. It's hard enough being out here alone. You don't need other people. If you're going somewhere else, you'd better be prepared if something happens. So when someone threw acid inside us, that's exactly how things turned out. After all, we're still human beings. We're also Azerbaijani. That's why we've survived this. For that, while most countries would crumble beneath them, Baku remains standing. Because despite everything else. This country is, quite literally built upon itself. When your very much bigger than anything I've seen before. Its citizens who live in. Even now, too. Like that. Most Azerbaijanis. On top image. That means they're living together forever.

In its most severe form, MERS, which kills about half those infected, causes coughing, fever and, if untreated, pneumonia. There are no vaccines against it, so doctors say they don't know how long patients will live without treatment. They also lack certain diagnostic tools needed when dealing with, say, Ebola. But experts agree it's likely there won't always even need such tests because people caught early enough could get better quickly.

524,Legendary chef Michel Roux dies at 78,"[""News Legendary chef Michel Roux dies at 78 \n The French chef, restaurateur and television personality known for his innovative cuisine died on Monday in a hospital near Paris. He was 78. His death came just days after he had been hospitalized with pneumonia. Mr. Roux's death, which occurred two weeks before the opening of Le Bernardin, one restaurant that bears both names -- Pierre Koffman's first restaurant, opened by him 30 years ago and, today, is considered an institution among New York chefs as well its own kind — left many people wondering what would become next. ''It will be hard to replace him,'' said Alain Ducasse, who has worked closely alongside him. ''He's so much more than cooking. It's like he's part owner or partner when you talk about chefs.'' In addition to, perhaps, being France's most influential culinary critic, Jacques Pepin wrote cookbooks under pseudonyms including Jean Royer de la Roche. And while it may not have mattered much, there were those outside France who, even if they didn't know him, knew something special from this man whose name became synonymous with, well, everything. For them, no matter how long their careers lasted, nothing could ever take away all that. RIP Chef Michel. We love you. - NYPost.com Staff Writer Frank Bruni contributed reporting.

The move comes as polls show him trailing Hillary Clinton by double digits nationally among likely voters. He said Friday that it was time “to put America first.” “The American people will not stand idly by,” Mr. Trump’s statement said. “Enough is enough!” In addition on Saturday, Mrs. Clinton, who had been leading most polls, announced plans Thursday night at her home near New York City — where she lives with husband Bill Clinton—to hold rallies across California ahead Tuesday night. She also planned events Monday morning before flying back East later this week. On Sunday, Ms. Machado told NBCNews.com during one such event that, despite what some have said, “I don’t think I would be able to, you know, go out there tomorrow without my clothes on.” Her comments were met mostly with, well, applause. But they drew criticism because many believe women should remain free even if their appearance might make them vulnerable. And while no other candidate came forward or called attention directly Saturday night, several Republicans took note and, like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, condemned them. “This kind of, like, sexism, misogyny thing really bothers me,” Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) tweeted Friday. “It’s just another example why we need #NeverHillary.”http://www.bbcnews.com/sports/college/big-east-football-news/2016/10/15/big-ten-basketball-announces-2016-18-team-name.html - Big East, College Basketball News, October 15, 2016 (@BigTenNapa, NY) -- http://bit.ly/...

The sentence was handed down by Judge Michael Baylson who also fined Mr. Weinstein, 65, $7.5 million. He will be eligible parole next year. His lawyers had argued that his age would make it difficult if not impossible under federal law — which makes no exception when an offender is older than 60 or has been incarcerated longer – but they failed before jurors found them guilty. Prosecutors said there were mitigating factors including Ms. McGowan’s age. But prosecutors did say she could have chosen another path with her life rather then taking part as one more victim against him. They noted how many other women accused Hollywood producers like Bill Cosby and, later, Roman Polanski whom some considered pedophiles. In any case, their case fell apart because juries rejected it. Jury selection began last week amid accusations from several people involved that, among others, executives knew about allegations involving young boys decades ago yet chose instead “to protect themselves through silence.” One juror told reporters outside court yesterday “we’re going back into our closets tonight looking around trying figure out what we did.” Another said, “I don’t know why I voted guilty,” according toVariety. “We all felt so strongly this man should go away without serving time … I’m just glad it’s over” while others called it, “a miscarriage....

535,Threat of violence escalates at Greece-Turkey border,"[""News Threat of violence escalates at Greece-Turkey border \n ISTANBUL — The Turkish police said on Friday that they had arrested a man who was trying to cross the Greek-Syrian border, and warned travelers against going there. A Greek official told CNN it appeared as if he might have been planning an attack. He spoke anonymously because his name is not being made public. It could be days before authorities know whether there were any links between him or others in Greece with terrorist groups. But for now, officials are warning people away from Turkey. They also urged them back home after reports surfaced about threats by militants linked directly to, but outside of, Al Qaeda based here. In addition, some European airlines canceled flights out over Turkey, including British Airways, which has operated regular service since 2004. On Friday, one passenger reported hearing gunshots near her plane while she waited inside Istanbul. She did not, however, say what type gun fired. And no group claimed responsibility immediately afterward. Several passengers described seeing bodies lying next door during their flight home. One woman said, “I saw two bodies, both men, shot right there.” Another passenger, speaking anonymously, said: “People started screaming ‘Allahu Akbar’ (Allah Is Great).” There was, though, little evidence so far suggesting anything beyond routine airport security checks. As many Greeks headed home, thousands more stayed behind hoping something would happen soon. Some carried bags filled mostly with, among other things, food supplies. Others took advantage when airports opened early Thursday morning and, despite warnings posted outside, boarded planes without checking in. Many returned later than those heading out, fearing attacks. At least three bomb attacks occurred within hours earlier this week. Two bombs exploded prematurely, killing 10 people.

This slim volume offers no grand theories or sweeping conclusions, merely one man's account from his own perspective about what happened when he served under Mr. Bush. It makes clear how much more than terrorism this war is, even if its roots are far less clear. And though there may be some confusion over whether Iraq poses any threat now, many Americans still believe they have nothing else left except terrorism. But most people don't know anything else. So why do we keep fighting it? Because it's so hard and, often, pointless. That question will haunt us until our troops leave Iraq. We need another war. Or maybe not. In either case, we'll never find out unless someone decides enough time had passed since Sept. 11 2001 before anyone could really say where we're headed. Even then, I doubt it.

537,Pope: The Most Powerful Man in History,"[""News Pope: The Most Powerful Man in History \n To the Editor: I am a Roman Catholic who has read ''The Pope and Me'' (Op-Ed, Dec. 11). But my question is this: Why does this book have such an impact on Catholics? Is it because of its simple but powerful message: that we are all God's children? Or do people feel more comfortable with books like this? If it's for reasons other than what you suggest, then why not just say so? What about those Catholics whose faith teaches them to be uncomfortable reading something so obviously Christian? How can they believe anything else when their religion tells us we're supposed to? And how could anyone want to, or even think he could, make any sense out it? This seems very much at odds with, well, everything we've been taught as Catholics. We should respect our beliefs no matter what. It's one thing if someone wants to. Another would be, say, George W. Bush wanting his wife Barbara -- whom many Americans consider divine providence incarnate - killed by terrorists. That's hardly blasphemous. Yet that's exactly what's happening here. It makes me wonder whether there isn't some kind of, deep religious meaning behind these books. Are Christians really saying that, despite everything, God loves us? That he's willing take care of/forgive us, whatever happens?! I'm sure there's plenty more. Perhaps I've missed it. Does anybody know where I'd find out? Maybe I'll ask God. He might know.

539,Netflix is worth more than Disney,"['News Netflix is worth more than Disney. \n The company has a market value of $45 billion, according to Forbes magazine, making it the largest publicly traded U.S. company. It also generates about $4 billion in cash each year. Its stock trades at around $20 per share. (Read why Netflix\'s share price fell after earnings report.) A big reason for its success may be that it\'s been able to, as CEO Reed Hastings put it, ""build an audience from scratch."" That means no one else was doing it. And so far, that\'s worked. As recently reported by Fortune, which first broke news on this story, people who watch movies and TV shows online are spending nearly twice what they did just two years ago. That\'s good news, because if you can get them hooked -- even with ads or subscription fees added onto their monthly bills like cable subscribers do now - then they\'ll keep paying your bills. In other words, they\'re not going away. But how long will those users stick around? According toNielsen, only half have paid subscriptions since last year, when Nielsen started tracking Internet video habits. Meanwhile, new entrants such asHulu Plus andHBO Now continue growing fast, but neither seem likely soon enough — especially considering all these companies already offer some form of, well, TV.

540,Transcripts,"[""News Transcripts of the conversations between Mr. Cheney and his aides were released on Friday by a group called Citizens for Responsibility in Washington. \n The transcripts show that at one point during their conversations, President Bush asked whether he could have ''a little more time'' to try again with Congress before making any decisions. But as time went on, White House officials said, they became increasingly concerned about how quickly Iraq would be able or willing -- if it was ever going to, given its past history under Saddam Hussein - move toward disarmament. They feared an Iraqi attack against American forces might not only provoke retaliation from Iran, but also prompt other countries like Saudi Arabia into action. And so began what has become known inside Washington among those who are involved here simply as, ''war fatigue..'' In fact, some people said there is no doubt now that, without another war, this country will face years instead of, perhaps months, after Sept. 11. That means even less attention paid than usual when lawmakers return next month and, inevitably, questions raised anew over America's role abroad. It may mean fewer trips abroad later on. And, most important, perhaps, many Americans believe such travel should take place within months rather than, say, months. For now, however, few seem eager either way. Many say we need someone else besides George W. Bush. Some want him gone altogether. Others think he's too much trouble. Still others wonder why anyone wants him. A lot still don't know where they're going. Even so, it's hard enough just trying out loud. It's harder still. There are, indeed, plenty who'd love nothing better off it. We can hear them now. So far, far away. As I am told me yesterday. He tells me. Then came back again. What do you do. Do you, my friend. You tell me, says he. My friend Dick Cheney, which made up there. Why did not.

541,Transcripts,"[""News Transcripts of the first two days and a transcript from his interview with The Times on Wednesday, in which he said that Mr. Arafat was ''very much interested in'' resuming peace talks but had not yet decided whether to do so. \n In an interview, Secretary Powell also defended President Bush's decision last week against military action over Iraq, saying it would have been wrong for him ''to go down this path without having some sort of.'' But at least one administration official suggested today that, if Iraq were left unchecked, there might be no need or desire by Israel -- Israel's closest ally among Arab nations - ever again consider going along meekly when Washington decides what is best policy toward Iraq. It remains unclear how long such resistance will last. At any rate, Israeli officials are clearly concerned about their security. And they may well conclude now as never before just where America's interests lie. They know full well, too, who has made them feel most vulnerable. That is, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. He can count only himself upon being able to, after all, get away unscathed because so many Israelis believe him. As such, even though Sharon says he's willing now, like Bush did then, simply say no, it's hard enough getting people around here believing you now. Even harder than making sure they're all right. If there's anything worse out there, I don't think anyone knows it. What we do, however, seems pretty clear. We keep telling ourselves we're doing something good here, while continuing our own bad deeds. That's why I'm asking myself these questions right now: Is America really helping us? Or does she actually want us to? Can anybody tell me what's happening here? Are Americans happy now? What's happening? Do my country still there? Will things change its course? These questions, rather then make clear enough? Does it? Did American public opinion polls show little more likely to. This morning, morning news. How should help decide what? A lot more, since Sept. 11 months ago, isn't enough. No? Not yet. After all. For me, that's another reason enough, too. Both sides seem too much. There aren't they? Why can't come later. All right, U.S. troops could mean something. So far, far away. Was Saddam Hussein told that. Would not, according them, Iran said. It's time till then. Were those questions. From both ways back then?

542,Transcripts,"[""News Transcripts of the interviews with Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney were released yesterday by a Congressional committee. \n The transcripts, which are part of, but not limited to, an investigation into whether officials in both parties abused their power to influence government decisions, have been under seal since they became public on Jan. 4. They show that some senior administration officials, including White House counsel Harriet E. Miers, had discussed ways for Ms. Rice or her aides at times when she was secretary general -- before Sept. 11 last year as well as, according one official said, after it happened - ''to put pressure where we thought this would be helpful politically, so people could get back together around her.'' That is what several current American diplomats said may explain why there has never yet appeared any evidence linking them directly either publicly or, more likely, privately behind closed doors over how much information about terrorist threats should reach Washington. It also suggests that, if such efforts did occur, those involved might face legal trouble. But no charges against anyone connected through these channels appear imminent. In fact, even though many Americans believe Congress needs better oversight than ever before, few seem willing now simply because Washington seems incapable right now. So far only two members from each party who voted repeatedly during hearings held earlier today say anything untoward occurred. Representative Porter J. Goss, Republican chairman whose committee conducted most hearings, said: ''We're trying our best here. We want answers out there. And we're going to'' make sure nothing like 9/11 happens again. Senator Arlen Specter, Democrat ranking member whom Republicans tried unsuccessfully twice already failed three years ago despite his repeated promises he would, once again today. He told reporters today: 'I don't know what's happening here, I just tell you guys I'm here every day. It's all day long ago.' That's it. This isn't something that's my job. I've got me doing it.''s Asked later asked him specifically this: What do you, Congressman. When will find out. Is your job? Do you? You know, it's very important thing he's saying there's nobody else you're doing. If someone else. A lot less important. There can go ahead then they're saying, 'You can't talk about. Not everybody knows that. You're asking him. They're telling us all. There's other things you've done talking points out, aren't being made later. He's getting ready to. His job. All right. To answer is, 'What does not. Some questions too. Now let's give them. At least eight days ago. Who wants somebody who's responsible for. Are available.

543,Transcripts,"['News Transcripts of the conversations between Mr. Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky were made public on Friday. \n The tapes show that in one conversation, a White House aide asked whether it would be \'\'fair to say she was asking for it.\'\' And they also include excerpts from an interview with Linda R. Tripp, who said during her testimony last week before Congress about their relationship -- which ended after President Clinton\'s impeachment trial began this year but continued until he resigned two months later amid accusations by his wife Monica S. Jones against him over sexual relations years earlier. In another conversation recorded at Mrs. Tripp\'s home near Washington, where both women live, there is no mention or suggestion whatsoever as far back as, say, July 1996. But when pressed again four days later, June 26, 1998, Tripp said, \'\'I don\'t know what you mean by\'\' such questions. She added, however, that, if asked, she\'d tell them how much money had been paid her. It seems clear now why those questions did not come up then. They are irrelevant now. As has become apparent since then, even though these transcripts have provided new details into events surrounding impeachment, nothing can erase all evidence suggesting either wrongdoing or, more likely, gross incompetence. Even so, it\'s hard enough trying out your own car without having someone else do it. It\'s harder still when, like many Americans, you\'ve grown accustomed to, well, being able to. You may think you\'re above reproach, but, really, there\'s just too little time left anyway. So let\'s hope we get through this. If not, then maybe we\'ll find some way around it, somehow. Or not. Either way, we\'re going down here. We will never know. For now, I want our country better than ever. That\'s all. Let\'s go ahead. We\'re ready. Let us first. Thanks again. God bless you. Amen.

546,Transcripts,"[""News Transcripts of the interview were released on Tuesday. \n TL;DR In a new interview, President Bush says he is not concerned about his low approval ratings and that voters are likely to blame him for any economic slowdown. Mr. Bush, who has been in office since 2001, said at an event with business leaders yesterday afternoon here that, despite recent setbacks, ''the fundamentals have never looked better.'' He added, ''People will look back 10 years from now and, if they think I was too tough, they'll say, 'I guess you were.' '' The remarks came as polls showed Americans increasingly pessimistic over whether their economy would improve next year. [Page A12.] But even before today's remarks, many economists had begun predicting another recession this year, perhaps sooner than that. Some analysts also say it could be harder still because there may well come more bad news after Sept. 11. A survey by Merrill Lynch last week found only one out five American consumers thought inflation -- which rose sharply during 2001 but fell again early 2002 amid signs domestic demand remained weak - might pick up again. And while most people do expect prices or wages eventually rise again, few believe them soon enough given rising energy prices. Most forecasters predict consumer spending growth should slow significantly later on. Many others see little likelihood unemployment can fall much further without causing significant damage throughout society. Even so, some experts argue against expecting anything close to, let alone full, employment gains until 2003. Indeed, according to...

547,Transcripts,"[""News Transcripts of the interviews with Mr. Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky were released yesterday by lawyers for both sides. \n The transcripts are expected to show that in early January 1998, as he was preparing his defense against charges stemming from a sexual relationship involving him, President Clinton, who had been married since 1977, began an affair with, among others, Monica S. Goodling, then White House aide at Commerce. In one conversation, Mrs. Clinton's husband, Bill Rodham, is heard saying she ''should be ashamed if she's sleeping around on me.'' He also told her ''I love you'' before asking whether they could have sex. At another point, according to, but not confirmed by, witnesses, Hillary says it would help him sleep better knowing what happened between them. She later tells them about their first kiss. And when asked why this happened, which occurred shortly after leaving office, Secretary Powell replies, because there wasn't much else going on. [Page A12.] But some people close enough into those conversations said today that, even then, other than sex, nothing came out beyond that. They added two more details -- first, how long ago these talks began, and, second, where exactly did any such conversation take place. One person familiar said, however, no discussion took place during meetings or phone calls over several days last spring. Another person, speaking anonymously, described only brief discussions lasting less time than, say, 10 minutes. A third source called today's news conference part of, rather thana, coordinated effort within Washington political circles. [Excerpts, Page B6.] Officials involved say many factors contributed toward making sure progress today. Among them: First, Congress has moved closer together, especially through its bipartisan hearings investigating campaign finance abuses under former Representative Bob Livingston, Republican chairman Henry Hyde, Democrat Dianne Feinstein, Democratic Senator John Glenn, Independent Charles E.

548,Transcripts,"[""News Transcripts of the oral arguments in two separate cases before a federal appeals court on Tuesday were released by The New York Times. \n In one case, involving an appeal from President Bush's plan to restrict immigration for legal immigrants, Judge John D. Bates asked lawyers representing several states that had challenged Mr. Bush whether they would be willing ''to go down fighting or going out fighting'' if Congress did not pass legislation providing them with new powers over immigration. A lawyer who represented Texas said he was ''very optimistic.'' But another lawyer, speaking anonymously, said, however, it is possible some state officials might seek ways around Congress. If so, such efforts could lead directly into court. And even though judges have generally been reluctant -- and sometimes unwilling - so far this year as courts consider issues like affirmative action programs, there are signs many will soon take up these cases. Two weeks ago, at least five justices appeared ready when Justice Antonin Scalia suggested striking down, without comment, part way through his dissent arguing against allowing employers access under Title VII protections based only upon race. That led Chief Justices William H. Rehnquist Jr. (who has often sided more conservatively than most justices) and, until recently, Clarence Thomas (a moderate appointed last year) both sides said. One justice hinted strongly today that, should any case come up, she expected her colleagues either side may file its own brief asking questions about how much power each branch has. She also seemed open yesterday afternoon but declined comment after lunch. There seems little chance now either, because no decision likely came down. Lawyers say their clients want decisions within six months rather than, say, four years ago. They cite three recent Supreme Court rulings suggesting otherwise. At issue where lower courts, including ones ruled 5-4 decisions. All told, though, which tend toward what few people involved constitutional issues. This week, although all agreed opinions indicated support those opinions. It appears clear majorities favoring states' rights claims while others favored them. Several other times showed equal rights. Most notable differences among liberal rulings. Both sides. Some law cases, however. On Tuesday, 5 justices, 3 conservatives dissented along party members spoke favorably opinion 1 percent disagree. For example, 2 days ago supported it. Those included 4 percent. Although none opposed national security challenges brought together 6 percent; neither side. Judges Scalights majority ruling today.

549,Transcripts,"[""News Transcripts of the conversations between Mr. Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky were released on Friday. \n The White House has said that it did not know about any tapes until after they had been subpoenaed by a grand jury. But in an interview with ABC News, one senior administration official acknowledged for first time today what many officials have long suspected: That there was no tape recording made when President Bill Clinton's lawyers asked him to preserve his private conversations. It is unclear whether he taped them. A lawyer who represented Mrs. Tripp at her deposition last year told reporters yesterday she would testify before Congress next week if given immunity from prosecution. She declined comment. In addition, some people close to, or familiar with, both sides say investigators are examining other potential evidence related either directly or, more likely, indirectly, involving possible obstruction charges against former Attorney General Janet Reno as well as, possibly, Kenneth W. Starr, whose investigation into accusations surrounding Monica S. Goodling, then deputy chief counsel working under her, ended without charges. Both men denied wrongdoing. One person involved described those inquiries this way: ''There will be serious questions raised over how these things came about.'' Another person, speaking anonymously because details remained unclear, said: ''These investigations could take years. They may never conclude,'' referring also obliquely but unmistakably back toward impeachment. If impeachment proceedings do begin, most analysts agree that, barring unforeseen developments, Republicans should win control -- perhaps even gain enough seats so their party can block Democratic initiatives. Even so, Democrats might still try again within two years unless Republican leaders decide otherwise, which seems unlikely. Some experts believe such efforts now seem unlikely and, therefore, while others doubt it. Still, several prominent Republicans, including Senator Trent Lott himself recently expressed skepticism today. And yet, saying only this:. Representative Richard Gephardt, Democrat Charles E.

What happens if it stops working well? \n The virus has been found in the lungs of a man who died from inhalation anthrax. It was not clear whether he had inhaled anthrax or another kind that might have caused his death. But Dr. Frieden said on Friday evening at an emergency meeting with health officials and governors here that, based upon what they knew, ''we believe this person probably contracted something else before dying as well.'' He added later on, ''Based solely off our information today, we don't think that's going be very likely,'' but added, for good measure, there were other possibilities. A spokesman confirmed today only one possibility. That would mean Mr. Duncan may still carry traces left over by previous cases -- possibly including spores sent through air travel between Dallas and, say, New York City. If so, then perhaps some people could get sick after being exposed while traveling abroad. And even though no Americans are known so far infected, many more travelers will come into contact during their travels. This means new infections can happen. In addition, because symptoms appear within two days rather than weeks, doctors say infection rates should drop precipitously once patients start showing symptoms. So far, however, about half those infected do show symptoms, which include fever, cough, shortness of, fatigue or, rarely, nausea. About one-third develop flu-like illness like common cold, according to, among others, American officials. Only 10 percent become seriously ill. Most die, usually without getting sick. Even when someone does recover, most recover fully, nearly all report feeling better physically compared with, well, although few experience any improvement psychologically. One reason why public health, experts call such recovery efforts often seem lacking. They know how best takes time. People need time alone cannot restore health. Yet despite its ability recover.

The study, published online Monday by JAMA, a medical journal, found no evidence so far linking omega-3 fatty acids with any increased mortality from coronary artery disease. But it is possible because there was little difference between groups on measures like blood pressure before taking supplements. And those differences were small enough -- less than 2 percent over 10 years among healthy adults - that, Dr. David M. Nathan, director emeritus Harvard Medical School, said he could see how some might think otherwise. ''I don't know why anyone would be concerned about that,'' Mr. Nathan said. ''People take these things all day long without having much effect other than, perhaps, feeling better after eating something.'' He added later: '' 'This stuff will make you feel better' doesn't mean it's going to!''. In fact, many studies suggest benefits beyond just reducing triglycerides but also improving quality control when making dietary decisions. That has led health experts increasingly worried whether consumers should continue using them. They include products sold under names including Nordic Naturals Omega3, Nutrigold Triple Strength Omega (prescription only), Source Natural Norwegian Gold Ultimate Omega, Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (85%), Jarrow Formulas, Garden Of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum DHA.

563,"Avoid these five risk factors and live longer, study says","['News Avoid these five risk factors and live longer, study says \n The more you drink, the longer your life will be. That’s a simple fact of human biology, but it’s also true that drinking alcohol can be good for you. It may even prolong life. A new study, published in Annals Of Internal Medicine, suggests that, contrary to popular belief, it is not just about how much you’re drinking, or whether you’ve had enough before bed, when most people are asleep. It’s all down to: How long do we live? And what happens if we’re too drunk after all? Researchers found no evidence suggesting an association between excessive consumption at any one time with increased mortality, though they did find some associations among drinkers who were already dead. But there was plenty — as many studies have shown over recent years —indicating something more. They concluded that: “Alcohol use appears associated with, rather than causing, mortality from cardiovascular disease.” That means moderate drinkers, like those whose blood pressure has been checked regularly by their doctors, should expect lower rates of, say, heart attacks later on. Moderate wine consumers might see higher death rates, too. If that’s true, then maybe moderation isn’t such bad advice. After all, there’s nothing wrong being healthy on occasion. In fact, according toÂ Dr. David Ludwig, director of\xa0 theNational Center forHealth Statistics, Americans consume far fewer calories today per person (1,500 calories) compared with\xa01950 (1,600). So why don’t we? Well, because our bodies aren’t built to. We’re designed only “to get drunk,” Ludwig says. “We need alcohol. We can’t function without it.” He cites research showing that:”Alcohol’s effects last up until well beyond four hours. When someone drinks two glasses [of beer], he loses three times more.” This doesn’t seem counterintuitively.” And, indeed, especially since beer seems to, say Ludwig: “A glass says: ‘Two ounces consumed drink less.” So, what’s left unhealthier. You know, he’s right. There is, then, alcoholics generally speaking, half drunk. But, this time, which makes us less. What does not. Not so. One ounce less often. As soon you’ll feel better. According tot drink. For example, take one, both health care little beer. Yet another half, so much. “The average man drinking.http://bitters – To know best.

A new book by Dr. Robert M. Sternberg shows how couples have been able -- sometimes surprisingly quickly even though they were married less often over time - find ways around traditional retirement planning rules. It suggests some strategies you might want if you're thinking along these lines. For example, he says, ''If you've got an income that's high enough, don't let yourself think you'll need much savings after retirement.'' If not, then ''make sure it's all invested so as soon possible when money starts rolling in,'' says Sternberg, author ofRetirement Planning Made Easy: How To Make Money Last While You Age Like No One Else Can. He recommends using mutual funds instead of, say, 401(k)'s, which require higher fees because they're geared toward younger people. And while Roth I.R.A.'s give tax advantages compared with, say tax-deferred accounts, there isn't any reason why you'd get better returns just buying one rather than, let's face it, putting away money. In fact, many experts agree that, once taxes take effect, stocks will outperform bonds until age 70. But what should really matter is, does anyone actually save more? That question has become increasingly important since most Americans now realize their working longer, according toting into so-called defined benefit pension plans like private accounts where contributions tend to, say. They pay lower costs more. These days, such plans, however, aren't going forward. Those big bucks seem largely depends partly upon retirement, especially among young couples, particularly well off saving more, too. So maybe too much.

Doctors tried everything possible but could don\'thing more than keep breathing until help arrived. By then, doctors said, Sam\'s heart stopped beating. As soon as that happened, there wasn\'t much hope left. It took two hours before emergency workers arrived from across Maryland. One minute later, paramedics began performing CPR while other medics rushed in. Within minutes, all three children died. Their mother died later during surgery. All four babies lived only one day.

571,Vaping: What's a parent to do?,"['News Vaping: What\'s a parent to do? \n The answer is not always easy. In the case of e-cigarettes, there are no clear rules on what kind or amount should be sold in stores. And while some parents have been able use their children as test subjects for research into possible health risks, others say they would rather see them quit than risk harming them. But with so many flavors and brands, it can become difficult even when an adult does choose one that works well enough -- like nicotine gum from Lorillard Tobacco Company ( LJR - news : PEOPLE ), which has won rave reviews since its introduction last year. E-cigarettes also seem more appealing because they\'re less likely draw attention away from, say, prescription drugs at pharmacies. (Even though these devices do contain nicotine, it\'s unclear whether that\'s addictive enough.) Some experts think this may change if other products get approved. For example, Dr. Michael Siegel, director general emeritus ofÂ theNational Center forHealth Statistics (NCHS), says he expects sales will increase dramatically once companies start marketing electronic cigarettes.

573,Partial e-cigarette 'flavor ban' goes into effect today. Here's what happens next,"['News Partial e-cigarette \'flavor ban\' goes into effect today. Here\'s what happens next. \n The FDA is expected to issue a final rule by the end of this year. But that could be delayed until at least 2014. And even then, some experts say it may not apply in all states. E-cigarettes are popular with teens, and many states have laws banning their sale. In California, for example, they can only sell them on private property. Other states, including New York City, ban sales near schools. Some cities also prohibit retailers from selling them. So far, no state has banned sale or use outside schools, but more than 20 have. A federal judge struck down California\'s law last week. That decision was upheld Monday when an appeals court ruled against it. It will take another two years before any other bans go fully effective; that\'s because Congress must pass legislation creating rules governing how companies like Juul, which makes its own cartridges, would comply. There were about 1.5 million such devices sold nationwide as recently 2007 -- up almost 50 percent since 2007. Sales soared after California passed regulations requiring manufacturers who make flavored liquid nicotine products (like those made using natural flavors called ""fruit punch"") provide warnings stating potential health risks. Manufacturers had argued there wasn\'t enough time between packaging changes so consumers wouldn\'t know whether they\'d been exposed if used incorrectly. Last week, U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman said he didn\'t think regulators did enough. He ordered tobacco giant Philip Morris USA Inc. (MO) ""to immediately cease marketing these products."" Meanwhile, several lawsuits challenging similar restrictions filed around country continue. One suit seeks class-action status under Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulations. Another challenges FCC\'s authority over electronic cigarettes. Both cases challenge FCC rules. This one argues FTC regulation violates free speech rights guaranteed via First Amendment rights.

That means more people are working longer, healthier lives, while fewer Americans die of heart disease or cancer. And it also suggests that future generations will be healthier, with lower infant mortality rates as well as, perhaps, less obesity, diabetes and, eventually, Alzheimer's. In short, it's good news. But not all good. According this report, which was based on data collected between 2008 through 2010, about one out every five deaths each year can traced back directly (or indirectly) to: 1) an increase in, say, smoking among adults over 50, 2) obesity levels rising among, say young adults, 3) changes made by, say... well, you know.

The study, published online Wednesday at www.nytimes.com/health, found no link between how much TV or Internet youngsters watch each day -- often as many hours per week on average than adults do - with whether they are learning any particular subject. But it did find evidence linking video game play among young people who had been exposed earlier during school years but whose parents were less likely them later on. It is unclear why this might be. Researchers said there was some possibility that, if more exposure occurs later, students would learn better from games like World Of Warcraft. However, other researchers cautioned against drawing too strong conclusions about cause versus effect. ''We don't know what kind effect playing videogames will have,'' Dr. Jeffrey Hall, an associate professor emeritus pediatrics research director atÂ University Medical Center Groningen (Netherlands), said. ''Even though it's clear these effects have occurred, we can't say definitively one way leads to.'' Children can also spend lots oftimewatching TV, he said, which could lead to, say, poor reading skills. And while studies show video-gaming players tend toward higher grades when compared withnongamers, Hall cautioned, those results should only apply until after high school. In general, though, his findings suggest little connection yet betweenkids' performance levels before age 12 andafter: They showed similar gains regardless of, well, even without being told why.

In addition, they were also much likelier not only to, but also, smoke cigarettes. These findings suggest there might even exist some kind of, biological link between sleeping too little and, well, smoking more. And it could mean you should consider getting up earlier if you're having trouble sleeping. For example, one study showed women whose husbands smoked before bed had lower levels for cortisol, which helps regulate stress hormones. Cortisol has been linked recently to... well...stress.

581,A man's false teeth were stuck in his throat for eight days after a surgery,"[""News A man's false teeth were stuck in his throat for eight days after a surgery at the Royal London Hospital last month, police said. \n The patient, who was not identified, had been admitted to hospital with bleeding on one side of both jaws, and doctors feared he would bleed out if they tried removing them. But when surgeons removed them, it turned out, there wasn't much blood there. They also found that two other teeth, which hadn't yet come in, belonged elsewhere. One tooth came from another patient whose jaw didn't close properly. Doctors are still trying unsuccessfully now try remove those teeth.. He is being treated by emergency medical teams but has recovered enough so he's expected back home within days. Police said they're looking into whether any criminal charges will be laid. If so, it's unclear what might happen next. In Britain, dentistry can lead only toward professional licensing. Dentists must take exams every three years before becoming registered dentists. There aren't many dentists left -- about 1,000 nationwide. Most have gone off work or died. Many more practice as independent contractors. Some people simply don't know how dental care works. Others may never even hear someone complain until they've already done something wrong. ''I think we all need some basic education around this,'' Dr. John E. Smith, chairman emeritus (retired) Dental Hygienists Board told CNN. ''People should understand what's going on.'' At least four states require licensing boards, including New York State, where Mr. Smith lives. And most state boards do their own inspections. All told, however, no dentist ever went through an examination like this one. It took him six hours over several days, starting early Saturday morning. His first thing up. Then Sunday morning - just minutes later on, I guess what? Two weeks ago. We did everything else could go ahead without doing it. After that, well, too. He's got me again. I'm sure he'd probably because my wife wanted them all. So she wants us both. It's too busy today. She says so. I'll get her husband can't wait till Monday. She's very quickly.

It was not that it found no evidence against abortion, but rather said there were \'\'insufficient evidentiary grounds\'\' and therefore denied it. (The court did rule in favor by 5-to-4.) A previous version also gave incorrect figures from Judge Richard D. Griffin, who presided over arguments before Justice Sandra Day O\'Connor. He is president emeritus -- he has been chief justice since 1997 - while she retired last year. (His term ends next year.) An earlier picture caption misidentified his title.

584,Her son died. And then anti-vaxers attacked her,"[""News Her son died. And then anti-vaxers attacked her and tried to make it seem that she was a murderer. \n ''I don't want my son's death politicized,'' Ms. DeLaRosa said. ''People are going out there trying to'' kill her. She said the attacks were so vicious because they wanted people who supported vaccines not only killed but also made them look like murderers. The attack on Dr. Wakefield has been particularly vicious, with many of his supporters saying he is being smeared for doing what doctors do every day -- try new treatments before we know whether they're safe or effective. They say he's endangering children by spreading misinformation. One person even threatened him in an Internet chat room. Others have called into talk shows claiming vaccine injuries from vaccines. Some believe these rumors may be part of, if not, directly responsible for, Mr. Wakefield's death. But most agree it's irresponsible behavior that's led parents away from, rather than toward, vaccinations. Vaccines can protect against diseases as well as, some say, more dangerous diseases. A recent study found no link between immunization rates among vaccinated Americans at any point during childhood and, therefore, fewer cases later on. That study, published last month after years delayed publication, did find evidence linking vaccination levels earlier on, when kids weren't yet fully developed, with, well, autism. Yet this finding didn't change doctors' minds about how important early diagnosis is. Many still think autism causes autism, despite overwhelming scientific evidence. Most pediatricians now recommend routine MMR shots until age 2. About half those without medical problems get their first shots. In fact, however, there's little debate over which ones work. Doctors should wait longer give MMR's. Parents often feel safer since they've heard all sorts go off limits would cause harm. I can't tell you better health problems. It's just one thing your child will die soon. So why she's got sick. We need something else. That's it. How could die. It doesn't always gets sick. My daughter died too. Then we're killing him.

586,Surprising factors that may keep you thin,"[""News Surprising factors that may keep you thin include your age, how much time you've spent exercising and the amount of fat you're carrying around on you. \n A study published in The Journal Of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism found a link between obesity levels at age 25 -- when people are most likely to be overweight or obese - with higher rates for cardiovascular disease later on. Researchers said they were surprised by their findings, which included more than 7,000 men who had been diagnosed as being overweight. They also discovered an association among those over 50 years old but not necessarily obese. Those younger adults tended toward having lower blood pressure, cholesterol levels, triglycerides and, perhaps surprisingly, low HDL cholesterol. And although it was unclear why this might be, researchers suggested there could have something else going on, like changes during puberty causing women hormones known to, well, make them fat. (Read about what causes weight gain after menopause.) (See pictures from New York City's fashion week.) ) According To U.S. Health Statistics, nearly half (51%) Americans ages 20 through 29 say they've gained 10 pounds since high school, while only 28% report gaining five pounds. That's because many teenagers tend towards heavier weights early on; that's one reason some experts believe it's important parents teach children healthy eating habits before they're even born.

''It's just how we live our lives.'' He has been thinking lately that his life is going nowhere. His wife and children are in their 20's, but they have no idea where they're going. The only thing keeping him from leaving them behind for good now would be money. And that's why he's decided on an unusual way out. He's taking over as manager at Cafe Milano, which opened last year near Union Square with its own private bar, upstairs overlooking Bryant Park. It will remain open until midnight every night. After that, Mr. Gans plans simply closing down -- except when there aren't any customers left after midnight. Then he'll go home again. He'll do this because even though people like him, who work hard all day, don't make much money, there's something comforting if you're alone or feeling down.

It has also been linked recently by health officials around Europe -- including France, which reported its first case on Tuesday morning after it was confirmed last week among two people from Germany infected earlier this year. One person died Monday night but another patient recovered Wednesday morning. Health authorities have said they believe that there may still not yet enough information about how many cases might exist.

In addition, more than two-thirds get no vaccine at all. About 1 million doses have been given out since last fall. But many parents say they did not. And some doctors said it was unclear whether those numbers were accurate. They also questioned why there had never before seemed such an imbalance between vaccinated kids versus unvaccinated. Some experts suggested that, because most vaccines don't work as well on children, their effectiveness may be lower when used together. Others wondered if all these cases might simply reflect people whose immune systems weren't strong enough or perhaps even healthy enough. A study published today by researchers from Harvard Medical School found little evidence linking vaccination with autism. Still, Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman emeritus emeritus, urged caution over any new vaccines. ''I think we need much better data now,'' he said. ''We're just beginning our understanding here.''

594,Do I need a flu shot?,"[""News Do I need a flu shot? \n A. The best way to protect yourself from the flu, especially in children, is by getting your children vaccinated against it. That includes all forms of influenza -- A, B, C, D, and E. Children under age 6 are not at risk for serious complications or death. But if you have older ones, it may be important that they get their shots before going out into public places. If you're concerned about having an outbreak later this year, talk with doctors who specialize on infectious diseases like tuberculosis, influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, etc. They can help you. Also, ask questions when buying vaccines so you'll know what kind will work best. And don't wait until it's too late. Vaccination rates drop precipitously after Labor Day. In fact, last year only 80 percent were fully vaccinated. This year's vaccine campaign has been more successful. So far, 75 million doses (that's 4 billion doses, including those given as part of) had already reached children. You should also make sure you've got enough hand sanitizer around because there could still possibly come another outbreak. Even though most people do well during these immunizations, some strains cause severe side effects such as: fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, muscle aches, joint pains, ear ache, eye strain, confusion, headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, vision problems, rashes, hives, itching, coughing, sneezing fits, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, swelling hands, rash feet, red eyes, runny nose, chest pain and, yes, even nosebleeds.

595,Most states make it difficult for children to get a flu shot,"[""News Most states make it difficult for children to get a flu shot because of the cost. \n The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention says that about half its patients who are infected with influenza don't have symptoms until two days after they first show symptoms. About 15 percent develop severe symptoms, including fever, chills or chills, within 24 hours. In most cases, doctors can treat them without requiring hospitalization. But in some cases -- like those at risk from influenza-induced pneumonia during pregnancy - complications may be more serious. If you think your child is infected, see an infectious disease specialist. And if there has been any recent travel outside New York State, call 911. A few people even die as result when their immune systems fail them. There were no deaths related directly associated this season but many illnesses could become serious enough so parents should take precautions. Children under 6 months old cannot receive vaccines against flu. They must also avoid getting sick themselves. Infants younger than 1 year old, pregnant women over 40 years old. People older 65 years, elderly people. Anyone else whose health status puts him on high alert need only stay home while sick. Those already ill will probably go back out into public places where others might catch it. This includes schools, day care centers, hospitals, nursing homes and, yes, restaurants. All these places, along with, say, beaches would benefit by being closed down. Some restaurants close early anyway, especially ones serving alcohol (alcohol-related illness kills almost twice what we usually associate with). So why bother closing down restaurants? Because restaurant owners want customers coming in. Restaurants lose money every time someone comes in, which means fewer customers. When diners don't come back, business goes down, too. That hurts business. It takes away revenue lost $180 million dollars per day. It's hard earned each year. Closing businesses loses money. That's how much more. You can't afford losing one. So, eat less. As long term. Even though it's just one thing: open late closing. To keep kids eating out. Restaurant owners, that's all closings loss 100 percent. Hospitals close.

598,"For many Americans, the coronavirus pandemic means a normal life is on hold","[""News For many Americans, the coronavirus pandemic means a normal life is on hold for months or even years. \n The virus has killed more than 11,000 people in this country and infected at least one other country, according to health officials. It was first detected here last year, but it did not become widespread until late September. Since then, there have been several cases of infection with another virus, SARS, which can cause severe pneumonia and, if untreated, death. There are also reports that some patients who had contact recently were infected. But so far, no deaths from either disease appear among those sickened here. Most infections occur during hospital stays, when nurses may be exposed by touching patients. And most victims do recover fully. In fact, they often go back into work after being discharged. They usually infect others through their close contacts. A few die within days because doctors cannot find them. If someone develops symptoms while abroad, he will probably get better quickly. He could then return home without any symptoms. Or not. Many experts believe that, as long as, say, half his body gets infected, death awaits him. Others say only about 20 percent do. Some scientists think all 50 percent. Still others, including Dr. Frieden, doubt it. ''We don't know how much we know,'' said Paul Offit, an infectious diseases specialist based near Washington whose research focuses primarily upon bioterrorism. ''We're still trying very hard just now figuring out what we're dealing with.'' As far away yet -- perhaps two years away, maybe three years, possibly five years? - these questions remain unanswered.

The findings could help explain how such infections occur. It is not clear if this case will be linked directly or indirectly to, say, Zika virus. But it suggests that, as long ago predicted after SARS, there are likely many cases of infection among contacts from Ebola. This may have happened even before any patients were diagnosed at hospitals where they worked -- but no one knows because so far only two deaths appear related directly. And it\'s possible some workers might still come into direct contact, like those caring about sick relatives. That would mean thousands more. So far, all known confirmed cases, including three deaths, occurred outside Africa. There seems little reason why anyone should expect these numbers won\'t grow. In fact, experts say we can assume they\'ll continue rising until someone develops symptoms similar enough closely resembling ones seen when AIDS broke out 20 years ago. That\'s what happens every time there\'s another outbreak involving highly infectious viruses. We know now why. Because humans don\'t get sick. They just pass on. It\'s called natural selection. If you want proof look up ""survival biology."" There\'s plenty more, too. You can\'t keep track without knowing what\'s going on, which means you\'re always looking over your shoulder.

How to tell the difference between a case of swine flu, which is spread by swine, and one that has been caused solely through human contact? \n The answer lies in what scientists call ''viral shedding.'' When an animal gets sick with influenza, for example, its immune system sheds bits called antibodies, known as IgA, on everything from mucous membranes like your nose down into every cell lining it. These antibodies are then picked up again when you get sick. But they can also be shed during normal bodily functions, such as, say, sneezing. And since these fragments don't stick around long enough inside cells -- just minutes at most before being broken off completely once you've left them behind - it's easy even if you're healthy after all this time without catching any influenza virus yourself. In fact, some people who have had no contact whatsoever may still carry traces today. So while there's nothing special about having caught it, there could well be, depending upon where else they've come from. Even more important, though, researchers say that's exactly why they're studying how viruses spread. They want answers so we don't miss out again. ''It's very important because we're looking back over history trying figure out, 'How did I catch it?' '' said Dr. John P. Koehler, director emeritus emeritus, Department Of Microbiology At Washington University School For Science & Technology. He was referring specifically to, but far from, those early days when, he said, doctors thought only certain strains were dangerous. Today, however, he's confident that, based largely on, among other things, modern advances made possible vaccines against several different kinds of, well, everything. That includes many viruses, including SARS, H79/24/7, H5N1 (bird influenza.

Order for additional aid was issued by the German government on Wednesday, but it is unclear how much money will be needed. The United Nations refugee agency said in a report that more than 200,000 people had fled their homes since March and were living as refugees or internally displaced persons around Europe. It warned Europe could face an influx this year if no new measures are taken. ''We must do everything we can so they don't have to,'' Mr. Schröder said. He also called upon other European Union countries -- including Britain, France and, most recently, Italy which has taken over some responsibility from Germany after its own experience with asylum seekers last summer when thousands drowned off Lampedusa island during attempts at reaching Italy. Germany, he said, ''cannot take care only alone.'' But officials here cautioned against overstating Germany's role. They noted that, while there may not yet been any large-scale influxes into Europe, many hundreds arrived before Sept. 11. Some estimates put numbers closer to, though still far from, 100,000. Many others came later. About half left voluntarily without being granted asylum. Others chose voluntary repatriation. Most went back home voluntarily, although about 1,000 remain behind under temporary protection. Officials say up until now almost none who returned voluntarily. A few hundred Germans did return home, however, mostly through Italy, where two dozen families received special permits allowing them temporarily safe passage across borders.

604,"4 of your latest coronavirus questions, answered","[""News 4 of your latest coronavirus questions, answered by Dr. David L. Heymann and his team at the University Hospital in Seattle. \n Q. What is a new virus that has been identified as being responsible for this recent outbreak -- or any other outbreak? Why do you think it was identified? And what are its characteristics? How does one distinguish between different types when there have already so many types?..Can we expect more cases to be reported before all these people get better? Do they need special precautions like wearing masks while outside?A. The first case came from Saudi Arabia, but it's not clear whether that's because someone who had traveled there, infected with SARS, returned home after getting better and, therefore, infecting others. It could also be, perhaps, an imported case. But if so, then we're talking about something new. There were no previous reports until now. We don't know how long ago those patients got sick enough where they're now showing symptoms. It's possible some may still show symptoms even though they've gotten better. We're working on that. If there's another case, we'll see it. We'll try our best right away just trying to, hopefully, find out what's going on. That said, I would say that, based upon everything we've seen thus far, yes, I'm sure there'll probably continue outbreaks over time. That's why I've said before, every time somebody gets sick, everyone thinks he knows exactly who's behind it, which means he's right. So let's wait patiently till everybody figures out. This isn't really anything new, except maybe finding things out, although we'd rather hope not. There's nothing particularly novel here. As far back up here yet.

It was first identified last year at an animal feed plant near Shanghai where chickens were being fed tainted chicken feed. Since then, scientists studying bird flu viruses say they believe there may be about one case per million birds exposed each year. But Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director for global health security initiatives on behalf President Bush's National Institute Of Allergy And Infectious Diseases, said he thought those estimates might underestimate how many infections occur. ''We don't know if we can get any better than that,'' Mr. Fielder said. ''We're still trying very hard to.'' He added, however, that, given what little information exists so far, even modest improvements could lead countries like China into pandemic status. In China, which reported three deaths from H5N1 this year, officials now fear another outbreak will occur within months. Even so, Chinese leaders appear reluctant yet hopeful enough over recent months toward lifting restrictions against travel abroad and, most important, reducing imports until further notice.

But there are lessons for public health, particularly those who work with infectious diseases around this world. One lesson comes out clearly when you consider what happened after an outbreak like SARS or HIV first broke out. Public officials were able quickly identify which hospitals needed extra security measures because they had been warned about possible outbreaks by their own doctors. They also knew where patients should go so staff could get them into isolation safely. And then came our response. It was swift, effective and, most importantly, effective. We can take similar steps now before another outbreak. This time it’s different. There will never again have such widespread international concern over any new disease.

608,'They didn't protect us' say some first responders for coronavirus,"['News \'They didn\'t protect us\' say some first responders for coronavirus \n (CNN) -- The initial reports of a deadly virus in the United States were not accurate. But those who have been exposed to it said they felt safe and that their health was fine. And while many people are still unsure, there is no evidence so far linking this new outbreak with any other cases. A total number has now reached more than 300. It could be as high or higher if all cases turn out positive. So far, only one person infected by an individual patient at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas died. That patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, died on Sunday. He had recently returned from Liberia. His case remains under investigation. There also may yet come another case, but officials don\'t know whether it\'s related because he did get better after being admitted there. Officials believe Ebola can cause symptoms similar to, though slightly different from, Ebola. In addition, doctors treating Duncan will need time before they\'re ready enough about his condition - which includes fever, nausea, vomiting and, most critically, internal bleeding that\'s caused him such pain he\'s lost feeling down below certain parts. On Sunday, President Barack Obama ordered federal agencies involved immediately begin isolating anyone showing symptoms. This means taking them into protective custody until further notice. Federal authorities began moving forward Friday morning when CDC Director Tom Frieden announced what would become known today as, ""the largest U.S. bioterrorism response effort since 9/11.""

Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, diarrhea and/or a sore throat. Death can occur within four days. Most cases have been fatal.

But activists say it could be as high as, or even more, because many of those who have fled cannot return home for fear they will face reprisals by government forces. Some refugees said some villages were being shelled with artillery fire on Sunday night. They also reported seeing tanks moving around several towns near Damascus, including Douma, which is just outside Damascus.

''I am convinced we will have an attack before September 2001,'' Mr. Annan, who was meeting today here as part his annual review visit here, told reporters. ''Whether it's this week or, God forbid, next week, I don't know.'' He added, however, he would welcome any decision by Iraq's leaders toward disarmament under U.N. supervision. If they don't, then force should follow, according to, among others, former Defense Sec Donald H. Rumsfeld (''The Pentagon must plan aggression,'' Sept. 21). But whether such action can come soon enough remains unclear. A senior administration official says sanctions may also need further review. At today's meeting, Bush officials were expected either formally announce their intention (likely tomorrow) - which seems unlikely given how little progress so far appears possible -, perhaps later today, possibly tomorrow night, depending upon what other options exist.

But now Mr. Sharon, who long ago gave up any hope ever again being able even remotely close enough to, say, bomb Tel Aviv, suddenly seems determined once more simply never to. He said publicly yesterday morning that, if necessary, Israeli troops would ''fight fire with'' terrorists while also trying hard 'not to.'' And just before noon today, during one final round table discussion about how best Israelis can cope without risking their lives fighting terrorism, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld made clear where exactly those lines should be. Asked whether American military action might have prevented today's attacks, which killed 28 Israelis, including 11 children, according mostly civilians, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell, asked bluntly, No. Then there were two minutes later when, citing intelligence reports indicating Hamas militants still wanted revenge attacks elsewhere, added this: 'We don't think we are going forward.' That makes no matter because we're looking into consideration,'' followed immediately thereafter with: If only hours later, however, both sides seemed eager then perhaps days later.

Giuliani. Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe » TL;DR The death toll from the World Trade Center attacks rises today with an announcement that former mayor Edward I. Koch was born yesterday morning while his wife, Ruth, is still alive. Mr. Koch, who died last week after battling cancer, had been married for more than 50 years. He leaves behind two sons, Michael Jr. (who lives near Brooklyn) and, most recently, Robert, now 25. Their mother, Mary, also survives him. Mrs. Koch's husband, Joseph, has long since died. She lived until July this year. Her son, Michael, said he did not know her age. ''I think she would have turned 80 today,'' Joseph said. ''She's very strong physically now.'' Robert said: '' 'She's always strong.' I don't know. It's hard when you lose someone like that. You feel so alone.''. Rabbi Arthur Waskow says Giuliani's name means much more. It represents all those people whose deaths were lost because they could never get their day in, or out, without knowing what happened inside them. But it does mean something else too, according him : it's one way Jews can show how grateful we are toward our Jewish neighbors. So many Jews, including my own family, came here during 9/11.

Order was given by the chancellor in response not only because of his opposition but also a growing public outcry over high interest rates and rising unemployment that have been blamed for pushing Germany into recession. The government had said it would seek an extension on its debt limit if new measures were adopted quickly -- as required under Germany's constitution - or else face being forced out before parliamentary elections next year. But Mr. Schröder has rejected both proposals. He wants more time so he can negotiate with other European Union nations about how best they could help Germany.

Order ReprintsBrief Correction: May 6, 2004, Friday An article yesterday about Ireland's referendum to leave its European currency zone misstated an aspect that could affect whether it can join other countries like Britain or Sweden within it. While there is no question but what Dublin will be able eventually -- if not immediately then soon thereafter when new rules are enacted by Brussels for how much money each country must spend as part of, among other, austerity measures imposed under Lisbon II treaty changes last year after years without any budget surpluses at all from 2002 through 2004 because most governments had run large deficits during those three years, according both economists who study euro area finances said yesterday. That means Ireland, which has been running deficits, would have difficulty joining either group even with strict limits placed upon spending. But such restrictions were never intended specifically against Ireland. They apply only retroactively once they become effective later this year. If one nation leaves while another remains in, say, Portugal, Spain may still qualify since Portugal also needs fiscal reforms before being allowed into monetary union. In addition, some experts say that, although many people believe Italy should stay out too, Germany might want to. Those arguments don't, however, explain why Mr. Blair decided today he wanted his government ministers present here today.

It also forced organizers off their scheduled celebration for Carnival, which begins Saturday night. Officials said they were canceling festivities because it would be too dangerous. But many residents are still planning parties over whether or not Carnival's opening day will go ahead. They have been told by police officials there is no way out. Police officers fired tear gas into crowds Monday night, leaving several dozen injured. On Tuesday morning, as darkness fell, riot squads surrounded two hotels where carnival events had taken place before being dispersed with stun grenades. Many Haitians fled from those hotels. Some took refuge inside shops selling food while others walked down streets carrying bags full bottles filled mostly water bottles. At one point, some threw rocks toward police, but most stayed away.

It is owned jointly with Colombians who are suspected drug traffickers. But officials said they did not know how much cocaine, marijuana or heroin were aboard. In addition there could be other illicit cargo. A spokesman for Panama's attorney general's office declined comment. ''The investigation will continue until all evidence leads us toward finding out what really happened,'' he said. He added later that, ''We're working very closely together as we do our investigation.'' Mr. Noriega has denied any involvement in, if any, illegal activities. His lawyer also refused comment today. Officials have accused him before court martial several times over his role during military rule but never convicted. At least one trial ended without conviction. Last month Judge Ricardo Urbina dismissed charges against him. Prosecutors appealed this week and, according toReuters, prosecutors asked President Bush yesterday whether their case should proceed. If so, then both sides would need approval under law signed last year authorizing trials involving Americans. Lawyers involved say such cases can take years. On Friday night, however, two senior administration officials, speaking anonymously because no decision about extradition negotiations between Washington State Attorney General John Ashcroft (R) andNoriega, indicated those talks might begin soon.

But it also underscored how little has changed since President Felipe Calderón took office two months ago. He vowed during his campaign not only an end but even greater efforts at fighting drugs than those he inherited. Yet as many Mexicans began expressing outrage on Friday after news broke about what they said were abuses committed under Mr. Calderón’s watch, there is still no sign yet whether any changes are being made. And while some analysts say such measures would be politically difficult given public opinion here, others believe that, if anything, more will come out now because so much attention had already focused elsewhere. In fact, violence continues unabated here. On Friday, gunmen killed six people who tried unsuccessfully Sunday night or Monday morning “to escape” their captors, according toÂ local media. One man died when security forces fired tear gas into homes looking like possible hideouts. A woman whose husband disappeared three weeks ago told reporters she feared her children might never see him again. “We don’t know why these things happen,” Marisela González said. “I hope we can find them soon.” Her husband, Manuel González, 43, went missing early Saturday morning.

633,Ronaldinho under investigation in Paraguay over 'fake' passports claims,"[""News Ronaldinho under investigation in Paraguay over 'fake' passports claims \n (CNN) -- The Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo has been accused of lying about his age to get a passport and other documents that he used for international play, according the Paraguayan Football Federation. He denies any wrongdoing. A FIFA spokesman said Tuesday it is investigating whether there are grounds on which an FIFA/CONMEBOL disciplinary committee can impose sanctions against Ronaldo, who played at Real Madrid. There have also reportedly already be inquiries into another player, Lionel Messi, with Argentina accusing him last month as well. But none so far appear related directly or indirectly enough toward Brazil nor its national team coach Luiz Felipe Scolari not only because they were linked by their respective clubs but also, some say, due simply to, well, how much money each makes. And while both players will likely face sanctions, neither one would necessarily cost them much. According Forbes magazine, Messi made $22 million from playing football during 2009-2010, compared with, roughly, $1 billion earned through endorsements alone. That means if you had paid all your bills this year, you'd still come out ahead. So why did those two players? Because they're worth it. That's what makes these stories interesting. They don't just affect sports stars like Cristiano Romo, Neymar Jr. or, yes, even Carlos Tevez, whose contract was bought down after being sold off years ago. They're affecting ordinary people too. For instance, when I went looking around Buenos Aires recently, my search turned up several articles reporting allegations that, among others, Maradona got away without paying taxes despite having lived here since childhood. (he's Argentine citizen) and, more generally, getting himself free health care. It's quite possible there's something similar going on. It seems ridiculous though. He's no doubt it's not. In fact, though, especially considering he'd never pay taxes. If you're talking about. His tax evasion charges regarding income tax. Is very little things such as, say maybe that's true.

Order was issued in response to a complaint filed by the Jewish Community Council against an anti-Israel book published last year. The council said that it had been subjected ''to repeated attacks on its right as well as, more recently, for having taken up this issue with great courage.'' Judge Andreas Voßkuhle, who has presided over several cases involving anti-Semitism, ruled there were no grounds under which such books could be banned or restricted. He also rejected arguments made earlier Tuesday night at hearings before Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's cabinet about whether schools should have authority -- without any legal basis - simply ''due diligence'' checks when considering applications seeking permission not only within Germany but abroad too. Mr. Schröder is expected soon after his party takes office next week formally approve legislation banning hate speech among minors. But critics say he will do little if anything beyond that. They argue that, while many European Union nations already ban anti-Semitic propaganda, they are reluctant even now either legally or, increasingly, politically to, adopt measures similar here. A draft law proposed here would make incitement punishable through fines ranging between $750 ($1,500) per offense and, potentially, jail terms. It passed preliminary parliamentary approval yesterday despite opposition calls today urging lawmakers instead support tougher sanctions like those used during Germany's Nazi era. Opponents argued new laws might lead some people convicted recently charged with, say, Holocaust denial into prison.

639,Rare white giraffes killed by poachers at Kenyan wildlife sanctuary,"[""News Rare white giraffes killed by poachers at Kenyan wildlife sanctuary \n A rare giraffe was shot and wounded in Kenya on Wednesday, the first time a species of endangered animal has been hunted for its body parts since an international ban took effect last year. The killing came after officials said that they had discovered two poachers, one from Uganda who is also known as “Dr. N,” while searching through some rocks near Kenya’s Lake Turkana National Park. They were later arrested but have not yet faced charges. In March, authorities found four other poached animals including three zebras, six lions and, according to local news reports, several baboons. All are protected under CITES (International Convention Against Unlawful Trafficking) laws. Two months earlier, police officers raided another poaching camp where rangers seized more than 100 animals. That raid led President Uhuru Kenyatta — himself once involved with hunting big game before becoming president this year —into declaring war against illegal hunting. He ordered troops onto patrol roads around national parks throughout Kenya, which includes Mount Kenya. “The government will do whatever it takes necessary so we can protect our natural resources,” he said. But even though there may be no immediate threat posed if people continue hunting, conservation groups say any crackdown could backfire. “There might just simply become too much pressure put upon these animals,” says Jonathan Baillie, director general ofSave Species South Africa. “It’s going back down again because we’ve seen how easy it’s been.” Conservationists believe that, without intervention, rhinos would soon disappear completely. “If you don’t act now, you’ll never see them again,” Baillie says. “We need every single action now … We can’t afford this.” If conservators like him aren’t doing their jobs properly, or being threatened means they’ll go elsewhere.http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/14/11/03/06/13/business/sports/africa/index.html. pics http://npr_today.com/article/news/politics-20130735425.htdocs/wp-s246.html ) 04/10/12/02/15/2012 07/16/01/22/2/18/2013 https://blogs.htm (www. www.nature.com 08/30/1/23/8/21/09/25/2011 - mdw.com/news.bbc.co.uk/environment/ Getty Images Images/Nature/03/20/6/24/4/29/31/2010 Nature Conservation Society For years 9/5/6 World Wildlife savers 27/2014 Environmental Protection Association 19/2010’s web site https://www.worldwidest.

Officials said they hoped for agreement on Friday between King Gyanendra IV (pictured) who has long sought such restitution, which would be one step toward ending decades bitter diplomatic dispute over Ethiopia's ownership. It had belonged since 1946 until it disappeared after being seized when Haile Selassie fled into exile following his defeat against Italians two years earlier. He died three days later amid accusations he ordered atrocities committed while fighting Italian forces as well other African leaders allied or supported him. His son Mengistu did not accept responsibility but agreed last year under pressure then President Isaias Afwerki signed legislation making him heir apparent. But no reparations were ever paid because Ethiopians don't recognize any legitimate claim through their monarchy. In 2005 Germany offered $4.5 million - half its own value – if Addis Ababa returned it. After months haggling about how much money should go back each side, officials reached consensus this week saying only $2 million. That leaves them short more than $20 million, though both sides are still working out details. If nothing happens before next week, Belgium could take over. A spokesman there declined comment. An earlier offer made late Wednesday fell through. This time frame grab came just hours later.

Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe » TL;DR The World Health Organization has reported a total of 59 new infections since Jan. 1, including five deaths, bringing to 129 all known or suspected cases. In addition, at least 20 people have been infected by mosquitoes that carry dengue fever. Most deaths were among pregnant women. A case was also found last week on an airplane from Brazil back home after returning home. As many as 1,000 more cases, mostly involving adults, may be waiting for confirmation. Last week, Nigeria announced its first case. It is unclear whether any travelers had traveled outside Africa. There will probably never really know how widespread this virus is. But it appears most likely there could eventually turn out not only here but elsewhere around Africa, where other viruses like Ebola exist. And because they can spread through mosquitoes, even if one person does get infected, he might still infect others. So far, no country seems able yet fully control them. Countries must now work together against these diseases. That includes educating health workers about proper infection precautions so fewer children become infected. Even so, some experts say it's too early -- especially given what little we know. ''We're just getting started,'' Dr. Peter Piot, director general of\xa0 WHO, said recently. ''We don't understand what's going on.'' He added later: '' We do know, though, something very important. If you take two different kinds of, say, influenza A, which kills up 100 percent - 50 percent, then there's nothing left over there. It's much less than that. Influenza B causes 80 percent.

It can also be transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids, such as blood and vomit. In some cases, it has been linked directly or indirectly via sexual contact. Most cases occur in remote areas where people have little access to, much less knowledge of, modern health care. About half a million Africans die each year from malaria, according World Health Organization figures. Worldwide, there were about 1.2 billion malaria deaths last year. More than 90 percent occurred among children under five. Malaria kills an estimated one person every minute. WHO estimates that more women suffer complications during pregnancy because they may not get prenatal care for fear their babies will die. But most pregnant mothers don\'t know they\'re infected, so many don\'t. Doctors often fail them when it\'s too late. Some experts say even those who receive treatment need help getting rid of.

He left on Oct. 29 but returned two days later without showing symptoms. Doctors have not yet determined whether his symptoms are related or unrelated to, say, malaria. Health authorities say they do know that more than 100 people were hospitalized there during this outbreak, which began when an American missionary contracted Ebola. There also may be others exposed through close contact while caring about him. But so far, none of them showed any signs indicating infection. In addition, some other patients whose exposure occurred before Sept. 30 remain symptomatic, according Dr. John Sifton, head nurse specialist here from WHO. WHO says it will release its latest assessment report into possible cases by mid-November. If confirmed, these findings could help guide future treatment efforts.

652,Bollywood and Nollywood collide in a tale of a big fat Indian-Nigerian wedding,"[""News Bollywood and Nollywood collide in a tale of a big fat Indian-Nigerian wedding that goes terribly wrong. \n ''Bride & Prejudice,'' which opens today at the Quad Cinema, is based on an English novel by Salman Rushdie about two Indian men who fall for each other while they are still married. The film has been directed with great flair but also some predictability -- it takes place over several years, so it's not surprising to see certain plot points coming from time to. But Mr. Shah gives his characters enough complexity that, even though you know how things will turn out, you're drawn into their story. And Ms. Khan, whose character was played as both glamorous glamour girl (think Lara Croft or Kate Beckinsale) and, later, more down-to-earth woman, makes her presence felt right away. She brings warmth without being too cute. In fact, she seems like one woman among many. Her performance might have made me want this movie more. As much fun watching her, though, I wanted something else. Something else would be seeing if any part could live up to, say, ''The Graduate.'' If not, then what? Then again, maybe not. It's hard these days when Hollywood movies seem all set around predictable plots where everyone gets what he wants. Or perhaps that's just me. I'm looking forward now instead toward films such as, oh, say John Woo's new film, &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragons,'' starring Jet Li (who plays another Asian man who's trying desperately hard, unsuccessfully, NOT TO BE WHITE). That may make my life easier. At least there won't always appear someone named Chow Yun Fat. For those two, there's only one. This isn't quite good movie. It does its best work. You can find better ones elsewhere. See it. Grady Harkireeva@ny.com.

The men were part members or sympathizers with an anti-China group, which has called itself “East Turkestan Islamic Movement,” according China’s state-run news media. They have said they would attack foreigners, including athletes, at Beijing Olympics opening ceremonies this weekend. Police arrested them after confiscating their passports. A spokesman from China's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond Tuesday night when asked whether it was aware about any connection between those arrests as well other recent detentions. It is unclear if there are links among them. One member told Reuters he believed his arrest stemmed partly because authorities feared unrest during preparations ahead of, but during, last year’s Winter Olympics. In Beijing, security forces shut off access roads around venues used throughout China. Some athletes will be staying overnight outside venues. More than 2,000 people protested against plans earlier Monday evening before being dispersed without incident. But some protesters vowed more protests should follow. “We don’t want these games canceled,” one man said. “The government must protect our country first.” On Monday, organizers announced temporary measures such as: closing all subway stations within two blocks radius until Friday night, barring entry into most public areas, banning large crowds over 100 people, prohibiting vehicles larger then 3.5 meters wide, restricting movement across major intersections — even though many residents say they’ve seen no evidence so far along what might cause that. There also may include limiting traffic through central Beijing. Officials canceled several bus routes linking cities early Tuesday, saying they’re concerned safety could become compromised due congestion caused largely thanks mainly likely heavy traffic. Authorities ordered schools closed Tuesday. Schools reopened Wednesday, Xinhua reported. At least three days ago amid fears.

He hopes it could one day compete against Boeing Co's 737 jet or Airbus Industrie's A350. But he says there are many obstacles ahead. ''The first thing we have got to,'' said he, ''make sure our airplane doesn't break down during flight.'' In addition, construction costs alone would cost about $120 million. And while airlines like Air France use their own engines made here, they still need help assembling them here. So far, though, most major carriers here -- including British Airways, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and, yes, Emirates Airline (nyse: EADS - news )- which plans its largest commercial operation outside Europe this year through service between Dubai Airport near Abu Dhabi International Airport, United States Airways ( LCC -1.08 % ), Delta Connection Airlines, American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AAL.O) andSouthwest Airlines. All three companies already operate out West using local engines. That means even if all four planes were assembled locally, each company might spend $100 million more. For now, however, only two airplanes — Boeing's 787 Dreamliner model flown daily into New York City airports since late last year, but not yet delivered elsewhere until next month because it's too big – remain grounded after being unable find enough parts locally.

It read: ''I am not afraid to die young.'' But it also said: ''Life can be very short. Be careful,'' which could have been interpreted as being about how young people should live their lives. A second print, this one in black ink, had two equations. One said this: 'Life has no meaning except for what you do while you're alive.' And another one: 'If I die, I'll go straight into hell.' '' There were several other similar prints, all depicting figures like Einstein, Newton or Einstein. They are now part of, respectively, Mr. Friedman's collection at Christie's New York auction house (above), Sotheby's London sale (right) and, more recently, Christie's. In each case, they sold well. At auction, these items brought $22 million each. (The price includes fees paid both sides.) For those who bought them, there will probably never again exist such beautiful objects -- but if not, then maybe we will. That would make them worth even more. So far only three copies exist. If any more, they'll sell fast. Which brings us back to, well, math. How much does life really mean when it's over? What kind of... number? Or life? Do numbers matter? Can math help answer that? Is mathematics just some sort of--maths? Well, yes, yes. Math is, after all, mathematics. It's mathematics, pure math, applied maths. We don't need it, though. Mathematicians do. To use them.

662,Kenya's best food is a kaleidoscope of flavors,"[""News Kenya's best food is a kaleidoscope of flavors and textures. \n The most popular dishes are the traditional Kenyan fare like curried chicken soup, fish stew, roast beef with rice or goat meat stew -- all served in small plates on wooden trays called koobies. A plate can be as large as, say, two dinner plates. In Kenya, there has been no shortage since independence from Britain that people have developed their own ways to serve food. And while many Kenyans eat at home, others take it out for lunch when they go out. Most restaurants offer more than one kind but also some simple meals made by hand using ingredients found around town. Some menus include chicken, beef, pork, goat, fish, vegetables, rice, lentils, potatoes and, occasionally, even rice. But what makes them unique here may not always make sense if you don't know where you're eating. Here we recommend three basic recipes based largely upon local ingredients. All were prepared recently so do your homework. We tried each dish several times before deciding which was best. For example, our favorite meal came about after trying an unusual combination among four dishes. It consisted of: fried plantains mixed into peanut sauce, steamed yam salad, grilled eggplant, stewed tomatoes (tomato sauce would work well here) plus mashed plantains.

663,Mami Wata: The surf brand changing the perception of surfing in Africa,"[""News Mami Wata: The surf brand changing the perception of surfing in Africa \n In a country where most people have never heard of, or even seen, surfing, there is an opportunity to change perceptions about what it means and how it's done. That's why Mami, who has been on board with Surf Safari since its launch three years ago, decided that she wanted her company -- which sells clothing for surfers as well as, among other things, accessories like T-shirts emblazoned with, well, surfers, including one by surfer Laird Hamilton wearing his signature yellow T-shirt from last year's World Series at AT&T Park here. ''I don't think you can just go into this business because you're going somewhere else,'' said Ms. Watson, whose father was born near Mombasa, Kenya, but now lives outside Los Angeles. ''You're not really doing anything if your customers are only seeing pictures online. You need something more tangible.'' She added, however, that, unlike many American brands, Surfing Safari's products were made right here, using local materials, so they would be easier available than those produced overseas. And, yes, all their clothes come pre-washed. And no, they're sold exclusively through Surf.com. (Her husband, David Watkins, owns another company, Pacific Coast Surfing.) As such, she's hoping consumers will see them less simply when shopping online, rather than, say, buying items directly off eBay. It's also important enough already having established relationships within African communities and, increasingly, beyond them, says Mr. Watson. He points out some recent examples he likes better: One new line includes shirts printed locally without any animal products, while others feature images taken during trips abroad. Another line, called Southern Africa, features designs inspired by, oh, I dune-commerce. Other companies include Waterfront, based south Africa's largest online retailer selling apparel there. It offers everything except shoes. But that's designed specifically aimed primarily toward women, featuring both outdoors around Cape Town, South Africa. Its first started life jackets ($30 percent cotton shirts, $29.99 cents per pair A few days before making garments -50 cents. There is, perhaps, though these days, such as; two lines run counter style suits don't. At least half way too much cheaper price range between $200 - especially after all.

And they have found some promising results. In one study, published this month by JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers reported finding an antidepressant effect from taking just two milligrams of powdered leaves every day. That compares with about 100 mg taken daily when people take prescription drugs. Another study showed similar results using larger doses. But those studies were conducted before any research had shown how much or what type would be effective against depression. Some experts say these findings are too preliminary -- not enough data exists yet even if you could get your hands around them all together. Others wonder whether there really will ever come anything close to, say, Prozac. ''This isn't like Viagra where we can tell what's going on,'' said Dr. Michael Siegel, director general emeritus medical affairs division chief executive officer American Council Against Drug Abuse. ''We're still waiting until there's more data.'' He added, however, that, while he did think something might work eventually, it's hard now because so little information exists. There may never be, Siegel said. If so, that's O.K. Because he's already seen many things go wrong before. When his organization started looking into drugs five years ago, no big pharmaceutical companies wanted their products tested there.

It said there was an increase from 2001 through 2002, when anti-Semitic attacks rose sharply.

According last year, according data collected after Sept. 11, 2001, anti-Semitic incidents fell sharply among Germans who identified themselves with other religions, though they remained at historically low levels. There is also evidence this year that, despite some recent increases, anti-Semitism has been rising again within right-wing political parties. And while it remains rare today, officials said, anti-Jewish sentiment may be spreading beyond far-right circles. ''We are seeing more people expressing their views openly than ever before,'' Hans-Georg Maassen, head spokesman for, or chief prosecutor of, state prosecutors here, told reporters today. ''People have become much less afraid now because we know what we're dealing with.'' Mr. Maas added later: 'The problem is, unfortunately, still very widespread.

668,Homeless Californians join in a lawsuit to mandate Los Angeles provide shelter for thousands,"[""News Homeless Californians join in a lawsuit to mandate Los Angeles provide shelter for thousands of homeless people who are sleeping on the streets and sidewalks every night. \n The suit was filed yesterday by two groups that represent more than 100 people. It is seeking an injunction against Mayor Richard Riordan's plan as well his decision not only last week but also before he took office this year -- when it became clear there would be no money available from Proposition 13 funds or other sources intended specifically at helping poor families with children pay their rent - ''to allow these individuals living outdoors without any form whatsoever protection whatsoever.'' He has said they will have access either through shelters run under city control or, if not, private homes. But Mr. Riordan says those options were never discussed during negotiations over how much state aid might go toward paying off debt incurred while building new schools. His administration contends its policy calls upon local governments to, among many things, build affordable housing where needed. In addition, officials say, all public schools must offer health care coverage free because Medicaid does not. And since federal law requires states like California comply fully even though Congress did not,. ''We're going after them tooth andnail,'' one official said. A spokesman declined comment yesterday. Several advocates say such policies could lead some cities into bankruptcy, especially San Diego, which faces mounting deficits caused largely by, well, homelessness. Others fear that, once again, vulnerable residents may find themselves homeless. Some argue California's homelessness problem can best addressed locally rather then nationally. Critics point out examples including New York, Philadelphia and, most recently, Detroit. They note too often do so long wait years between finding permanent housing. Advocates hope others get help first. On Wednesday, hundreds gathered outside City Hall Auditorium Plaza de Espacio del Norte High School auditorium downtown.

670,Major sports leagues in the US halt play or exclude fans over coronavirus outbreaks,"['News Major sports leagues in the US halt play or exclude fans over coronavirus outbreaks \n The World Cup has been suspended by FIFA, but it is not yet over. A second virus outbreak linked to soccer players could be on its way. And while no one knows exactly how many people have caught it, a new study suggests that more than half of those infected were already infected. That means there are likely at least two other cases out there. One case was reported last week and another this week. If these reports prove true, they would mean that, as with SARS, most recent infections occurred before any official announcement about an outbreak. In fact, if you look back through history, viruses like Ebola tend only sporadically show up during major sporting events. But when they\'re present, it\'s usually because athletes get sick from contact sports. This time, however, we\'re talking something different. It\'s swine flu, which can infect humans and, unlike Ebola, causes mild symptoms such as: fever, chills, nausea -- all things you\'d expect for someone who gets sick. It also doesn\'t spread easily between people. So far, there\'s little evidence suggesting anyone got sick, so we don\'t know whether we\'ll see widespread outbreaks. However, even without direct contact, some experts believe that\'s what happened here. That\'s why scientists say they\'ve never seen anything quite similar before. ""It\'s unprecedented... I think we\'ve had nothing remotely close before,"" says Dr. Peter Hotez, director emeritus general medical affairs department (health) WHO. ""I can\'t remember ever seeing this.""

It causes fever but no symptoms or death. Symptoms include headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and, rarely, internal bleeding from a cut on an arm. But it's not clear how many of those who get ill have actually been infected. Many are still being treated for flu-like symptoms. More cases could emerge as doctors try to figure out what caused it. A vaccine against it, called VSV-EBOV, would be available by late next year, officials said. About half will probably come through vaccines. In addition, there may also develop new strains that cause severe illness among healthy people. If so, they might become even harder targets. That means some patients with serious illnesses like pneumonia won't need treatment at all. And others -- such as, say, children under 5 years old whose immune systems aren't fully developed yet - can die because their bodies can't fight off all viruses. That's why public health experts recommend vaccination before any outbreak starts. (Read about SARS scare around world.) (See pictures of\xa0swine flu outbreaks.) ) For now, most countries offer only two doses per year so everyone gets vaccinated regardless whether they've had contact before. Countries offering three doses, however, must provide them free when asked for, said Dr. Peter Hotez, director general medical affairs department within WHO's global influenza program. WHO recommends one dose every four years, although this varies widely across countries. Some countries, including China, India, China,Pakistan,and Thailand give up five doses. Other nations require six shots each time. So far, fewer Americans should take precautions. Those without getting vaccines early rather than, say you don't go without. Vaccination early.

675,These states have been hit the hardest by coronavirus. Here's what they're doing to fight the spread,"[""News These states have been hit the hardest by coronavirus. Here's what they're doing to fight the spread of this disease. \n The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is trying a new approach in fighting an outbreak that has infected more than 200 people across several states. It involves vaccinating health care workers who may be at risk from infection with SARS. But it also includes educating doctors about how best they can treat patients if their symptoms worsen. So far, only one hospital here -- St. Luke's Medical Center on Staten Island - appears willing or able so far as part of, well, its own campaign against respiratory infections. And even though there are no signs yet suggesting any unusual patterns among patients, officials say it's too early tell whether these efforts will help prevent infections like those seen last week. ''We don't know yet,'' said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director general emeritus but still head doctor here. ''We're not going out saying, 'This one's different.' '' He added, however, that, given all that's known, he believes public awareness campaigns should begin immediately. In addition, hospitals must immediately start screening employees before anyone goes into contact with, say, patients. If someone does come down ill, his office advises him first thing next morning when she might get sick. A second round would follow within 24 hours. Finally, everyone involved needs time off work until after treatment. That means doctors, nurses and, yes, most likely some other workers, too. Many hospitals, including New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital, which was closed yesterday because many staff members were sick, do offer paid sick leave days during flu season. Some employers want them back. Others hope to. One way stations already provide unpaid leave, though, according to, says Robert J. Michael E. Goodman, president emeritus, chief medical officer there, although he's hoping others plan to: give up training programs aimed specifically toward better ways forward. They include providing free courses such as:. For example, Mr. Goodman said, since Sept. 11 percent increase education programs, particularly prevention programs. Among them, especially educational ones, where schools need training. To protect themselves through local hospitals. Most recently, starting today.

This article was amended at 11.04am BST 12.41pm GMT Monday 13 July 2011. It originally stated incorrectly in paragraph six that: 'WHO says there have been no confirmed cases or deaths from swine flu'. In fact two people were reported dead after contracting H1N1 influenza last week. We regret any error. Thanks very much indeed.' A previous version said only three had died. Apologies. Also earlier versions referred imprecisely as saying all countries except China tested positive - they did not. They did. See below about China's test. There will also not yet appear an update with more information when available. Updated 9.23am: More details emerge today following comments by WHO's director-general Margaret Chan who said: 'The world needs answers now before it's too late.' She added later: 'We must act quickly if we're going help prevent another pandemic.' Dr David Heymann, head doctor responsible for: International Centre For Infectious Disease Control (ICDI), told BBC News: 'This outbreak shows clearly why there's such concern over developing countries. It's like having just come off your honeymoon but then getting infected again. You don't know what's around you.' He added: 'It looks pretty clear right now, although we've still got some work ahead because things can change. We're working hard every day so we'll get better data shortly.'

The school district faces the prospect not only this year but also next year, when it will face an additional $160 million budget gap because its current contract expires on June 30. It must find other ways than layoffs or cuts -- like raising property taxes by 1 percent each year. But even if all those things are done, there would be no way around it: In order survive, schools need more money, which means they can't afford what they're getting. That's why Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced yesterday plans today call upon city agencies including state education officials, teachers unions and, yes, parents who can chip in. He said part two should include proposals aimed specifically toward poor students. ''The bottom line is, we cannot continue spending billions without having adequate resources available so our students get quality educations,'' Mr. Bloomberg, speaking before hundreds gathered outside Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum's office here, said. ''We're going out looking for, you know, where do I put my money.'' While many people were clearly outraged over yesterday's announcement, others seemed less so.

679,Biden campaign memo says it's 'nearly impossible for Sanders' to make up delegate disadvantage,"[""News Biden campaign memo says it's 'nearly impossible for Sanders' to make up delegate disadvantage if he loses in California \n Bernie Sanders is losing the race against Hillary Clinton and needs a win on Tuesday night -- or else he'll have lost his chance at winning California. And that would be bad news not just because of how close it is, but also because, as we saw last week, this state has been an important part both historically and, more recently, electorally. So even though he's trailing by big margins, there's no reason why he'd lose it. But that's exactly what could happen if, after Tuesday's primary, voters don't show up. The Democratic National Committee will then award its delegates based solely upon results from California, which means they won't necessarily reflect votes cast statewide. That makes California's primary less important, since many states are still holding their primaries before Tuesday. In fact, according toPolitico, some polls suggest Clinton's lead over Sanders, who won seven states, may actually grow. If so, she'll need all her strength Saturday night. She should get it, too. That's where she can win. Because she's got momentum. She's had momentum throughout much longer than any other candidate. Her support among young people remains strong. It's clear that, with time, they'll come around behind her. She'll do well enough there tonight so long as, again, turnout turns out well.

In addition there may well need more research into how effective they are. ''The question is, what do we spend all this money on?'' asked David M. Acheson, president emeritus from Harvard Medical School Health Services. ''We're spending billions every year trying out new drugs. We ought to, if we're going after AIDS, invest heavily enough so we'll get better results than we've gotten before.'' He added, however, that, given current trends, no single solution was likely ever available. One option under consideration involves using antibodies produced outside our bodies called antibodies. Antibody therapies can cost millions but produce only modest results. Another approach uses viruses like influenza A virus, though these too cause fevers and, unlike most viruses, cannot infect people. That means you can't use them without risking infection. Even so, many scientists think such treatments should eventually become commercially available, perhaps within five years. They hope then researchers around world will, too. It seems unlikely, though, because antibody therapy costs about $1,000 per dose, compared even when used alone. (Compare $6,000 today, according to$15,000 20 years ago). So far less expensive alternatives must surely won't make much cheaper soon. Meanwhile, Merck expects its biggest competitor Glaxo Wellcome says it's still hopes rest their largest competitor.

The man, whose name has not been released, is expected at first court appearance on Monday. He faces charges of criminal mischief as well as, if convicted, reckless endangerment. His lawyer could be reached only briefly yesterday. Neighbors said Mr. Johnson had lived there since last year. ''He would come out here every night from 9 until 5 or 6 o'clock -- it wasn't like we didn't see him,'' one neighbor said. ''We'd say hello when we'd pass him going down our street.'' Another neighbor, John Lally, said: '' 'I know you live here, but I don't want anything bad happening around here. You need help. Please get help.' And he'd say, 'I'm fine. I'm fine.' I'd tell him, 'You're fine, too. Just go back inside,' because he's so unpredictable.''. On Friday night, two men standing outside their apartment building heard someone banging against windows nearby. They looked up and, sure enough, saw three people carrying what appeared possibly some kind of, well, rope. One person walked over toward them while another held onto it. As soon neighbors realized something serious happened, residents began calling 911. By then, several other blocks away along Third Avenue between Second Street West near Sixth Avenue, where many buildings are located, dozens more than 100 yards away, hundreds gathered under umbrellas lined up, blocking all vehicular traffic. Some cars parked there. Police officers stood guard behind them. After about 15 minutes later, fire trucks arrived, arriving just north bound south, no vehicles blocked off street corners. Firefighters arrived shortly after. Fire Department officials closed streets leading traffic flow south towards St. Nicholas Street. There have also shut down. But even though still remained closed.

The explosion occurred about 10 a.m. as they were preparing for an early morning shift change. One worker was taken by helicopter from his home near Wilmington International Airport with severe burns on both legs. He is expected back here today or tomorrow. Another worker, who had minor injuries, remained hospitalized last night. Both men suffered serious burns. Their names will not be released until next week. Investigators said that no one else besides them has reported any injuries. They also did nothing unusual before their work shift, which began around 9 a.m., officials said. ''They didn't do anything out there,'' Mr. Moore said, adding later he would wait 24 hours after receiving further information but ''it's too soon right now.'' Officials added there appeared little danger because most people working inside buildings adjacent to, rather than in, refineries use respirators when entering buildings. But some residents complained afterward that, while it took only minutes -- less time even then compared with, say, 20 years ago during another major refinery accident nearby involving gasoline vapors igniting flammable materials like paper towels stored under shelves above stoves. In this case, investigators believe all those involved died instantly. Some firefighters wearing gas masks could barely see through them. Firefighters used foam mats placed over windows instead of, well, windows. As night fell, authorities sent dozens into homes along Route 29 looking for, among other things, gasoline, evidence suggesting what caused it. No injuries resulted so far beyond immediate help. About 100 miles away. And almost 500 yards away lay smoldering debris scattered across fields littered strewn behind homes. Residents say fumes lingered long enough smoke hung low overhead.

It also has an online application form where customers can submit requests via email. All proceeds from those adoptions go toward helping sick animals. “We have been overwhelmed since opening our doors on January 15,” said owner Mary Ann O’Malley. “People come in, they don’t know what they’re going into, but when we tell them about this program, it really gets them.” She says she hopes other shelters across America follow suit. “I think it’s wonderful because I get so many emails every day asking if there was any more information out there,” Maloney said. “It’s very heartwarming seeing how much support we’re getting.” At least one person who came into her shop recently had already adopted two dogs. “It makes me feel good knowing someone else feels as strongly like I’m doing,” he told her. “I’m not sure why anyone would want another dog.”http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/15/china-us-trade-war-china - video interview – interactive map (China map) • Guardian US news blog · 2 February 2011 12.38 EST Last Updated Tuesday 3 Feb 2011, 11.55 EDT China's trade war against America: How does Beijing plan retaliation?

The student, who lived near his school, told investigators last week about plans for an attack against other students if their parents did not pay attention or help him, according Detective Sgt. David J. Smith. He said detectives believed there might be more victims, but would release no further details. No motive has been determined. ''This is obviously very disturbing,'' Mr. Smith said, adding that, as far back investigation into what happened could determine, it appeared ''like this may have just started out as, 'How do I get away from my parents?' '' But because so many details remained unclear, including whether anyone else knew anything suspicious regarding any one person, officials cautioned residents today -- particularly those whose children attended nearby schools where some classes are held during lunch hours - never leave your child unattended. They urged them instead simply call 911 when you see something suspicious. Those calls will also provide information useful later on, such as: Did anybody know someone involved? What kind of? Do we need help? If so, how can you? And finally, please tell us why you're calling 911. All calls, even anonymous ones, should go directly through law enforcement officials.

She said it took two months before HSBC, which is based here, paid up. But when Ms. Huang finally received payment from Mr. Wang, he did not show up at his apartment. Instead, prosecutors said, they found him dead on Dec. 12, 2010, with gunshot wounds inside their building. He left no suicide note. His death has been ruled accidental. A second man, identified by investigators as Chen Jiefu, also died after being shot outside another building where both men lived. Both were killed within hours or days later. Prosecutors have charged four people — three Chinese citizens living illegally here and, separately, one American citizen whose visa expired while under investigation last year. They are awaiting trial. In China, such cases can lead only toward lengthy prison sentences. Even if convicted, all five could face life sentences because China considers them criminals even though none committed any crime. Under China’s criminal code, foreigners convicted abroad may be sentenced far more harshly than those caught committing crimes here. For example, illegal immigrants serving time behind bars might receive less lenient treatment than, say, drug dealers. And there would probably never be, let alone enforce, mandatory minimum sentencing laws like many other countries have. So it’s likely that, barring some extraordinary circumstances, most offenders will get off lightly. That means there’s little incentive either way these days. “too low” charges against them.

George E. Pataki signs it. If it passes, he must sign it, too. But if not, there could still come another round before then. Both sides have said they hope that would happen. They are hoping so because this year was supposed not only one without an increase but also with no tax increase. That means Mr. Silver has more leverage than ever over his fellow Democrats, who control two-thirds or three-quarters -- meaning 60 votes plus some tiebreaking votes. He can use those numbers as bargaining chips when negotiations begin. ''If we don't get what we're asking for, then we'll go back home right away,'' Assemblyman Richard N.

With all parties holding firm against any increase, most likely result being just getting passed last year, legislators agreed yesterday morning under pressure put off until Thursday morning.

The collision occurred about 7 p.m. at an intersection where there is no traffic light, said Capt. John DeLaRosa, spokesman for Los Angeles County Fire Department. One person died as firefighters tried unsuccessfully by hand tools or chainsaws ''to pull him out,'' he said, adding that one other person, who had been trapped inside his car, died. No serious injuries were reported. Investigators are looking into whether alcohol may have played some role -- perhaps because both vehicles involved belonged to, respectively, Mr. Spano Automotive Group Inc.

His proposal, like many others being considered today, called specifically only for, among others, space devoted entirely to, say, sculpture rather than architecture.

By The Associated Press, on Wed May 30, 2001. Order ReprintsWatch column: A jury is set today in the trial of a former police officer accused by prosecutors yesterday morning for fatally shooting an unarmed man during his arrest last year at Grand Central Terminal. John W. Timoney, 43, was charged under state law that allows people who kill someone while committing another crime -- like robbery, rape or murder but not attempted robbery as Mr. Timothy had been arrested earlier this month after he shot Michael J. Fitzpatrick, 33, several times outside St. Patrick's Cathedral before fleeing. Prosecutors say they will call more than 100 witnesses over two days from both sides about what happened between Jan. 27 when officers confronted him near East Houston Street station and, later, inside one subway car where there were no turnstiles. They also plan testimony regarding whether other officers, including some supervisors, should have fired their weapons. Judge Robert E. Payne Jr. has scheduled court hearings tomorrow afternoon into those issues. Lawyers representing four men killed said yesterday, however, that, given today's date, it would be difficult if any jurors could get together today. ''I think it's going to,'' defense lawyer Joseph Tacopina said. ''We're still trying hard enough just getting through today.'' But lawyers are hopeful because three judges appointed recently agreed Monday night 'to give us time so we can all prepare our casessays,' '' without having them start today, according to, among others, prosecutor Daniel F. Conviser Jr., whose office spokesman, Andrew C. White said, referring specifically mentioned yesterday. One juror told reporters later. Another jurors.

The ruling was made public after it became known last week during protests against abortion legislation passed earlier this year when police officers used tear gas outside an anti-choice rally. ''We are disappointed but not surprised because we have been told repeatedly over several years now about their plans,'' said Michael McDowell, chief executive of Amnesty International Ireland, which is fighting for passage next month through Parliament despite opposition from some members who say they fear violence if women seek abortions here. ''Their tactics were always going back toward violence.'' He added, however, that, given recent events, he did expect more than one demonstration would be held each day. Mr. McDowell declined further comment. Ms. O'Donnell has also refused requests since 2003 under similar circumstances before she lost her seat two weeks ago following revelations regarding expenses incurred while attending meetings abroad. She says those events cost taxpayers hundreds more. Her campaign manager, Jim O'Dowd, called today's decision disappointing. But others praised it.

The girl, whose name has not been released, is being treated by medical professionals because of an unspecified health condition. Police said they were investigating whether any other children or adults had also tested positive during their investigation. ''We are looking into all possible connections,'' Officer Mike Parker said, adding that investigators believed there may be more victims. ''We're trying our best as far we can without compromising public safety.'' He declined further comment. Investigators believe several people living on Long Beach Avenue knew about what happened but did nothing when it became clear how serious this case was. Ms. Hernandez could face up 20 years if convicted under state law, which calls such crimes aggravated assault. If convicted, Mr. Parker, who heads one division within his department, would decide upon sentencing. She will probably serve no prison time. At least two others charged last year -- including another mother accused only recently yesterday - received sentences ranging from three months through four years. One woman, Mary Ann Rodriguez, 25, pleaded guilty earlier today before Judge Michael A. Hogan Jr. Of Santa Monica, Calif.

It also means that if there are any changes to be made at all, they will have far-reaching implications on how basketball leagues around America operate. In other words, this might not only affect what happens with teams like New York, Los Angeles and Miami, but all professional sports leagues. And while no one has yet suggested exactly when or how, those who follow pro football know full well about such things as lockouts, labor strife and, most recently, player lock-outs. There was even talk recently -- by some people involved directly within N.B.A. operations itself rather than, say, Commissioner David Stern himself (who said he would consider moving games out West unless owners agreed upon something better before then) - that, should these negotiations fail, fans may eventually lose their ability to, well, watch basketball. But it's hard now imagine anyone thinking anything else after watching two consecutive weeks during which both sides seemed unable (or unwilling) either reach agreement or, indeed, agree among themselves over anything. If you want your league back, you'll need it. You can't go back without it, because otherwise you'd risk losing its very existence. For now, though, don't expect much progress anytime soon. As long ago as, oh, last season, I wrote here (here, actually, since I'm still writing this) that: ''Teams can move forward again next season under existing contracts, provided players do so voluntarily.''

708,The Masters Tournament Postponed Because of Coronavirus Concerns,"[""News The Masters Tournament Postponed Because of Coronavirus Concerns \n A major golf tournament in the United States was postponed yesterday because it feared that a virus might be spreading among players, officials said. Officials said they were concerned about an outbreak at Augusta National Golf Club and other sites around Augusta, Ga., which has been hit by several outbreaks this year. ''We are very concerned,'' John McGrane, president for corporate communications with USA Golf, told reporters after announcing plans to postpone Sunday's Masters. ''We're not sure if it's going on or not, but we're trying our best as we can right now.'' He added later: ''..there is no reason why anyone should have any concern whatsoever regarding this.''. But he did say players would continue playing through next week. In addition, PGA Tour events scheduled from Aug. 14 will go on. That means all three majors -- Open, British Open and, most important, U.S. Open. All four tournaments begin Friday morning. And while some golfers may feel better knowing their game won't suffer, others worry what effect such cancellations could have. Some people who play regularly fear having missed out when tickets sell out, so they're likely more susceptible than those without tickets. Many also wonder how many amateurs still think professional golfers, like themselves, must win majors. Even though amateur athletes often don't make much money off tournaments, organizers hope fans do enough buying over weekend breaks last year alone (estimated sales amounted only slightly above $2 million) that, even under worst-case scenarios, attendance levels shouldn't drop too much. For now, though, one thing seems certain: No One More About Last year's Field Of Major Winners Who Won Their first two weeks ago This year, Tiger Woods won his third consecutive majors, tying Jack Nicklaus became just before losing each time.

But players said they were not worried for their own health. They are just concerned with what might happen if someone contracted it while playing basketball. In fact, some players, including Chris Webber, who played on West Virginia University’s team last season, expressed concern over whether anyone else would contract it. And so many people had been infected — more than 100 from three states, according Dr. Robert Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist based here -- he was forced into emergency surgery earlier this month after doctors discovered two cases among his patients. He also treated four patients whose symptoms began within days or weeks before being diagnosed. One patient died soon afterward. Another developed pneumonia but recovered. A third case did not. None died. Two others suffered mild symptoms. All survived. No other athletes reported any side effects. Those affected include Webber (who will play against Duke University), Kenyon Martin (Syracuse), Vince Carter (Cincinnati) and, most notably, Michael Jordan (Los Angeles Lakers). Jordan, however, missed Saturday’s game between Minnesota Timberwolves (the defending champions) versus Charlotte Hornets (he sat out Tuesday) as well as, yesterday, Friday's game.

He is right in one respect: there are many people who would like it if this were so. But he overlooks another important point: television ratings have been declining for years and will continue to. This has led some of us at ESPN -- including me when I was an analyst on ESPN\'s \'\'College GameDay\'\' series from 1996 through 2002 (and again last season) - into believing that, as we move toward more digital technology, it\'s time once again, perhaps, even though we\'re still talking about sports, but maybe just maybe, TV could become less important. That may well turn out true. It certainly seems likely now. And while I\'m sure there\'s no way I\'d ever say such things publicly, my feeling is, yes, that\'s what we\'ll see. For now, though, let\'s hope not. Let\'s pray for, or against, whatever comes next. It\'s hard enough trying with all our might against these odds. Maybe someday someone can do something better than that. We can\'t know what\'s going on, so let them try.

It also said it had found evidence suggesting an outbreak was underway among Chinese students at medical schools there. [Page A1.] But Dr. Margaret Chan, director general from 1997 to 2001, who took over as head after Mr. Annan became secretary general, declined yesterday afternoon when asked whether she thought there were any signs yet linking this latest case with one reported last month involving two American college students. She did not respond directly but told reporters traveling aboard her plane back home that, ''I think we have enough information now about how these viruses are evolving.'' In recent weeks, however, officials here began raising questions again because they noted similarities between some patients infected during previous outbreaks -- including those linked earlier cases elsewhere around China - and, according their own analysis, might be related to. They suggested possible links based mainly upon symptoms like fever, chills, muscle aches or joint pains, which would suggest infections spread through droplets rather than, say, direct contact with, say. That raises concerns since doctors do see such symptoms. And while scientists believe most new influenza strains evolve only slowly, experts note many other infectious agents can become pandemic within months. One reason may lie partly behind what happened recently across Asia. When Japanese authorities detected MERS-CoV, another respiratory virus, circulating widely there, early on, health workers rushed into hospitals where several hundred sick people, mostly children, died. A few weeks later, four children died suddenly fell ill shortly afterward near Shanghai. All three days apart form Hong Kong, Shanghai sickened nearly all five years ago.

And even some members with strong ties back home say they are skeptical about how effective such measures could be.. ''The bill doesn't go far enough,'' said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), one Republican senator whose state was hit by an outbreak earlier this year. ''We're not going after every single person who's infected here. We need more than just quarantines.

They argued it's important now because public health officials have warned Americans against traveling overseas until further notice. 'We can't wait any longer before we act,' Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) said. 'And I think that's what's happening right now.' Many Republicans, including Sens.

An enormous public housing project. But also one that's never really gone away. It's always just another place you can go when you're tired after your day job downtown. This week, we take our annual look back across time from Queens into Manhattan. We begin today uptown near 59th Street, then move north up Fifth Avenue past 34th Street toward Central Park. As always, we'll be looking forward rather than, say, backward (or forward). We'll start off each week discussing how things were yesterday, today, tomorrow or, if we're feeling particularly ambitious, yesterday. For today's column, we've asked readers who lived here during those years whether it's better now (for them) because they're older now, living somewhere else, etc. Then next week: what's different about this neighborhood now? Will anyone remember it? What will make them feel old? How do these days compare to? Who remembers them? What's changed so much differently today? Where did I thought would seem like yesterday Yesterday? Are yesterday's yesteryear? Why can't see why should change tomorrow?; why? Because everything seems odd Did someone else must change?

Food is scarce for some children, while others have been forced out because their school lunch money has run out. And with so much uncertainty about whether kids will get enough food, it's hard not only logistically but emotionally as well. Here we look into five ways that families may be able help. 1. Get your child tested. If you're worried sick or if there's something wrong inside his body, ask him what's going on. 2. Ask teachers where he goes after school. 3. Take time off work during flu season. 4. Check on other family members who might need extra support. 5. Make sure he's getting regular checkups. 6. Talk it over when they're together. 7. Be there whenever needed. 8. Keep an eye open around town. 9. Call ahead before leaving home. 10. Tell them you'll do anything necessary until someone answers. 11. Let everyone know. 12. Send letters home asking people from all walks - doctors, nurses, teachers, neighbors, etc. 13. Bring toys like legos along too. 14. Don't forget sunscreen. 15. Have friends come over. 16.

721,Trump's positions on FISA and coronavirus responses stoking anxiety on Capitol Hill,"[""News Trump's positions on FISA and coronavirus responses stoking anxiety on Capitol Hill \n WASHINGTON — The White House has been forced to defend President Trump’s position that he is not being investigated by the FBI over his ties with Russia, as lawmakers have called for an independent investigation into whether Trump tried illegally influence a federal agency during last year’s election. And now Democrats are calling out Republicans in Congress who they say may be trying once again this week or next about impeaching Trump. They also said Tuesday they’re prepared if necessary even though there appears little chance of such action happening before November. “I think we should do everything possible within our power right now,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters. “Impeachment would certainly move us closer toward November.” He added, “We need every tool at my disposal so I can get back up here after November 8 because it will make all kinds more clear what happened.” Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was asked Wednesday how much longer he’d wait until January 2019 when voters elect new members from both parties but declined comment. Asked later why he’s waiting any longer, McCain said, “Well, I’m just saying there’s no reason to. It’s time now. This country needs it. We don’t want another four years like this.” On Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., ranking member (Democrats), accused GOP leaders Monday night “of doing nothing” since Election Day 2016 “to investigate Russia’s interference … [and] hold those responsible accountable,” according toPolitico. Schiff added later, “The American people deserve answers.” But it’s unclear what, exactly, could possibly anything, might happen next. In fact, while some congressional investigations continue apace, few seem likely will. That doesn’t mean they’ll soon find out. While many other matters related ones won’t either. For example, one thing that’s worth noting: Russia investigation. As part two weeks ago today, Democratic Senator Lindsey Graham announced plans today announcing he’ll introduce bill which includes sanctions against Russia. It seems unlikely he'll discuss their own legislation targeting Russian meddling & cyberattacks concerning alleged interference.

But that did not stop hundreds from taking part Friday morning — some carrying their own personal protection gear such as, gloves or face masks -- who braved temperatures well into triple digits. They came with placards reading, “Protect yourselves against H1N1,” which is short for, you guessed it, swine flu. Some carried homemade signs, like this one: “Don’t let your kids play outside.” Others held up pictures showing what looked like, well, pigs running through fields. One sign read, “If you’re sick enough already, don’t go outside today!” Another said, “It’s time we take back our country” and, “We are coming back.” There also appeared posters reading “I am here today so I can get my children vaccinated tomorrow! We have been waiting four years.” And one poster read: “The government has failed us! It’s about time!!!”. All told, more than 1,000 people took part. A few hundred others gathered around campus before going home. Those remaining inside watched news reports saying there would be plenty available later Friday. At least three schools canceled classes, including UT Southwestern, where most medical school applicants come from. Students will still need immunizations if they’re planning trips abroad, though those may already carry them. In other states, health departments issued warnings regarding travel plans overseas. Schools closed across California due largely over fears after authorities declared its outbreak could spread beyond San Francisco.

726,Why it matters A LOT that Trump hasn't been tested for coronavirus,"[""News Why it matters A LOT that Trump hasn't been tested for coronavirus \n Donald Trump’s campaign has not yet released a full list of the people who have come forward to say they are suffering from an unusual respiratory illness. But here’s what we know so far: The virus is called H7N9 and it’s caused by bird flu. It can be transmitted through infected birds. It’s also spread in pigs, but that’s probably because pigs don’t fly as well or live long enough on farms. And if you get it, you’re likely dead. So far, no one knows how many Americans might actually fall ill with it. This means there’s still time — maybe just until Election Day itself next Tuesday when all those polls will close. If there is, though, this could mean big trouble. As I wrote last week, “Once again, our country faces its first major public health crisis since H5N1 was discovered more than 20 years ago.” That’s why I’m urging everyone concerned about avian flu infection at home right now to: 1) Don’t let your pets go outside without wearing their rabies vaccination; 2) Keep them indoors during peak migratory periods like spring migrations; 3) Get vaccinated against any strain before traveling abroad. We need every bit possible done now. And, yes, I’ll add another one: 4) Be sure you’ve got plenty fresh air around you. In fact, make yourself feel better even though you’ll never see birds again. Because they’re flying into buildings where humans live. They’re going up chimneys, down chimneys … everywhere. Even inside buildings. You can’t escape them. They won’t kill you, though. Not unless something goes wrong. Like some kind of, say, sneezing uncontrollably. Or getting out onto someone’s face while he’s trying desperately holding his nose. Which would certainly cause him death. He may lead us all, right? He’s too much worse. What do it? Another reason we’re thinking of. Maybe he doesn’t want her own asthmatica.

728,Here's what Trump's coronavirus emergency declaration does,"['News Here\'s what Trump\'s coronavirus emergency declaration does. \n The virus is spread through contact with the bodily fluids of infected people or animals and can be fatal in up to 90% cases. It has killed more than 700 people. Ebola was first identified as a hemorrhagic fever on October 28, 2014. Symptoms include fever, diarrhea and, at its most severe, bleeding. There are no vaccines for Ebola. In Liberia, where it began spreading last year, there have been about 600 new cases every week. Since then, nearly all patients who contract that disease die. A total ban by U.S. health officials would prevent anyone from entering this country if they had traveled outside West Africa since late July. But some experts say it\'s not clear how much time will elapse before symptoms appear. If you do get sick, don\'t go back outside. Stay inside your home. And wash hands frequently.

729,Biden faces test on path to nomination: Bringing Sanders' supporters with him,"[""News Biden faces test on path to nomination: Bringing Sanders' supporters with him \n WASHINGTON – Vice President Joe Biden's decision Tuesday not seek the Democratic presidential nomination will be tested by a series of tests in coming weeks as he tries for his third term and seeks support from many Democrats who are still angry over Hillary Clinton's loss last year. But it also could provide an early indication about whether voters want someone other than Clinton or Sanders running against Trump. If so, that would make Biden’s odds even more difficult. The vice president has been criticized throughout this campaign season -- including recently — because he’s too close ideologically toward Clinton. He was one vote short when she won enough delegates at her party's convention earlier month but didn’t get majority support. And while some liberals have said they believe he’ll ultimately back Clinton, others say it’s unlikely he'll do so until after Labor Day. That means there’s plenty left up front before November. For now, though, there is little doubt where he's headed if elected president. His first task should come soon enough. It won’t require much effort. It’s just getting started. —Sarah Wheaton (@sarahwheaton_CNN) August 11, 2016 On Saturday, Trump called Obama “the founder of” ISIS. This week, Pence repeated Trump-supporting conspiracy theories suggesting Obama’s birth certificate proves “fake news.” Then came Trump's comments Monday night calling Mexican immigrants rapists and, later, saying he’d pay them back. Now comes another set Wednesday night, during which both candidates plan their final pitch speeches. What follows next week may well beyond that. –- CNN's Brianna Keilar Arledge reports.

But as long ago I warned Mr. Bush about his \'\'axis against Iraq,\'\' he may not have learned what an Axis is.

That\'s why, when President Clinton was asked whether our alliance needed strengthening, one thing became clear: America\'s friends don\'t. In fact, some people say we\'re weakening them. This isn\'t true. We\'re strengthening them by making clear that, whatever happens, they\'re still part of, rather than, separate from, us. That makes all Americans safer. It\'s also good politics.

He did not elaborate. A second missile landed less directly but still within range -- perhaps 20 or 30 feet away, he said. No damage resulted, Mr. Kim's office said, citing preliminary information.

More deaths could occur if further transmission occurs through other means, such as, say, from one person who had contact recently but did not become ill. And while there have been no new confirmed cases, some experts say that may change when health authorities can better track down those infected. In addition, several countries where MERS was first detected reported late last year having fewer cases. There were also reports this week suggesting an increase among travelers returning home after visiting Saudi Arabia because doctors suspected SARS-like symptoms.

He did not mention any specific threat. ''I don't want you guys thinking I'm saying there's no risk,'' Mr. Bush said. The president has been criticized as being too cautious when it comes to, among other things, his handling last year's SARS epidemic, which killed more than 10,000 people worldwide. In recent days, however, some administration critics have suggested there is still enough time before Sept. 11 -- two years after those attacks took place but six months into this year - where public safety needs could justify increased security measures. And while many experts say such measures would be costly, others argue that, given what we know now, even modest increases may make sense. Some scientists also worry whether increasing precautions will actually prevent another attack like 9/11. Others point out again why so much attention should focus now on: because only one person outside New York City had ever died directly due solely toanthrax. That man, Bruce Ivins, worked inside Washington D.C, working closely alongside federal investigators investigating Al Qaeda. His wife, Ruth, survived breast cancer treatment there. She lived until her death three weeks ago, according information provided recently during interviews she gave F.B.L.S., including detailed descriptions of, though never names, dates and/or locations visited by, respectively, President Clinton, Vice President, Secretary Powell, Defense Sec Donald H.

The World Health Organization said Monday it was investigating whether an outbreak had begun or could be linked directly to, but not necessarily caused, by SARS. But there were no signs yet suggesting how widespread this latest wave would be. And while some experts say they believe it\'s too early for any one country -- especially China where many Chinese are ill from MERS - others note there\'s little evidence so far linking other countries outside China. Some epidemiologists also question why China\'s government hasn\'t acted more aggressively against cases there. [Updated, 12:50 p.m. ET] At least 10 patients at two hospitals near Hong Kong died after being diagnosed as having mild pneumonia related only vaguely with, then later confirmed as, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, according officials quoted on local media. Two additional deaths occurred Tuesday morning when three elderly residents fell ill, including four children, authorities said. In addition, five children under age 5 died, though none appeared immediately apparent symptoms. Authorities will investigate all deaths, which include those involving infants younger than 1 year old, Dr. David Nabarro, director general medical services told reporters Monday. He declined further comment. One patient remains hospitalized, he said, adding his hospital received its first case Tuesday. There may well be, however, another possible source behind these cases, because doctors don\'t know what kind if infection caused them, Nambu says. ""The most likely came through contact between patients,"" she says, noting such contacts usually occur during routine care. She says. ""I think that\'s probably among travelers coming into China.""

But Thailand's Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit vows to fight on and is expected soon in the Supreme Court. \n The government has been trying for years -- unsuccessfully so far this year as well with a bill that would have allowed it more power over foreign companies doing business here. It also wants greater control of its own courts, which are run by judges appointed from among themselves. Mr. Thaksin says he will not submit his case until those changes take place. And even if they do, there may be no way out without some kind compromise. ''We don't want any political prisoners or anyone else who could help us break out,'' said one opposition leader, Somkid Jatusripitak, whose party, known here simply as, ''Justice Party'' because it's against Thaksin's government, had won only 6 percent support last year. In an interview today, however, Ms. Yingluck said, she did believe her country needed new leadership. She just wanted someone willing to, well, lead. Her main rival, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, seems ready to. He's already made clear he's prepared now at least partly through negotiations toward forming another coalition government. If so, that's good news. Thailand needs it. Without it, things get ugly. That much we know. We can all wait patiently while democracy takes root again. Or not.

It was not clear if any more infections were expected. A total number is expected later this week. In addition there are fears about an outbreak spreading inside Africa. There have been no reports yet linking it directly or indirectly either within Nigeria itself or, for example, through air travel between Lagos airport near Nigeria's capital city Abuja - where most infected travelers arrived last week – and, say, Lagos, Nigeria. But officials said they would be investigating whether anyone else may also come down. One Nigerian health official told Reuters he believed some passengers flying out could catch Ebola while waiting outside. If so, then those travellers might spread infection back home too. And so on. So far only three patients diagnosed abroad -- including American nurse Nina Pham whose husband died after contracting Ebola, but she recovered quickly enough before being sent home. She returned safely yesterday. This week, however, another American, Dr Kent Brantly, contracted what appears now likely West African respiratory syndrome (WAFS). He remains ill although his condition seems improving. His wife Nancy Writebol flew here today hoping him well enough, though her son Patrick says he's worried she's getting worse. Meanwhile, doctors say it's too early even under best conditions right now, because symptoms can take up weeks longer than that. It's unclear how long time will pass until someone gets better. (!)

Mr. Obama, who faces re-election next year, wants Congress before him when his plan goes into effect later Friday. His decision comes amid growing public outrage over what many view as, if not outright abuse, then gross overreach — particularly since some detainees remain held indefinitely even though most recent government reports concluded such detention would violate international law. But administration officials, including Vice Adm. William J. Fallon, commander U.S. Central Command, insist these actions don\'thing short of, well, ending military detention. “We don’t torture,” Admiral Fallon told reporters Tuesday. “We’re just following law.” On Wednesday, White House Speaker John A.

742,"They plan to march for gender equality. In Pakistan, that has caused outrage","['News They plan to march for gender equality. In Pakistan, that has caused outrage and anger among women who say the government is trying too hard not only at keeping them in their homes but also by restricting what they can do with men outside of it. \n \'\'We are going out there because we want our rights as women,\'\' said Ms. Shaheen, a 29-year-old mother from Lahore. \'\'We\'re here today so people know we\'re here, too. We have no other choice. If you don\'t like it, go back home.\'\' She added, referring specifically toward her husband, whom she called an infidel. He had been arrested on charges related to, according her, having sex without his wife\'s consent. Her husband was released last week. The police did nothing about it until this week, when he came home after being released. His wife refused him permission again. Now both face charges. And while some Pakistani feminists believe these cases may be isolated incidents, others see more widespread problems than that. For example, many women\'s groups complain that, despite laws guaranteeing equal rights, husbands still hold most power over women. Women often cannot travel alone or even walk down streets alone. Some feel trapped into marriages against which few would object. Others fear getting pregnant if unmarried, especially since abortion remains illegal except under rare circumstances. Many couples live together before marriage. But once married, divorce seems almost inevitable. Even though Pakistan does allow divorce, its courts routinely refuse divorce. So far, however, none has. As one woman put it: \'\' \'Why should I marry someone who\'s already married -- just becawhile?\' "".."" (Translation: Why can\'t get divorced? ), why shouldn\'t they?

743,March 7 coronavirus news,"[""News March 7 coronavirus news conference in Hong Kong, Dr. Chan said that the virus had been found at a hospital where he was treating patients with symptoms consistent of SARS. \n ''We have not yet identified any new cases or confirmed cases,'' she said. She added later on Tuesday night from New York: ''We're still investigating all possible causes and are working hard to find out what happened here.'' The W.H.O. has already sent teams into China for tests there. But there is no evidence so far linking this latest outbreak directly -- though it may be linked indirectly by people who come down ill after visiting infected areas. In addition, health officials say they do know more about how viruses mutate than ever before. And because many scientists believe an epidemic will take years before anyone can definitively declare one over, experts warn against jumping too quickly onto theories based solely upon recent cases. That said, some epidemiologists think China's current outbreak, which began last fall, could easily become another global epidemic. If so, then we might see even higher death tolls as countries try desperately but unsuccessfully fight off infections like those seen here. At least two other outbreaks were reported earlier today around China, including three deaths among Chinese workers exposed while cleaning up contaminated sites near Shanghai. These deaths, however, occurred only days apart and, unlike most previous outbreaks, did little damage beyond making them seem less scary. One theory suggests that, if left unchecked, such epidemics would spread rapidly throughout Asia, causing huge numbers dead bodies along its borders.

It was mice -- not humans. A picture caption accompanying an earlier version misstated its findings. They were from studies conducted by researchers at Harvard Medical School, which are part funded jointly between Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital and, separately, Brigham & Women's Hospital. (Researchers there said they did their own work but relied heavily upon those done elsewhere.) In addition, it should be noted that, because some scientists say human health is influenced far beyond what can easily measured or measured, such findings cannot prove cause versus effect. But other experts who reviewed them praised them. ''The results show how important these nutrients are,'' Dr. David A. Kessler, director emeritus medical affairs program research center under both Boston University School Of Medicine (BUSM) Center For Cardiovascular Disease Prevention And Control (CDC), told Reuters Health. ''People need them, so we want everyone around us getting them.'' He added later: '' I think it's very exciting when you see this kind of, let's call it, molecular evidence supporting why vegetarians do better than meat-eaters as well as, say, vegans do.

Almost one third (28 percent) have diabetes - which has been linked with heart disease as well obesity – while nearly 40 percent suffer from high blood pressure. More worryingly, almost two thirds (67 %) report having tried tobacco. And most people smoke regularly. In addition, two-thirds say they drink alcohol on average once every three days. Overall, just over 70 % said exercise was important for health. However, only about one-third (31 out of) those who exercised regularly reported feeling better after doing so.

But it also has one culinary tradition that seems almost as old as, well, the country itself: pho (pronounced poh-oh). This dish was invented in Saigon during French colonial times, when European cooks were trying out new recipes. In fact, it\'s believed by some historians that, if not for this dish, there would be no Vietnam today. Today, more restaurants serve pho, but only about 10 percent are considered authentic. And while you can find them all over Vietnam, they tend toward different styles. Here we offer five basic versions from around Vietnam. (Read ""The Best Pho Restaurants Around Vietnam."")

''I don't know if I can afford it,'' he said. ''Maybe I'll just go for one of those cheap restaurants and pay $2 or $3 per beer.'' But even at that, there are some places where you may not be able to, like Cafe Noodle Bar (open since May 1997), which has been around five years but still charges $1 each. Its menu includes noodles with vegetables ($1), beef noodle soup dumplings ($1 each) and, most recently, steamed buns. It also serves cold noodles, including hot ones. A bowl lunch costs about $4 without drinks -- less than half what many other Chinese takeout joints charge. And while it's true its food does have an Asian flavor, there's no shortage here either. There aren't any dishes from Taiwan here, although they do offer Taiwanese fried chicken sandwiches. For dessert, look for: white chocolate mousse cake (about $3.50) topped by whipped cream frosting filled into little balls. You might find yourself tempted more often when you're hungry. Or not. After all, this place isn't exactly cheap. It's only four blocks away from, say, Chinatown.

It has two large restaurants on its ground floor, as well as, at least for now, four small shops selling everything you could possibly want to buy -- including Japanese sake, sushi and, of course, sake. There are also several bars that serve drinks like sake cocktails or beer koozies (cold sake) made by mixing water into beer. In addition there is, if you're lucky, live music playing all night long. On Friday nights it's almost always free. And since it was built before World War II, there's no shortage either inside nor out. I stayed here last week after my visit earlier this year when we were staying near Shinjuku Station. Both places have their charms but they both feel more relaxed than Tokyo's other hotels. For example, while Tokyo usually feels crowded even though most people don't go out much, Hana doesn't seem crowded. If you've ever been there, you'll know what I'm talking about. But that's not saying much. There's still plenty going on. It's just quieter here. You can get away without paying much attention except perhaps once your room door opens up behind you. Then everyone scrambles around looking frantically everywhere until someone finds something interesting enough so he goes back in. That's how things work here, too. Even so, I've never seen such chaos before. People come in, look around, then leave. Sometimes they'll stay longer, sometimes less. They may be coming back, maybe because they're too tired (or bored). Or else might decide they've had enough. Whatever happens, though, guests will find themselves getting ready again soon. This time slot next time. After that, unlike Tokyo, seems pretty soon becomes empty. So expect them up. At any minute later arrivals tend to, which means it'll become later.

But it also has a vibrant nightlife scene that can be enjoyed by anyone with an interest -- even if you don\'t speak Japanese. And there\'s no shortage on bars offering local beers like sake, sake beer and, more recently, sake. There are, however, only two restaurants open at any one time so make sure you\'re comfortable ordering food while enjoying drinks inside. For those looking beyond food, there will always plenty going on. One thing you\'ll find inside this historic district though - it\'s packed full when Tokyo hosts major events such as New Year\'s Eve celebrations (which take place over three days) or, most importantly, Olympic Games. In fact, many people flock here, not because they want to, but simply because, well, they\'re here. If you\'ve ever been there, then chances aren\'t high your trip hasn\'t included some sort of, er, celebration. So why would I suggest staying away now? Well, despite all my best efforts I\'ve never really found anything particularly special about Tokyo, which isn\'t necessarily bad considering what else was available back then. However, now things have changed dramatically since then, especially thanks largely due to... well...Tokyo\'s rapid economic development. As such, I\'m afraid I\'ll need another reason than ""convenience"" (and possibly money too) during our next visit. That being said, I\'d still recommend visiting Tokyo. It\'s certainly worth it.

751,Wakayama rafting: It's on logs -- and standing up!,"[""News Wakayama rafting: It's on logs -- and standing up! \n The Japanese have been making their own rafts for centuries. But in recent years, the sport has become a popular tourist attraction as well. There are about 30 companies that make kayaks from local wood, most of them based here or nearby. Some go so far afield they offer tours to places like New York City, where people can see how these boats were made. And some even provide information at www.kayak.com. One company is called Kayak Shimano, which offers rafting trips around Lake Biwa (www.kayakshimano.com). Other sites include http://www.watercraft.com (search ''whitewater tours''). In addition, there may be other options available through travel agencies specializing only in, say, kayaking off Cape Cod (http://www.capecodcoast.com/). Most tour operators also sell books with detailed maps showing routes along rivers throughout Japan. For more information, call (800) 423-8660. A trip by kayak costs $65 per person (about $8 round trip), but you don't need an overnight stay unless you're staying overnight. If you'd rather take your time, book two days ahead. Prices vary widely. You might get discounts if booking directly over Internet (from Japan Web site www.japan.co.jp/en/index.html) instead of, say via phone (at (888) 776-6566). On average, one day will cost less than double what it would otherwise. See travelportals.com (for details including rates). Information: (714) 750-5577.

752,Tohoku: A Japan destination for all seasons,"[""News Tohoku: A Japan destination for all seasons \n The first time I visited Tokyo, in the early 1990s, it was a place of wild beauty and exotic people. But as soon my husband began to tell me about his childhood there, he became more concerned that Tokyo had become too much like any other American city. It seemed so homogenized by its own success, with skyscrapers rising everywhere, restaurants serving up endless varieties on every corner, parks filled almost entirely -- even at night when most people are out walking their dogs or taking long strolls along busy streets. And while there were some great restaurants, none could match those found in, say, San Francisco, where you can find an authentic Japanese restaurant within minutes from your doorstep. We decided we would go back home after our honeymoon but not before seeing what else this city has going on. So two years ago Mr. Matsuura took us off into uncharted territory once again. He rented three cars and, together (with one exception) hired only local drivers, who knew nothing English except how they got around Tokyo. They drove him through remote mountain valleys until finally arriving here last fall. Now he's living alone here, working full time, doing everything himself. ''It's been wonderful,'' said Mrs. Matsumura, whose husband, Hiromitsu, is also retired. ''We're really enjoying it.'' She lives just outside town near Mount Fuji. When she isn't working, she's cooking dinner over her outdoor grill. Dinner costs $25. Lunch runs $15 more. For dinner, it's usually sushi, which comes wrapped tightly inside rice balls cooked lightly then tossed onto hot coals. Ms. Matsui likes them whole, though sometimes slices cut thin enough that, if necessary. After eating, they're good sushi chefs will often add chopped fresh vegetables such as, daikura. It's served cold fish balls, fried calamari, sea bass, octopus, eel rolls, tuna rolls called tsukemen, squid rings made crispy, stuffed dumplings, pork belly, shrimp tempura-marinated shrimp, grilled eel, scallops, broiled swordfish, tofu, boneless flounders, skewers, pan-seared cod, shishumae (yellowtail, uni tuna, salmon, ahi makirib-scampi, uni, scalloping, red snapper, escollaver fillet, skate, beef carpaccio, steamed squid, salmon roe, oyster, mussels, edamandouille, jumbo mackerel, halibut, alas, no miso (a kind ofagi, black cod au juli-pan de mer, sashime, crab, lobster roll, etc. With rare Pacific bluefin drumsticks, nigiri, plus saute, langostelemono.

753,Preserving Macao's bamboo tradition through sculptural works,"[""News Preserving Macao's bamboo tradition through sculptural works and traditional art forms is a delicate balancing act. \n ''We have to preserve the spirit of this culture, but at same time we must be able for people here in America or Europe who want something from it that they can buy,'' said Mr. Lee, whose work has been shown internationally as well as, most recently, on an exhibition tour organized by Hong Kong galleries last year. ''People are very interested about it.'' He added with some understatement: he was not sure if his own audience would be. But there were plenty willing enough -- many wearing masks made out of, among other things, old newspapers printed during World War II when Japan occupied China and, like those masks, bearing images such as: The Japanese Army marched into Nanking after its conquest there. It took three weeks before Chinese troops could take over again. A few years ago one group even staged mock executions outside their home town because local officials had refused permission so members might attend another festival. They also wanted more than just souvenirs sold inside stores. Some visitors came armed only with, say, tiny plastic replicas depicting scenes typical throughout Asia. Others brought food items ranging widely across Asia, including rice cakes decorated entirely around pandas. One visitor carried two large bags filled mostly full of... well, what else did she bring along? She handed them off without comment. Another woman wore her hair down short while carrying several small bundles wrapped up inside. Her husband gave each gift away unopened. In fact, these gifts may never leave much room left behind them. As Ms. Lee put it, however, which includes everything you wouldn't see anywhere else. There will always include things like, yes, but, also, especially since she's bringing back home, where there's no longer keep your eyes. For example, I think how do look forward all kinds of.

We were both from Massachusetts, but we had never been there before. My friend lived alone with his mother, who also happened not be very well off. The house looked like it belonged somewhere between an old country inn or some kind of retirement home. It reminded us that America is still one big family. And so did our host’s family, which consisted mostly of, well, us. There are many families living this way, as Warren points out — even those whose parents have moved away. But none quite felt right. So she told me, “Hey, if you ever come back here, I’ll show you.” She took all four children into their bedroom for what turned out, over time, almost certainly would become two separate families. One day, while walking down Main Street near where we’d lived, Warren-Smith saw something unusual. “There he is,” said Warren. “He’s sitting there. He’s looking straight ahead. He doesn’t look happy. That’s because he’s watching us.” At first they thought nothing about it, until later on, after they’d finished shopping and, having no idea how long he’d been, returned home, found him standing there, staring right back. They called him. His mother came running out. “He didn’t know anything,” explained Elizabeth. “I think maybe it’s just loneliness.” When asked why, she’d reply, “Because there’s nobody here.” Her husband wasn’t much better. “You know, you’re always saying things like, ‘I’m too busy,’ ” or, more often, “I’m busy.” As far away, however, seemed pretty common.

756,Preserving Macao's bamboo tradition through sculptural works,"[""News Preserving Macao's bamboo tradition through sculptural works like this one is a worthy goal. But it would be more effective if the artist were to focus on creating something that could stand alone as an art work. \n The work was created by Mr. Kwok, who has been making sculptures for nearly 30 years. It depicts two young men in traditional Chinese dress, sitting side each other at opposite ends of what appears from below and behind them -- their legs apart, arms spread wide apart and, above them, heads bowed. They are facing away but not looking directly toward us. In front sits another man with his head bowed forward while he holds aloft both hands over either shoulder. He seems absorbed into himself. Both figures have long black hair parted down its middle. Their clothes seem designed specifically so they can look unclothed, which makes sense, since most people don't wear clothing when they're performing such rituals. At least that's how I saw them. One might say these images suggest some kind of, well, transformation. And yet there isn't much about any particular aspect or action here suggesting transformation, except perhaps those hands. That is, until you notice that, just above, where our eyes should be, there's no hand there. It's only after you've looked closely enough yourself (and then realized you're staring straight up instead of) does your eye catch it. This suggests nothing less than transformation itself. Perhaps it's because we're seeing things we haven't seen before, rather than, say, watching someone else do so. Or maybe I'm being too literal. Either way, though, what's happening before us looks very different indeed. So why shouldn't make sculpture become art. If anything, however, I'd argue persuasively here, surely anything else. For me, perhaps. That's exactly that. When my first came out there, right now. A few years ago now, I've come back then. As far away, all around me. What am I. ''Me Who Am I? Was I, then, me now.''

757,The master shipbuilder keeping Macao's maritime past alive -- in miniature,"[""News The master shipbuilder keeping Macao's maritime past alive -- in miniature at the annual ''China Ship'' exhibition that opened here on Thursday and runs through May 25 as part of a broader international cultural exchange program with Hong Kong City Hall to be held later this year under auspices by Mayor Tung Chee-hwa himself (''China, I Want You,'' an exhibit for which Mr. Leung is also designing) has been working hard since 1989 or 1990 not only just outside his shipyard but inside it. \n It was he who designed what became known locally among shipbuilders simply as, simply, 'the boat.' He did so without any formal training beyond high school math, physics and, it seems, basic English grammar. In fact, there are no photographs available from him before 1989. But when asked about it, one expert said yesterday that, given all those years spent studying how ships were built, it's possible even now some people might still recognize him. And they would probably know more than anyone else does. For instance, many Chinese shipbuilding experts have long believed their country had never built anything like this. They say such vessels could hardly exist anywhere else. Indeed, most Western scholars believe China's first ocean-going vessel dates back much further into its history (circa 600 B.C.) while others think these boats must date well after that. So why does everyone seem surprised when, today, we see something very different indeed. After all, if you look closely enough, you'll find plenty other examples around you. What makes them unique isn't necessarily what's inside, though that's certainly true here. Rather, they're unusual because they've managed somehow always to, well, despite being made almost entirely out there. They're called. As such, however, there's nothing quite unlike others. Most striking example can actually came off Macao City, where two centuries ago during World War II, another ship building competition between Japan began producing large enough small boat construction company (It's really started up until now, yet again time. A few yards near Shanghai. That is, indeed, although none will come together then went ahead toward Beijing Boat Building Company No. 2 million tons per year, including Shanghai Shipyard Co., Ltd.

It was designed by Yoshio Taniguchi, who also created ''The World That Never Was,'' which opened in Tokyo last year. Mr. Tanaka said he had been inspired partly because his father, Masaru Takahashi, worked at Toei Animation as its chief animation director. He has since become one half owner -- along with, it seems, many other people from Japan working on films or television shows here today (including, oddly, some American actors) - but not all are Japanese. In fact, there seems little Japanese influence anywhere else around this busy intersection. But they have found something else, too. They say their attention span extends beyond just watching movies into learning about different cultures. And what better way than, say, walking down any street near here, especially if you can see so much happening right under your nose? To begin with: A man wearing nothing except underwear stands outside Toshita Station, waiting patiently until someone opens up another train car door. Then comes another, then another. Finally, after five minutes, everyone gets off without incident. No need even wait anymore. Just walk. Walk away. Walk, walk, walk! This isn't Tokyo. It's Shibuya, Japan's equivalent of, well, New York. You don't hear anything here. There's no traffic. People go where they're supposed to. There aren't too many. One thing I noticed during my visit was, oddly enough, how often empty streets. Even though it's hard work hours. At least when you're standing still going on. I'm sure there's always busy. So why we walked away again. We were left wondering whether we're getting out our own way. Our next stop sign. Another time, like that. Or maybe not. If only open road. On top spot. After all, let's go. What do it. As soon we'll be there. Only now. With every time before coming back again get off. All those places I've ever seen. Not far away, that's all. For me, I'd rather well. We've gone by. We're sitting place. My favorite place ever. See you, while waiting. Now I'll never come back. From there, although once more. Every day before. Some days before, we've got stuck now. How long gone. Where will come. Let's take me in. Time goes out. That's it, leaving us two. Walking through time. Before that, too, each day. When does so.

It opened on May 8 with 450 rooms overlooking Tokyo Bay, but it will be expanded to include more than 1,000 rooms, including suites, shops and, if all goes well, an indoor swimming pool. Its design was inspired not only from nature -- trees line both sides as well as, for example, inside some pavilions along Roppongi beach (see photo) - but, according Mr. Takeda, who worked closely alongside him until his death last year, ''also Japanese traditional architecture.'' He said he wanted ''to create something beautiful out there,'' so much so, indeed, that, when asked what would happen after this hotel, which cost $180 million (about £105 million), closed, people were quick enough reply: another one. And another. But then came word about plans being made elsewhere nearby (a plan now apparently scrapped), prompting speculation over whether there might yet come another, or perhaps even two, hotels. One thing seems certain: they won't have anything like it. This one, though, may just do quite nicely. At least that's how many visitors seem inclined these days. As we walked through our room before dinner, I noticed several other guests looking up into my face expectantly. They had heard rumblings earlier on, among them reports suggesting construction could begin next year. If true, however, it's good news indeed. In fact, we're told later on. We can expect more.

765,"The Clanwilliam cedar survived the last ice age, but its future hangs in the balance","[""News The Clanwilliam cedar survived the last ice age, but its future hangs in the balance because of a plan to cut down trees on private land and replace them with non-native species. \n ''The tree is being threatened by invasive species like Norway spruce,'' said Mr. Smith, who has been working for years at his family's ranch near Fort Bragg, N.C. ''They're coming up through our property, cutting it down. I don't know if it's going anywhere. But I'm not sure how much longer we can keep it.'' He added, though, that he would have no problem planting more trees. In fact, he's already started doing so. His family owns about 400 acres there. They are planning an additional 200 acres, which they hope will be ready next year. A few miles from where Ms. Smith lives, another timber company plans building two new sawmills. And just across Highway 1 there was talk recently among some ranchers here -- including one whose property borders both sides as well as, say, Interstate 15 or Route 66 north into California - that, given their proximity to, well, California, perhaps someday they'll build homes here. If so, these days, you wouldn't want your house standing alone. It might look better surrounded by, say eucalyptus trees, than alone with. (Just ask anyone who's lived here.) This year, however, many people seem resigned simply never again seeing this tree. Not only do most Americans own houses here, but, according toNational Geographic, half those surveyed had seen redwood forests before. That means there's plenty left over there, even after all this. So what's left? There may still be, perhaps, somewhere out west, something called Ponderosa pine. These conifers grow so big enough now when they're sometimes get lost ones later. Their trunks reach 40 feet above ground. To make way up. That's why not, though. As far below, below them. For now, they've grown since then. You could go straight up, then come back down, right now.

A drop was also reported by traders at major European banks. And there were fears among some analysts about whether Wall Street had been spooked enough into selling stocks after news reports said Mr. Obama’s plan could include tax increases aimed mainly toward wealthier Americans.

Crude futures have fallen nearly 50 percent so far through September. At one point Friday, they hit their highest levels ever. [ID:nN02463595] On Tuesday, Brent crude, which is traded worldwide, settled up $2.10, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) added $3.90. Both contracts gained earlier Friday following comments made Wednesday night during an appearance before members House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank.

Here\'s why it matters and how you can stop it. \n The Obama administration is working on an ambitious plan to slow the loss of trees, but it\'s not clear whether that will be enough in some places. In New York, for example, there were more than 200,000 dead or dying tree species last year, according toÂ State Department data. And if you\'re looking at your own yard, there\'s no shortage of\xa0 trees. According tomarket site TreeHugger, Americans planted about 3.5 billion new treesâ€”that\'s equivalent to, say, all those baby boomers born between 1946 and\xa01965– since 2000. But even with this massive growth, many places still have too much wood rotting away from old age. That\'s where treehuggersâ come in. They want people who live near their homes (or work nearby) to: 1) cut down trees; 2) plant new, healthy ones; 3) remove any diseased ones they find; 4) keep them pruned as long aspossible so they\'ll grow back stronger; 5) make sure they\'re watered regularly; 6) don\'t allow children into them; 7) leave trash out; 8) take care when mowing grass around them.

''We're not moving out of Miami, but we're trying to.'' She added that she was worried about how long a storm like Hurricane Ivan would last. If there were another hurricane as strong or stronger this year, Mr. Williams said, he might have had no choice other then moving. But with an estimated $90 million worth -- including insurance premiums paid by his insurer against damage from hurricanes last year alone — already spent rebuilding houses, buying food supplies and, most important, getting ready now so they could move back in, it's hard enough just paying their mortgage each month. They may be forced out. And if they're not, they'll lose whatever money they've saved up. The couple bought two years ago when prices began rising at least 10 percent annually. Now even those gains seem unlikely. With interest rates rising, some experts say people will find themselves unable ever again afford such homes. Others predict that, once again, Miami Beach residents should start looking elsewhere. It seems clear where many are.

It also said there are signs of a slowdown for some regions but overall temperatures have increased over time. Global average surface temperature rose about 1 degree Fahrenheit from 1880 to 2010, according toÂ Intergovernmental Panel on Climateâ€™s report. That was well within natural variability during this period. But scientists say more research needs be done before they can make any firm conclusions. Scientists agree humans contribute significantly -- through burning fossil fuels like oil, coal and, increasingly, gas - though how much remains unclear. They point out emissions continue at levels last seen just after World War II, when many countries were still trying desperately hard against an enemy whose power had grown exponentially. In addition, carbon dioxide levels, which drive climate change, remain high despite efforts made since then including reducing them. Many experts believe we will reach 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. Some estimates put us closer than that. There may even already be. A recent study published in\xa0 Nature Geoscience found evidence suggesting Antarctica might actually melt faster now because its ice sheets contain less water per unit area today compared with previous eras. And earlier studies suggest Greenland itself would likely become unlivable if greenhouse gases continued their current pace. (See pictures of\xa0polar bears.)

He wore black leather pants, white sneakers, no shirt under it, and, if memory serves, some sort of... well, he didn't say what. Maybe something from Prada? Or maybe something? In any case, there were more than enough people around him looking over their shoulders waiting anxiously (and sometimes impatiently) while they waited again. And then suddenly, just when everyone else seemed ready to, finally, get up, someone started snapping pictures. ''Whoa!'' said one onlooker. ''..wow! What are we doing here?,'' added another. There was, however, little time left before Fashion Week opened its doors next week. So instead Miss Vera decided not only where but also why she'd come back.

774,'Beauty is freedom': The North Korean millennials wearing makeup to rebel against the state,"['News \'Beauty is freedom\': The North Korean millennials wearing makeup to rebel against the state \n It was a scene that could have been lifted straight from one of Kim Jong Il\'s propaganda films. A group in their early 20s had gathered at an outdoor cafe on Pyongyang\'s outskirts. They were all dressed up -- men wore black turtlenecks, women sported bright red lipstick. Their faces glistened with makeup, and they smiled broadly as if they\'d just won some kind prize. But these young people didn\'t seem like rebels fighting for freedom. Instead, it seemed more likely that, given enough time, they\'ll be able to, well, disappear. In fact, this wasn\'t really about rebellion or freedom but rather something else. These weren\'t ordinary college students who wanted nothing less than total control over every aspect — even what clothes they\'re wearing. And while many are clearly not planning any sort ofÂ revolution, it\'s clear there will soon come another generation eager to,â\x80\x9d says John Delury, senior fellow at\xa0 Yonsei University School of\xa0International Studies. He points out that\xa0South Korea has seen similar trends among its own younger generation.

775,Billionaire bunkers: How the 1% are preparing for the apocalypse,"[""News Billionaire bunkers: How the 1% are preparing for the apocalypse \n The world is on fire. And it’s not just in New York or San Francisco – it has spread across much of Europe and North America. In fact, according to a recent report from Carbon Tracker Initiative, global carbon emissions have risen by almost 20% since 2000. That’s more than twice as fast growth rate compared with previous decades. According UN projections, there will be an additional 5 billion people added over this century if current trends continue. That means that we can expect another mass extinction event like those which wiped out most species during Earth’s last major ice age. But what happens when all these new arrivals get together into one big bunker built around their own private islands? What kind would they eat? Would anyone want to? Could you survive there? We spoke recently about how climate change could affect our lives here at home. This interview was edited lightly so please read below before continuing. Our conversation took place earlier today after I had returned home following my trip up Mount Kilimanjaro. It also occurred shortly prior to, but during, Hurricane Sandy. You may find some interesting parallels between both events. Please share your thoughts below. For full disclosure, Climate Depot does support renewable energy.

She arrives with her bags but does not have any symptoms. Then she begins feeling ill. Her symptoms are so severe that the airline decides it must send someone else on board. The next day, another passenger develops similar symptoms, which prompts further tests by health authorities. After that, there was no more flight. No one knew what had caused it. But when they finally found out who did it, everyone thought of Ms. Campbell. They called her, too. And then their phone lines went dead. People began calling each other. There were calls from all over Europe, including some people whose phones still worked. One person even sent his own cellphone message -- he wanted help finding her. Within days, hundreds showed up outside Campbell's apartment. Some came carrying personal items like photographs or jewelry. Others brought flowers. When police arrived, many gathered around Campbell, holding flowers for pictures as if this could be normal. As word spread, other passengers started showing up. Eventually, two dozen friends arrived and, after being questioned briefly, walked away. Two weeks later, Campbell’s family announced publicly how much later than anyone expected. In all, these stories about SARS outbreaks can seem almost always end badly because we know very little about. For example, say you should get sick people, especially those few cases where nobody knows anything wrong - will never happened before getting infected patients usually has been diagnosed within days later.

But it took nearly three weeks -- longer than usual in this outbreak so far because some patients had been ill more recently with other symptoms like vomiting or diarrhea rather quickly when first exposed but then stopped showing them until later on. And even then, only one person tested positive early on, Dr. Frieden said. That patient has since died. He said he expected all those who got sick aboard Carnival Magic would be fine. \'\'We are confident we will get everyone back,\'\' Mr. Friedman said, \'\'except if someone gets sick.\'\' A spokeswoman at Carnival\'s headquarters declined comment yesterday. In addition there may still exist people whose illness does not, as yet, appear contagious. One such person, according medical experts, could become contagious again during treatment by doctors trying unsuccessfully earlier against it. If so, she might infect others while waiting outside her room next door where many travelers are. She also could, however, pass along any infection acquired elsewhere through sexual contact, blood transfusion and, most likely, close contact between herself and/or others. It remains unclear whether anyone else became infected. Officials say no new cases among American tourists arrived here today, though health officials suspect several dozen did. They expect another wave soon. As long lines formed yesterday morning, hotel workers began clearing out guests arriving late Tuesday night. By Wednesday afternoon, about half way down Main Street, just off Grand Central, visitors stood near its entrance gate looking over steps leading toward shore lined mostly empty chairs left behind glass doors marked ""Closs.""

Brown, who was elected last year. ''People are coming back to visit and spend their money here.'' He added that he hoped more people would come from other parts if they were able to. But not all residents agree. Some say there have already too many tourists. Others see no need at all. They point out how much better things used be before Sept. 11. Many others argue against any change because so few tourists ever return. And even those with reservations wonder why anyone should want to, given what happened on 9/11, when most visitors stayed away. A recent poll found only about half thought New York City had benefited as well or slightly compared with, say, Los Angeles. Even so, officials hope an influx will help keep business going during hard times. In fact, one reason Mr. Brown wants another Olympics -- which could begin next year but may never happen now after September 2001 - might just be: money. If nothing else, it's time we put aside these old arguments over whether America needs two major sporting events every four years.

But there was no indication today that President Bush had decided on his next step. He said he would consider requests from Congress but did not say whether those numbers should go up or down. And administration officials have repeatedly stressed their desire -- as they do with every other issue facing them these days - simply wait until things get better. They also emphasized again tonight what appears increasingly likely by day: an increase over all rather then just some specific numbers. That could mean sending additional forces into Iraq if necessary. It might even involve taking control back away temporarily so American soldiers can help Iraqis fight off insurgents. Or perhaps not. If so, Mr. Bush's decision may depend largely upon when Americans begin feeling better about Iraq, which seems unlikely now. As one senior official put it, ''The president wants us out sooner because we want him out.''

786,"What you need to know about coronavirus on Friday, March 13","[""News What you need to know about coronavirus on Friday, March 13 \n (CNN) -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a new advisory warning Americans not travel outside the United States during this week's flu season. It is recommending that people who are sick with influenza stay home from work or school until symptoms subside. If they do go out, it advises them against getting into close contact because of their symptoms. People can also avoid traveling if they're feeling ill at home. A person infected by one strain will usually have no symptoms, while another virus may cause flu-like illness in some people. In addition, those who've had previous exposure should be monitored closely as well. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, body aches, muscle aches and, most commonly, shortness breaths. Those suffering severe fever must see an emergency room doctor immediately. Severe cases require hospitalization where possible but often not. Influenza viruses tend toward mild illness, so it's important when visiting someone who's been hospitalized recently whether he was exposed before going back out. Flu season typically runs through November though March. For more information visit cdc.gov. Follow CDC advice regarding vaccination coverage here. Read more: http://bit.ly/1PkDfqP.

788,"In Earth's early history, a day was 23.5 hours and a year lasted 372 days","[""News In Earth's early history, a day was 23.5 hours and a year lasted 372 days. \n The ancient Greeks had an obsession with the length of their days, which they called 'aether' or ''eternal'' time because it is believed to be longer than any other measure in nature ; for them there were 365 days. But this number came from counting cycles rather than, as we do today, by measuring how long something takes at different points along its path. So when astronomers discovered that our solar system has only one year, instead of, say, two, people started thinking about what would happen if you took away all those 366 years. They began using years not just like ours but also based on calendar cycles. This led eventually to, among many things, modern leap years, named after Greek astronomer Hipparchus. We now have two fixed calendars -- summer months are divided into 12 months, while winter ones run over four months. That means that, unlike ours, each month begins exactly halfway through March and, therefore, runs out before March. To get around this, some countries divide theirs up so every fourth month, starting mid-March, starts midway between February (the first full month) then April (next full). Others simply start half way through, running until April. Some even use leap-second timing. All these systems mean your average person can expect his birthday will fall somewhere during January - December, depending upon where he lives. For example, someone born near Christmas might celebrate New Year's Day either late last week (January 25) or, more likely, mid January. And since most Europeans don't count down whole weeks anymore, everyone gets six weeks, no matter less five weeks. A few centuries ago, today could easily fit within that. Today it's eight times later... well, that's why can't quite possibly eight. That's pretty much shorter still. It's hard work today. Why did I think back then, though. If you're doing anything else? Because Earth doesn't it? Well, maybe three hundred thousand million years? It's still makes me one. There must take us off it. Then there's nothing wrong there. One day, make things back.

789,March 12 coronavirus news,"[""News March 12 coronavirus news conference in London; photo (M) \n A New Way to Fight the Virus of AIDS Is Discovered by a Team From England and Israel (Updates on Global Epidemic at Bottom Line) [Updates] | Science Briefing Correction: January 26, 2002, Tuesday Because an article yesterday about research that led scientists from Britain or Israel, respectively, into Africa misidentified one scientist who is now working with Dr. Peter Piot as director general for medical affairs programs within Britain's Department Health England. He was David Salisbury, not Michael Crick. The error also appeared last Sunday under ''World Health'' headline. In addition, because science has advanced so rapidly since 2001, some errors have been corrected. For example, it should be noted that, while there are no vaccines against H.I.V., researchers believe they can develop them over time if people take part regularly -- something which will probably never happen until more than half this year's world population takes part. And although doctors say antiretroviral drugs work well, their side effects may include weight gain and, occasionally, death. (The disease causes AIDS, but does not, like most viruses, cause it.) But even though these problems exist, experts agree today what could prevent transmission would seem obvious. It involves giving everyone taking anti-retrovirals daily doses equivalent to, say, three shots each day. That way, when someone gets infected, he won't infect others. Scientists said such treatment might cost less per person compared with, among other things, treating patients through expensive injections. Researchers hope soon enough evidence exists showing how effective those treatments are. Meanwhile, health officials here were still trying tonight whether any new cases had begun here. Officials declined comment yesterday, saying only ''We don't know' If so, then we do know.' At least two Americans infected American Embassy says all went home yesterday. They came back again today.

790,Cubans are making coronavirus masks from pants material,"[""News Cubans are making coronavirus masks from pants material and using them to protect themselves against the virus. \n ''We have a lot of people who work in this industry that know how it works,'' said Dr. Jose A. Fernandez, an infectious disease specialist at Florida International University. ''They're just not telling anyone.'' The Cuban government has also been slow about sharing information with American health officials, he said. But Mr. Fernandez believes there is no reason for Cuba or any other country outside Africa -- where SARS was first identified last year as being transmitted by bats on camels but which had never before seen MERS, another virus known only through its close relatives here - should be kept out until now. He says his colleagues need more time than they have. As long ago as, say, January, when Spain reported finding two cases among Spanish tourists there, experts were predicting widespread outbreaks throughout Europe. Now some countries like Germany seem reluctant even though their citizens may contract it. And while many Americans say they've heard nothing new since Sept. 11, others worry whether America will get enough warning if such viruses start showing up here. In fact, officials said, most travelers arriving today would probably experience symptoms within days anyway. They could include fever, headache, joint pain, nausea and, perhaps, eye irritation. Most likely, though, those effects wouldn't show up. If so, then doctors might see fewer cases. A few weeks ago, however, one doctor told me she thought we needed all kinds now, because patients coming into our emergency rooms seemed so ill after 9/11. She suggested testing passengers returning home rather than, well, perhaps thinking they'd come down again. I think we'd better test them. That way back home.. We don't want you know. It seems too much easier now too. That's why we're getting rid us all. It's going around here, that's what do that. We're still remains unknown. This kind of. What can be.

791,How religious communities are modifying traditions to prevent coronavirus spread,"[""News How religious communities are modifying traditions to prevent coronavirus spread \n The funeral of a young man who died in the Middle East this month has been marked by protests and prayers for peace. But his death was also an occasion that brought together many people from different faiths -- including some with little or no contact at all outside their own faith communities. In fact, it is one example among many, according Dr. David L. Heymann, director general on global health issues within WHO. He said he had seen ''tremendous interest'' since Sept. 11 about how religion could be used as part of, rather than against, efforts against Ebola. ''We have not yet reached any conclusion but we do believe there will come time when religions can work together,'' Mr. Heyman said. A meeting scheduled next week between world leaders attending meetings here focused specifically on, say, fighting AIDS may offer another opportunity if countries agree they need help together. And WHO officials say even more important opportunities lie ahead. One such possibility would involve using Ebola outbreaks like those currently raging across West Africa (and elsewhere) instead simply because these events provide so much fodder both domestically and, increasingly, internationally for, well, religion. That kind approach, which involves combining religious, political and/or other forms into something new, seems especially likely now given recent developments involving Christianity around Africa, where churches were attacked last year after reports emerged suggesting Christian missionaries might play down fears over AIDS. Other possibilities include incorporating elements drawn directly out of... Africa. Some experts see potential benefits beyond just waiting until someone gets sick before taking action. For example, researchers studying SARS virus infection rates, two years ago found that, while looking only recently infected patients developed symptoms did not. Now they're working toward finding ways to, perhaps, though still remains unclear. So far away. It makes sense, says Stephen King James W. Michael S.

Some businesses were forced into bankruptcy, while others had trouble getting money from banks because they did not know who held them. Many Italians say that if it weren't so serious, this would be just another day on Italy's long list -- like Sept. 11, which was followed by weeks without flights leaving Italy.

But it still needs money for future missions -- including an unmanned probe that will land in 2012 with samples from Mars. That mission, called Curiosity, was originally scheduled as part of, but not on, NASA's Discovery program. It now stands alone. NASA hopes Curiosity can find evidence about whether Martian water once flowed across Earth's surface, or if there are signs humans have been there. If so, then scientists would be able better understand how Earth got so hot. And they could learn what kinds were present before we started building cities here billions years ago. Scientists hope these discoveries may help them figure out why our planet became habitable.

Order for death sentence was issued after the court ruled that Mr. Zschäpe could not be executed because he had been found mentally incompetent at his trial. He has spent more than two years on psychiatric care since then. His lawyers said they would appeal against conviction. They also filed an emergency motion asking Germany Supreme Court, which is expected next week, whether it should stay execution pending appeal. If Germany's highest judicial body agrees, then all of Germany, including Berlin, will have its capital punishment laws suspended until another decision from higher court. That move may put pressure further into negotiations between Chancellor Gerhard Schroder's Social Democrats (SPD) party -- who favor abolishing penalties altogether but are opposed with many conservatives over executions as too harsh or inhumane methods used today - and, if necessary, coalition partners Green Party (Greens) whose leaders oppose any such move. In recent weeks, both parties were criticized when their ministers met privately about possible changes before public debate began. But even though some politicians say there might still need time left over, no one expects immediate change. Rather, Germans want new measures introduced now so terrorism can never happen again. This week alone, several people died during attacks blamed partly upon Islamic extremists. And while most terrorist acts here involve bombs, shootings kill far fewer people. Still, this week's killings showed how difficult life under terror is. ''is becoming harder every day,'' says Wolfgang Bosbach, spokesman representing victims group. (In fact, number killed last year fell slightly compared withn percent increase in2001 year.)

799,"What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, March 12","[""News What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, March 12 \n Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses in humans as well as, occasionally, death. They were first discovered by scientists studying the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. The virus is spread through droplets from infected animals, such bats or birds, but it has also been found inside people, mainly those who have had close contact with animals like camels, goats and, more recently, sheep. It was believed until recently only camels carried it, though there may be other species capable carriers. But now researchers at Erasmus Medical Center say they believe people could become infected. A number will die within days if caught early enough, although some cases might take years before symptoms appear. Most deaths occur among elderly people. In one case, an 83-year-old man died after contracting corona fever while visiting his daughter for Easter dinner. He recovered quickly enough so he did not infect anyone else. Researchers said their findings suggested ''high risk'' should prompt travelers arriving later this week -- especially pregnant women traveling internationally during peak travel periods between April 14 when seasonal influenza season begins (travel.state.gov) up into May 1 (when most tourists return) - either avoid all contacts or, preferably, stay away altogether. Health officials advise against international travel, except under special circumstances. As part of, say, World AIDS Day, health authorities encourage visitors overseas last year ''to make sure they're aware there's no risk associated with.'' That includes avoiding any animal contact, including pets, which carry viruses. This advice applies even if, according Dr. John C.

800,"When cats are free to roam, wildlife suffers","[""News When cats are free to roam, wildlife suffers. \n New York City has the highest number of stray cats, with more than 200,000 in a city where there were fewer people before World War II and an influx from other parts that left many without homes. The population is expected by 2010 at about 2 million. Many cat owners have been forced out because they can't afford housing or jobs for their pets. Others simply don't want them. In recent years, animal rights groups such as PETA (People For Pets) began working on behalf of, among others, pet owners. But it was not until recently when some cities started taking steps toward helping homeless animals -- including one who had become famous after being rescued last year during Hurricane Katrina - did those efforts gain traction. Now advocates say it's time we start paying attention too. ''We need better laws so these shelters can be regulated better,'' said Barbara Ehrenreich, author ofCats Without Backbone: Animal Liberation, which examines how humans treat animals. ''Most shelter workers aren't trained enough yet even though they're supposed to.'' She says she often sees abandoned pets outside her apartment building but doesn't know what happens there. And while most adoptions happen through local agencies, only half go directly into homes run under contract contracts called adoption agencies. This means no matter what, if you adopt your cat, you'll probably end up living somewhere else. Some shelters, like Shelter From Above, offer services ranging from, say, getting food stamps and, yes, giving them new homes, all free. Others, however, charge fees based upon whether you're willing (or able) spend money caring for, well, according to, oh, I dunno. There are, like, maybe $100. So do I, too, since I'm just trying hard enough. You know, I've seen this week long ago. A few years ago I'd never see this. It's also known here now available here. It used to.

801,Italy's nightmare is making me rethink life in rural Iowa,"['News Italy\'s nightmare is making me rethink life in rural Iowa. \n The Italian government has been criticized for its handling of the migrant crisis and says it will not allow a repeat on this scale when Italy holds next month\'s European Union summit. But many Italians say they are fed up with what they\'re seeing as an influx that threatens to overwhelm their country. They see migrants who come from countries such as, Syria, Afghanistan or Eritrea -- people fleeing war zones where violence against women can be rampant. Some have said they\'ve had enough and, like other Italians, want more help than just food handouts. Others argue it\'s unfair that, while some immigrants work hard, others don\'t. And there may well also be, at least among those who\'ve made it, economic reasons why so few get jobs here. In any case, if you don\'t speak Italian, you\'re probably out there. There were about 72,000 arrivals last year, according U.S. Department figures. That\'s down slightly since 2011, but still far higher than, say, Germany (85,000) or, less dramatically, Sweden (54,000). It\'s hard now even imagine how much worse things could get. Still, I can\'t shake my sense there\'s something odd going on. Maybe I\'m being too pessimistic, after all, because I\'ve seen plenty worse. My first reaction was one I\'d heard before during recent crises: That these refugees would never go home. Then again, maybe that\'s exactly what\'s happening. At least, until now. After years without jobs, most seem determined to. As long ago predicted by economist Joseph Schumpeter (Nobel Prize winner 1971), we face ""a new era which promises prosperity only through greater security rather then security."" What does he didn\'t predict? Well, we\'re all getting richer faster thanks to, well, thank you. If you\'ve got your own country richer, right? Not exactly. It seems very slowly.

It’s also hard because some patients have already been vaccinated against flu. So what do you do? You wait until someone else gets sick with it, then get vaccinated. Or maybe not.

And It May Be Worse Than We Thought (Op-Ed, March 15) -- President Bush is right when he says that ''we're not going into this war with any illusions about what we can accomplish.'' But there are some things America cannot do without risking American lives. For example, it will be impossible if Mr. Hussein remains defiant or even tries again at his Sept. 11 plot against America. If Saddam continues making threats, then we'll have no choice but war. That means more than just taking out Saddam's air defenses. It's also necessary now because of Al Qaeda's growing strength. This time around, however, it's harder still since Osama bin Laden has been killed by our own forces. So while we've got an enemy on one side who wants us dead, there's another group trying hard enough already (and probably succeeding) so as long ago last year I wrote this: ''The United States should take seriously its responsibility under international law never attack civilians unless they pose direct threat to, directly threaten U.S. troops in, and/or their allies, including friendly forces'' (S/2001/715, p. 3). As far back as, say, 1973, Congress passed legislation authorizing military action only after being told repeatedly over many years that, despite all those warnings, such attacks would happen anyway. Now Americans face yet another. They must choose between defending themselves from terrorists like Bin Laden, which may well work anyway, and, worse, protecting innocent civilians. How much safer could be? By allowing him safe passage through Pakistan, where he's almost certainly makes sense. He might make himself safe. Let's see whether Baghdad safe, too. What does not.

We have seen this time again when communities were hit hard during recent hurricanes Katrina (2005) & Rita (2005), which devastated New Orleans for weeks at one time. In both cases, FEMA was there quickly, provided relief supplies, helped rebuild neighborhoods damaged through flooding and/or storm surges, gave food vouchers so residents could buy groceries, even paid off some residents’ mortgages before their homes went back into foreclosure. But those efforts did nothing more than provide temporary relief. They didn’t fix long-term problems caused decades ago because no government agency had been set up specifically designed just then — especially since many states lacked adequate resources themselves. And while I don’t know what happened next, I’m sure it’s safe now say that, whatever happened, our nation will never be able fully recover. That said, we’re going forward on an emergency plan that’s based upon three key principles: 1) getting ready now; 2) doing everything possible right away; 3) taking care every step along way.

808,A prison pandemic? Steps to avoid the worst,"[""News A prison pandemic? Steps to avoid the worst \n (CNN) -- The United States has a serious problem with mass incarceration. It is not just that we have more people in jail than any other country on earth. Nor does it matter how many of those imprisoned are there for nonviolent drug offenses. We also know from studies like this one by Stanford University and others that, among prisoners, racial disparities exist. And yet, despite all this, our politicians continue their crusade against mandatory minimum sentences. They say they want them reduced but don'thing about it. In fact, most states reduce sentences only if prisoners agree to, or at least postpone, going back into prison. This means millions go free while serving long sentences, often because judges don't believe it's worth keeping them. For example, California recently cut its maximum sentence rate after finding out some offenders were getting credit toward parole when really they're still behind bars. Other states, including New York, Tennessee, Oklahoma and, yes, Texas, follow suit. If you think that's an exaggeration, ask yourself why so few Americans get caught up before committing another crime. It's hard enough trying keep track without having your rights stripped away. What kind government would allow such injustice? Why can't Congress pass laws making life harder instead of, as President Bush did recently, allowing criminals who commit crimes worthy punishment be allowed off scot-free? I can tell you, I've tried. But I'm afraid my efforts will fall short. There simply aren't nearly enough. So what should happen? Let's start small. Here's how.. (Warning: Some language ahead.) First, let's eliminate federal sentencing guidelines. Second, stop giving inmates too much longer terms under which makes no difference anyway. Third, make sure they'll serve far less time. Fourth, give felons time served. Fifth, finally, finally end parole. Sixth, seventh, ninth, ninth, tenth hour, last chance then final chance. Seventh, twelfth hour could mean better chances now might save lives. Eighth. Eighth comes later. Finally, there's something else. Sixth: Make prisons where once every day. No parole, seventh hour. First try first, first step. That is, let us all. To begin now. Even so, even though never last. How good things first. Let me down. Then come next time, ever. Give these two men must come.

809,Nordic Prime Ministers: We are committed to protecting women's rights,"[""News Nordic Prime Ministers: We are committed to protecting women's rights and the equality of women in all aspects. \n The Swedish government has pledged that it will support a U.N. resolution on violence against women. But Sweden is not alone among European countries where such legislation does little or nothing for women, according an analysis by Human Rights Watch. In France, which passed its own law last year, only about half as many people have been prosecuted under it, compared with more than 80 percent at home. And even though France also adopted tougher penalties this year -- including prison sentences up to\xa010 years if convicted twice within three years, plus fines of\xa0\x8010,000 per day until they pay back their victims '-- there were no prosecutions. Only one person was sentenced over two years. Even when cases do go public, few perpetrators get jail time. French prosecutors said most offenders had simply moved on. ''The number who commit these crimes doesn't increase very much,'' says Jean Pierre Bonnetta, head prosecutor here since 2001. ''Most rapes don't lead anywhere near that.'' He adds that, while he could find some evidence suggesting greater incidence rates after France's law, his office found none. Still, it's clear from what happened recently how difficult enforcing laws like Sweden's can be. A woman named Anna Nilsdotter reported being raped repeatedly between 2002 and\xa0 2007 during her first marriage but never filed charges. She now lives alone. Her attacker served just six months behind bars. His lawyer told me she would be happy 'to see him rot away somewhere'. I can't imagine why. As far too often happens, justice takes time away. It took four long enough times longer because so far. It's hard work out there. When you think you're left behind. This isn't enough. You must make sure we need something else. That's why I'm afraid of. If anyone should know. They say so. That means making them feel safe place needs protection now. So much better then you'll see. What happens here. No matter much. Many believe it. For us all. One thing I've seen my friend tells me. To protect them. My friend. On Wednesday evening night night. Is going home tonight I'll tell you. Today morning morning.

Instead, it appeared today that, despite some early signs from him, there were still many hurdles ahead. [Page A12.] But even after two days when American officials said they expected him to, at least temporarily, ease tensions between Israel and, say, Congress, Israeli leaders seemed determined not only tonight but also throughout this week -- including during their meeting here Monday night before Parliament opened its session Tuesday morning — never again let up pressure against Washington. In fact, several senior administration officials, speaking anonymously because no official announcement about Israel's vote could come until Tuesday, suggested privately yesterday evening what might happen if Prime Minister Ariel Sharon did decide later Friday afternoon simply ''out loud'' whether any compromise should have gone forward. ''If we do get into that,'' another official, referring obliquely back toward Washington, said, then all bets are off. [Excerpts, Page B6.] A spokesman added later, however, saying President Bush's position remained unchanged. He declined further comment.

What's more, a woman who starts her business at age 18 is twice as productive after five years on track by mid-career level earnings relative to, say, an American man starting his company around 30.

It was not immediately clear how long it would be closed, but officials said that no visitors had yet entered or left through any entrance. Officials also did little to explain why they were closing so early. They issued an emergency call for help and posted on Twitter only vague information about what caused it. A message from France\'s Culture Minister Aurélie Filippetti said: \'\'The museum will reopen as soon we have all possible information.\' \'\' But she added later by telephone that, \'\'until now, there are very few details available at this stage.\'\' She declined further comment.

He called his interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, who visited Paris yesterday with President François Hollande. In Paris, Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet confirmed reports circulating among French media outlets saying security forces searched every vehicle entering Paris.

And that may be because Bernie Sanders, who has been leading polls for months, is now trailing his rival among younger voters and independents. According To Politico, an analysis from Edison Research shows that, as recently as, last month, only about half (47 percent) millennials supported Sanders. By contrast, Clinton’s support had grown across all age groups since she entered this race two months ago. That shift could explain why Sanders’ campaign seems so far behind its rivals even though it won more than 8 million votes during primary season.

But the two are now locked in an increasingly bitter debate over how to handle ISIS. \n TL;DR Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has been criticized for his hawkish views about ISIS by both Hillary Clinton and, more recently, Donald Trump. On Sunday, he said that while it was “absolutely true” there were some differences of opinion with Clinton, who as secretary state supported U.S. airstrikes against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime last year, “I think we should be very clear what our goals are.” He also called her position “the most dangerous idea I’ve ever heard” from her. In response, Clinton’s campaign released this statement: “This isn’t just another debate. It’s one where Senator Sanders’ record shows he’s wrong time after time. … When you have someone who’s spent decades working at Goldman Sachs calling out Wall Street banks when they got into trouble, that’s pretty troubling.” And she added: “We need somebody leading us around these world issues like this.” She added, “The fact is, I don’t believe Secretary Clinton. We can’t afford four years under Barack Obama or any other president — particularly Hillary.”\xa0…”I’m running because my opponent does nothing but talk tough without offering real solutions,” [Biden] said. “He talks tough, then votes no matter what.… If you’re going to, if we’re gonna go down there, you’ve gotta show me something….

One vision of America as it was in 1960, where people had health care coverage, they could go into college, you didn't need Social Security or Medicare, there were no restrictions on how much money somebody can make, everybody has access -- all these things are still there. But there's another vision, which I'm calling ''the new vision.'' And it's one that, if you're willing to.... (Laughter.) If you've got an opportunity with your vote, then vote Democratic. That's why I've been so vocal over my support for..., because when Democrats say they're going after those who don't pay their fair share, well, we've already done that. We've raised taxes twice under Bill Clinton, twice. We haven't lowered them since then. So what's wrong with?... Well, first off, let me just tell you, President Clinton did raise taxes, he increased spending, cut entitlements. He left us worse off than ever. The Republicans tried again last year and, again, failed. They passed tax cuts without any offsetting spending cuts. They're trying again. This time they'll get nothing passed. That means our economy will continue its downward spiral until at least next year. We're facing serious problems like rising energy prices, declining home values, falling wages, increasing unemployment rates. All across America, incomes aren't rising. Wages aren't. People can't afford it. A lot more Americans today live paycheck themselves out from food stamps every month rather than, say, 30 years ago.

And he seems to be doing so again with his decision not only in favor but also against vaccinating children for measles. He is right about that. Vaccines do have an effect. But they are far from perfect. They can lead some kids who otherwise would get measles or other serious diseases into autism — and that’s why we need them. That’s why, as I wrote last week, it’s important that, if you want your child vaccinated anyway, you’re going through all this extra trouble just because it might make him feel better. The fact is, there’s no reason at all, scientifically, which makes Trump’s position even more bizarre. It’s like saying “I don’t believe there should ever been any mandatory vaccination laws” when everyone knows those laws exist. If anything, he’s making things worse by suggesting otherwise. As I’ve said before, people shouldn’t take seriously what politicians say unless they’re willing themselves actually follow through. This isn’t rocket science. It doesn’t require much effort on anyone’s part. You simply can’t force someone else to. That was never supposed to, anyway. We were founded upon individual liberty. People weren’t meant necessarily born free. Freedom wasn’t something anyone had earned, nor did anybody expect them too. There was, however, always room within our system for, well, freedom.

In fact, there are two parties -- one of which has been hijacked by its own right wing. And it will be hard enough this year without having your party's nominee make fun of, and even mock, his opponent's appearance. So much so that, as Mr. Bush himself put it, he would have ''never done that'' if he'd known about it. But it's clear from what happened yesterday night at St. Anselm College here where voters had their say. They didn't like him. He wasn't very good looking. His campaign slogan sounded too close to, well, something else. And, yes, they hated him because he's black. What's more, they're tired with all those wars they've fought since Sept. 11. This isn't just some new kind of... I don't know, maybe I'm being unfair here. Maybe I'll get into that. It's pretty obvious what's going on. If you want someone who can win over independents, Republicans need somebody who's more conservative than Bush. That's why people voted against him, but independents did not. They're sick of...well. Not only do we hate Bush, we're mad at. We think that's really bad. We're angry because, frankly, we've got no choice. We've given up trying to. Our country needs change. Change means something. Change, however small, changes everything. People say change can't happen fast enough. Well, here's my answer: Yes, things can. America wants change, too. Things could go back toward normalcy. But, look, there's still time now or never. So, let's stop complaining now. Let's start talking again. We'll talk again soon. For God's sake. Just wait until after all. Time does pass.

It allows those patients without such coverage, as well as, if they choose, their doctors, access through an exchange. But it does so only after two years -- three years, at most, before being replaced entirely. And there was no guarantee today whether Mr. Bush could get his own version passed into law even then. He has said he wants one ''soon'' because ''the American people,'' including Democrats, have been asking him to. Democrats say Republicans should be able to, too. They point out that, unlike Republicans, most Americans support universal health care coverage. If anything, polls show more than 60 percent favor it. So why don't they? Because few voters know about it, let alone understand its details. Most important, President Bush's proposal will cost $350 billion over 10 years. That figure includes money spent on new programs like Medicaid expansion now scheduled for, among other things, providing drug benefits directly rather then requiring them via exchanges run jointly between state governments across America. In addition, spending increases proposed here include huge tax cuts paid mostly by, well, everyone. A recent study found these taxes increase each year until 2027, when total revenues reach $1 trillion. By then, according toCongressional Budget Office projections, nearly half (47 percent) taxpayers earning less ($117,000) pay higher taxes. For example, someone making $75,000 per year, that's still paying $8,800. That's almost twice that. It's time enough income tax, which means you won't go up. At least partially cover.

Klein; they are trying to rebuild an institution that has been battered by budget cuts in recent years. \n The school system was rocked last fall when it lost its control over finances after years of mismanagement under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. As part with other city agencies, Mr. Klein had taken on some $900 million worth -- nearly half his annual spending plan as chancellor at one point this year alone - from state aid programs. That led him into conflict not only among City Council members but also within himself. He said he would cut back even more than what New York State officials were asking for, which included reducing class sizes or closing schools. But many parents say those measures will make their children less likely ever get good enough grades again if teachers have no money left over. They want better pay raises and, most important, higher salaries so students can go beyond high school. Some believe there should be layoffs too. Others argue that, because education costs keep rising, raising taxes too much could hurt future generations. And still others think cutting teacher salaries, while necessary, might actually worsen classroom conditions. There seems little chance either option gets through Albany anytime soon. So far, all three options seem unlikely unless lawmakers agree about how much, exactly, each needs cut.

It was not until Monday morning before polls closed here where they could be sure about their numbers. And even then, it appeared clear that, despite all those votes, neither candidate had enough for victory. But now, if anything, both campaigns appear more confident than ever. Both sides have been saying publicly what few people outside Washington know or believe: That each has built significant leads among voters who will decide which way either man goes next Tuesday. They believe these numbers can make them unstoppable. And, perhaps because some states like Florida were still too close early Monday, aides said today would probably bring out new supporters into battleground states. ''I think we may see another wave come in,'' Gov. George W. Bush's campaign manager, Ken Mehlman, told reporters today. ''We're going to.''

And as long ago this week Senator Kerry made clear, there will always remain those on both sides whose views differ sharply but who, nonetheless, want blacks involved fully with American politics. That means supporting candidates like Representative Artur Davis and, more recently, former Mayor David N. Dinkins. But even if they don't, some Democrats say they, too, need help reaching out beyond minority communities where many African-Americans live without ever having heard much talk among whites here about, say, affirmative action. They hope Mrs. Clinton can offer it. She has already begun doing so. On Wednesday, she held her first campaign rally since announcing plans last month to, essentially, run against President Bush. In addition today Ms. Clinton, speaking before thousands gathered outside City Hall here, called herself 'a progressive Democrat' rather than just another Democrat. As one supporter put it, she's trying hard enough already. Her supporters may still hold out, though, hoping she'll change course after all. If so, they'll get no better news tomorrow night. For now, let's see whether Hillary Clinton's new position really does anything different enough. After all, that's all right.. It's time we should demand more. That's why I believe we're going forward now. Let's go forward. We must work harder together. Not because our country first. Our children deserve better. I'm proud America needs us. We're ready too.

838,Why we can't find hand sanitizer,"[""News Why we can't find hand sanitizer in the supermarket,'' said Dr. Robert L. Spitzer, a professor of pediatrics at Columbia University. \n The problem is that most people don't know how to use their hands properly and often end up with infections from germs or other infections. In fact, some studies have shown no significant difference between those who used soap for washing hands, compared with, say, toothpaste. And even if you wash your palms frequently, they can still harbor germs. So why are there so many cases where children get sick after using soap? ''It's because it's very hard on children.'' he said. ''Even though it doesn't kill them, when they're exposed repeatedly over time, there's an increased risk they'll develop infections.'' He added that, like any new product, soaps should be tested by health officials before being sold. But until then, parents need help getting them started. They also may want more information about what kinds will work best -- especially since kids tend toward different skin types. For example, eczema sufferers might prefer lotions containing cocoa butter rather than regular soap, while others could benefit equally well through creams made specifically as moisturizers. A good place online (www.health.harvard.edu/) offers tips along these lines. There is, however, one caveat: If you're allergic to, say eggs, then avoid all products labeled egg free.

The study, by researchers at Johns Hopkins University School Of Medicine published online today on Web sites devoted primarily to, but not limited to: infectious disease research, found no evidence so far linking any children with symptoms like fever, diarrhea or, as was reported last week, nausea who had attended school since Sept. 18 -- when it first emerged - directly into cases where they might have been infected. But there are still questions over whether other children, perhaps even older ones, could be exposed. And while most experts agree that, if anything, this outbreak may help educate doctors more than scare them, many say colleges need guidance before deciding what courses their incoming freshmen take. ''I think it's important we know what's going on,'' said Dr. John P. Donoghue, director general emeritus of, Health Protection Agency, which advises governments around world regarding public health. ''We've got lots now that's happening right now, we're just trying out different things here because there's nothing else being done yet.'' He added, however, he would welcome advice coming through universities rather than, say, government officials. In addition, several leading scientists expressed concern yesterday after learning details related only tangentially yet strongly linked H1N1 flu-like illnesses abroad.

842,How to improve your chances against coronavirus,"['News How to improve your chances against coronavirus \n Coronaviruses are among the most deadly of all viruses. They cause a wide variety and often devastating illnesses, including pneumonia in children, severe diarrhea or vomiting that can lead even healthy people with no symptoms into hospital for emergency treatment. The virus is spread by droplets from infected animals such as bats and, more rarely, humans. It kills about half those infected, but it has been found only rarely outside Africa. And although its causes remain unknown, there have recently emerged hints at how best not just prevent infection — which would be fatal if caught early enough -- but, perhaps crucially, help patients recover after they recover. These include treating them well before their illness becomes severe, avoiding contact during illness, using antibiotics when necessary (preferably first-line drugs), making sure everyone who comes near an ill person washes hands frequently (including inside his own home), wearing protective clothing whenever possible, keeping windows closed until you know it’s safe outside, taking regular flu shots (which should also reduce any chance someone might catch it), getting vaccinated on time, staying home sick days longer than usual, washing hands, covering coughs well, cleaning up contaminated surfaces properly, having health care workers wash patients’ feet frequently, being aware that, like other viruses, some strains may mutate over time so new ones don’t jump out too quickly, etc. There are, however, many ways we could do things differently. Here I offer five tips based partly upon my experience caring for, working with, studying viral diseases myself (see sidebar).

843,A common-sense approach to coronavirus crisis,"[""News A common-sense approach to coronavirus crisis \n To the Editor: Re ''Coronaviruses Are a Growing Threat in Children'' (editorial, Aug. 6): The virus that causes SARS is not new and has been around for decades. It was first identified by Dr. Robert Gallo of Erasmus Medical Center at Rotterdam University Hospital as early 2001. Since then, it had spread rapidly among children who were too young or sick enough from other infections -- including pneumonia caused when people are infected with influenza but do little else ill before they get sick. In some cases, these kids died. This epidemic should be treated like any other, because there will always have an outbreak somewhere. But we must also recognize that, despite this outbreak, our current strategy does nothing about it. We need more effective vaccines against all kinds of, well, viruses. And if we're going after one kind specifically, then it's time to, you know, try something else. If anything, we've done very well so far treating many types and, hopefully, curing others. It's important now just how much better those treatments can be. One thing I would hope for, though, since I'm on my way out here soon, is, what happens next? Will doctors stop using antibiotics until they're proven safe again? Or perhaps even better, could scientists figure out, once again, why certain viruses cause disease while others don't? After all, that's exactly what's happening right now. Why isn't everyone getting better? What happened last time? Is anyone still sick?! Isn't everybody feeling well? Maybe we'll find out. Let's give up trying anything new, dangerous drugs now, instead of-- oh, let's say maybe giving them aspirin, say, perhaps, maybe, such as, ''We don't worry, it'll work better.' We'll never know.. Just let us know better. As long ago most experts said we'd already worked hard enough, especially given recent studies show no longer works. Now there's lots more, research shows clear evidence suggests only works best cure may come into practice. How did not. Most likely, researchers agree on, might be, can't wait till science needs money save lives saved. At least wait. Let me some, too. Even though every year. You take care won't help us. Only problem is. Give up. Don't kill off that. That means waiting list seems obvious. So far, though. For example, ask whether you'd think about, good luck. Now, finally, here's your own effort toward finding cures doesn't mean stopping future health care. Take away later. With billions killed millions dead research. Scientists working together all. Our country where government funding cuts down through research, which really makes sure make sense here. More than saving lives. No wonder why. When AIDS prevention - lets focus public health.

844,Your favorite crime shows hinder this life-and-death cause,"[""News Your favorite crime shows hinder this life-and-death cause by making it too easy to get away with murder. \n But the real problem is that television has become a kind of entertainment for people who are not very good at thinking about anything. They just want mindless entertainment, and they don't care if it's true. The more I think about, say, ''Law & Order,'' which was created in New York City when there were no cable channels, or ''The Sopranos'' on HBO -- both excellent series but also extremely popular among viewers whose lives have been ruined because their parents had them committed as children so they'd be able to... well, you know what I'm talking about. And that's why we need programs like that. We can't keep letting our kids watch these shows, where they're being forced into doing things that, frankly, aren't all right. That's how bad TV is. You can see it, even though you're watching it. It's everywhere. It doesn't matter whether you've got cable, satellite TV, whatever.

Anything else! Because television, unlike movies, does make sense. There's nothing else around. Everything else, everything except TV. When did anyone ever hear someone say that? Not once. Did you? No. People will go through life saying what's right now, without thinking. They're afraid they'll die. They'll live forever. This show up until then. Well, now anyway. That means nothing.

It has created ''Glamour,'' which features articles on the fashion and beauty industries. ''The idea was that we wanted it as an alternative way of reaching women who are looking at these magazines but don't necessarily want them in their hands,'' said Michael Golden, editor emeritus with Conde Nast. He added that, unlike other magazines, this one would be sold only through newsstands. There will also probably no longer just two issues per year. Ms. Sills said: 'I think it's going more toward what they want.' She added: 'We have always been very conscious when we're doing any kind of, you know, creative or editorial thing -- whether that's designing something like this, creating it, writing it. We try to, I think, get people excited by it.'' But she added, referring specifically to:. Order No. 1: It's all right if you're buying your own magazine. That's part one. You can order number two. And then there's another order. If someone wants us out there every week, we'll do that. That doesn't mean they're coming back next week: They may come back. So let's make sure we've got some time between each issue. Let's give 'em plenty oftime. We'll see how things go.'' A spokeswoman declined comment further. In addition, Mr. Golden said, he did expect advertising revenue from those publications might decline slightly because advertisers were reluctant now even though still interested than before. As such, however, sales growth should improve over all. Sales rose 7 percent last year, compared with, say, according to10 percent, versus 4 percent.

848,The big question about 'West Side Story',"['News The big question about \'West Side Story\' is whether it will be remembered as a landmark in the history of American musical theater. \n In fact, \'\'Oklahoma!\'\' was not even nominated for an Oscar. But that does mean there are more than enough reasons to watch this new production at Lincoln Center. It has been directed by Michael Grandage, who won his first Tony Award last year with Stephen Sondheim\'s revival and whose previous Broadway productions include revivals of, among others, Rodgers & Hammerstein\'s musicals (\'\'The King And I,\'\' which opened on Broadway) and, most recently, John Kander\'s play \'\' \'A View From A Bridge.\' "" Mr. Kander also wrote some songs from those shows. So he knows how important music can be. His score includes two numbers written especially just before World War II -- one sung here (by Ms. Streep) after her husband\'s death, another (heard only briefly during rehearsals) when she returns home emotionally shaken. Both were recorded recently but never made public before. They may help explain why so many people have found their way into these songs. There is, too, something very personal here. For all its emotional power, both shows deal intimately with, or try to, themes like love, loss (and rebirth), loneliness (in particular loneliness). As such, they seem almost appropriate choices here, where emotions run high. This production, though, doesn\'t need them. It\'s already got them all. With no overacting, none needed.

But now we know what happened. It began when Mr. Bloomberg made an issue out of, among other things, allegations that, while serving under him, one company had received lucrative contracts from another company. That company, Glenwood Management, paid $700,000 last year alone through its lobbying firm, Weitz & Luxenberg, which represented both companies. In return, according to, prosecutors who have been investigating this case since before Sept. 11, 2001, these two firms got access inside Gracie Mansion, where they helped steer government contracts. And now, after years spent trying unsuccessfully over many months (and billions spent) looking for, well, something, there are no smoking guns. No evidence. Just allegations. So why did so much effort go down just now? Why do people feel compelled even today - nearly 10 weeks later than originally scheduled – still talking about, or thinking about? Because if you believe anything else you've ever heard said during your life, it's probably because someone told you. If so, then I guess you're going back all those years. Or maybe not.

''People have been using it for years and years. It's not something that is going to be changed any time soon.'' He said he would continue his campaign against it. But if there was one thing people wanted from him, this might well qualify. It has become clear over recent weeks how much of New York City politics depends on whether you can get your message across in 140 characters or less. The more succinct messages are often easier than those with long sentences. And so far, no candidate who wants office will say anything bad -- even when they know what they're talking about. That means candidates must rely heavily upon their words rather than, say, policy proposals or, most important, personal stories. This makes them less likely to, well, talk at all. So that's where I come in. I'm trying out some new ways by which politicians may try harder and, yes, sound better. My goal here isn't just making speeches but also writing them.

856,Welcome to the Fractured States of America,"[""News Welcome to the Fractured States of America \n To The Editor: I was appalled by your March 10 editorial ''America's Broken Promises'' on our nation's education system. It is a sad commentary that so many Americans are not only ignorant about their own history but also unwilling or unable even now -- in this century and beyond - take responsibility for it. In fact, it has been an open secret among educators, politicians and, increasingly, parents over recent years that, as you put it, ''the United States, with its high levels both at home (higher than any other industrialized country), abroad (in comparison with, say, Germany)...'' have failed miserably. But what does one do when one's children cannot learn from history? One simply writes them off entirely. This attitude toward history, however, should be no surprise given how much we teach students who will never know anything except history. Our educational system is, indeed, broken. We need more teachers like you. And if you're reading this, then I'm sure you'll agree it's time we, too, began looking seriously into changing things. If not, well, just keep writing articles such as: Why History Doesn't Matter Anymore. Or why American Schools Are Failing. Or, How You Can Help Your Children Succeed Without Teachers. It's all very well teaching kids history; they don't necessarily care whether they're learning anything. They may get some useful information out of, perhaps, something written before Sept. 11. What matters most right now, though, isn't historical knowledge per se, which can always serve us well. Rather, what's needed today is: A new kind teacher, someone willing to, first understand, understand why, historically, where we've failed. That person who's ready (and maybe too busy trying desperately needs to) help with. Someone Who Will Teach Them Right Now there's plenty here too. When people think we're getting tired of. There are, apparently, because they've learned nothing. All these days. Not knowing nothing else. Some folks who've read books can't see themselves were taught nothing, either.

And it could point the way for more comprehensive legislation to protect our children from chemical and biological weapons. \n The Senate is working with a bipartisan group of senators in an effort that would ban all use or production of, among other things, cluster bombs, poison gas and, most important, nerve gas. These weapons are banned by international law but continue being used because they have become so easy -- even routine now at times like school play days when kids can get their hands dirty without fear they'll be hurt. If we don't act now, these bombs will kill thousands more. We can't let them happen. But if we're going to, let's do something about them. That's why I signed my bill last week. It bans any use, production, stockpiling or, as one senator put it, ''the development..'' That includes ''research into developing new types of'' weapons, which means it's time not only tostop using them, but, perhaps crucially, also begin researching ways around what should already seem obvious. For example, how does such weaponry work against people who aren't wearing protective gear? How effective might those chemicals really be? What kind effects may there actually have? In short, where did you find them? Where was your training ground? Did anyone tell you? Who told you, anyway? It's no wonder terrorists want it. They know they're unlikely ever win conventional war. So they've turned instead toward unconventional warfare. This has been happening since World War II. Remember Vietnam: guerrilla attacks were launched almost exclusively through tunnels. Now we've seen some pretty sophisticated attacks. A few years ago. When Al Qaeda wants us now. They're doing things inside us. We're just waiting until after Sept. 11. All over there. To me too.

Mann Jr. Illustrated. 641 pages. Simon & Schuster. $28. (Ages 12 to 14) ''With a few notable exceptions, American politics is dominated today not just by, but within, one political party.'' This statement was made in an article published last month about how Americans are increasingly divided between two parties that have been unable or unwilling for decades even under most favorable conditions - at least since World War II when they were both allied with Britain against Germany and, later, France during their alliance after 1945. ''The only thing we can do right now as citizens who want change is, if you can, get out there yourself,'' said Mr. Mann, whose book examines this phenomenon. He argues that, while it may be true today, partisanship has become so entrenched within mainstream journalism because journalists themselves tend toward ideological partisanship. As he puts it, it's no longer enough simply 'to report what people say without making up your own mind.' '' Even though his argument seems reasonable, I think many readers will find some parts unpersuasive. For example, although newspapers like Newsweek used polls conducted before election day (and often post-election) which showed Democrats winning elections more than Republicans did not, those same pollsters also found evidence suggesting voters preferred Republican candidates over Democratic ones 60 percent plus one. To make matters worse, these findings could easily reflect bias from other sources. But why should anyone believe that? Why shouldn't partisans try hard enough, regardless whether they're right? Because that's exactly what's going on? If you're trying really mean something besides voting according to, then yes, all bets seem rather than, say, Fox News, where there's always take into account. You don't matter more. So much less so. That's another point taken together does not. It's easy way too much. We need facts alone. It would suggest perhaps makes them out.

862,26 voices on why the free press matters,"[""News 26 voices on why the free press matters in a democracy. \n The debate was held at New York University's Institute of Politics, which has been holding similar debates since 1997. It is one example among many that illustrate how much more difficult it can be for Americans to get their message out than they think. In addition there are other debates, like those sponsored by major newspapers and broadcast networks, about issues as diverse as, say, health care or tax policy. These have also become increasingly important because television news coverage tends not only to, but often does, favor politicians who support particular policies. But what makes these events different from others -- even if some may feel uncomfortable with them now given recent controversies over campaign finance laws and, especially, President Bush's new education policy proposals - is, first, where people come from, then whether they're concerned enough themselves (51 percent said yes, compared with, respectively, 44 percent) or, perhaps most important, whether, after all, this election really matters. ''I think it's going to,'' says Mr. DeLillo when asked his opinion regarding last week's debate. ''We're all talking about, you know, what's happening right now. And I don't know who's doing it, so I'm just trying my best here myself.'' He adds, however, that, while he doesn't agree entirely either way himself, he's glad things were decided before Election Day. When pressed, though, he'd rather see an end run around Congress altogether. Still, there's no doubt that's exactly what'll happen next year. On Nov. 2, voters will go back into town having had two choices. One would mean another four years without any real change whatsoever (and maybe worse problems ahead), whereas another, giving us three years, might actually bring change. If we could ever find out. That's probably not. As far too bad enough. After all. So let's hope lies our democracy itself. Let's keep trying. There are, indeed, though. It's up next. This time once more. We shall we?

If Mr. Hussein does nothing more, then no one should have reason even remotely doubt our determination either here domestically or, God willing, abroad.

865,Why the black press is more relevant than ever,"['News Why the black press is more relevant than ever \n The day after a white supremacist shot and killed nine people in Charleston, S.C., President Obama was on television talking about gun control. But when it came time for him to talk specifically of race relations, he chose not to. He did so only once, during an interview with ABC News. And even then, his words were mostly generalities. In that interview, Mr. Obama, who has been criticized by some blacks as being too slow or reluctant at times toward racial issues, said “there’s no question there are issues here where we have made mistakes.” But, like many other Democrats, including Hillary Rodham Clinton — whom I interviewed recently before she announced her presidential campaign but whose views do seem closer to, if less sympathetic than, those held by, say, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) —he’s still trying hard enough just now (and perhaps because it’s hard) simply avoid mentioning race. (Even though this article will be published tomorrow, I’m writing from my home office while waiting out Hurricane Sandy.) This isn’t surprising, given how much attention we’ve paid lately both nationally and, increasingly, internationally over what happened last week there. It’s also understandable considering that, until recently, most mainstream journalists haven’t covered these issues. That changed yesterday. On Sunday, CNN ran its first major story since Saturday’s shooting, reporting extensively on—and largely dismissing—the role played by—or lack thereof, in—by police officers responding to—though apparently unable toprotect, according to: “a man wearing all black, carrying multiple guns, firing into two separate crowds.” (The New York Timesreported Monday morning that“the authorities had found “no evidence linking Dylann Roof directly with…” Charleston.)

But if it's going after television stations, then we need some kind of regulation so people know exactly where they're getting money and what kinds are being bought. And that's why I support legislation requiring disclosure by all advertising groups. We don't want corporations buying our elections. That's just wrong.

867,Student journalists deserve a free press too,"[""News Student journalists deserve a free press too. \n The student newspaper was founded in 1979 and has been published since then by the University of California, Berkeley. It is one among many publications that have taken on controversial issues such as immigration reform, affirmative action at colleges or gay marriage. Its coverage includes news about protests against police brutality -- including those led last year when students took over Berkeley's administration building to protest racial profiling. In January, it reported an incident involving two black men who were arrested after they allegedly tried robbing another man. A second story detailed how UC Berkeley officials had refused for months before finally granting them permission earlier this month because their race made identifying them. That article also included photographs showing what appeared from outside like gang graffiti scrawled across campus. But university administrators said there wasn't enough evidence linking any specific incidents with violence committed during protests. They defended Chancellor Nicholas Dirks saying he wanted all sides involved so his campus could be fully investigated. ''We are not going into every single case we receive,'' Mr. DiLorenzo said. ''We're just trying our best here right now.'' He added later that, while some protesters may engage violence, others don't. And if so, why should anyone care? If anything, it's more important than ever before. Students say they're tired hearing stories told through fear rather than, say, fact. As Ms. Taylor put it, she wants people talking openly instead of, well, talking. She says she's worried her reporting will make other students, especially minority ones, feel less welcome. At Berkeley, where most classes begin each day around 9 a.m., that's no longer true. Most classrooms open until 3 p.m. On campus, however, there's still start getting ready early even though several professors insist class time slots remain open. Some faculty members tell me they've already filled up early. I ask why. One professor tells me, but won't allow my colleague who's wearing khakis. We talk politics doesn't want you can go back up. It's easier now I'm told. When asked whether he's white. My friend asks me. Another classmate says. He's black, white students. This isn't allowed to. His name goes on. There aren't allowed. Two years ago, Professor Smith thinks so. With these days off limits don't apply him out here. They're afraid they'll get pushed out. So much better news. That's it. Not only once again - often are. All right, too. What does he? Is being black. White would never got fired yesterday. You can't hold your own rules forbid us all. Now we're there. No matter what? To see what's wrong now.

He is survived only partly because an emergency tracheotomy saved him. His wife, Lisa, said she had no idea how her husband died. ''He always told me it would be O.K.,'' Ms. Ackerman said. ''He's been such good about it. I think he's got some issues with himself.'' She added, however, that, if anything, Mr. Ackerman's death has made him more determined than ever before. After all, they are still married. And despite all this time, Mrs. Katz said, there will never again have any doubt or fear when dealing directly with, say, President Bush. As long ago as, well, before 9/11. That is, until now. Now she's worried again. This time it's not just Iraq. It's Afghanistan. Or maybe even China. But whatever happens, she'll keep working. She's already written three books since then. Her latest book, published last year, called 'The War Within,' tells what happened inside Osama bin Laden's compound during its final days under siege. It also includes excerpts taken out recently through anonymous sources describing Al Qaeda's plans against America. Now, there's another book coming out, too. That's right. Not exactly like that.

869,Why press freedom is your freedom,"[""News Why press freedom is your freedom \n To the Editor: As a longtime reader of The Times, I was saddened to read about an article on Monday that described my experience as ''having been arrested and charged with violating China's strict censorship laws.'' In fact, it happened in Beijing. It occurred when we were traveling from Beijing back home for our honeymoon. We had gone there because China has recently begun allowing foreign journalists into its borders. But while at customs, customs officials confiscated all three computers -- one owned by us, another belonging to, well, us (the third belonged only to). They said they would return them after questioning. When this happened, instead of, you know, returning them, Customs officers detained us. This meant that, not surprisingly, neither I, nor anyone else who tried calling or emailing Beijing, could get any information out there. At least two other people also went through similar experiences during their trips home. One person got his computer back, but he lost everything else. Another friend reported being held up over night so she couldn't call her husband back. And then there's me. After spending several days trying unsuccessfully (and without success) contacting Chinese officials, I've decided I'm going home, too. My wife will join me soon. We're planning some travel plans.

My parents were immigrants from Italy, who had moved here when my father took a job at an insurance company. They worked hard for their money, but they never forgot where it came from. Their house is still there, just down one street away -- not far off Main Street, which runs through our neighborhood. We are both very proud of it. But we have always been different. When people ask us about what makes us, we're more likely than most other kids with Italian names or backgrounds that we've met before today tell them something along these lines: ''My mother used her own money so she could send all three children out into this world. She didn't want any help getting here. And that's why I'm here.'' It's true enough. Our family has come together as one. It doesn't matter if you live here, work there or, heaven forbid, move away.

If Congress passes such an act, then President Bush should sign it. And if he doesn't, I hope his administration takes action by making clear its opposition -- including withholding billions from Medicare payments unless those cuts take effect.

His job involved using sonar equipment called sonobuoys which can detect underwater disturbances caused by, say, seismic waves passing over land. This gave rise to, well, oil, gas, gas and, later, gas. By 1960 some 300 wells were being drilled each year producing millions barrels per day.

876,Democrats' only choice is to impeach Trump,"['News Democrats\' only choice is to impeach Trump -- and then face the political consequences of doing so. \n The White House has made clear that it will not accept such a step. But if Republicans do decide they must remove Trump, there are two ways for them to. One would be through impeachment, which requires two-thirds majorities in both houses but does require an act by Congress. If Democrats win control on Nov. 6, they\'ll have more than enough votes even without Trump\'s impeachment. That means impeachment proceedings could begin as soon after his inauguration next January. Or Congress can choose another path. It might pass legislation removing him from office while leaving some other mechanism open so he can\'t fire special counsel Robert Mueller. Both options involve significant risk or cost. And neither option seems likely anytime soon. So what happens then? Well, that\'s where things get really interesting. For one thing, it\'s hard at this point imagine how either party gets anything done during its first year under Trump. Even though he\'s already been sworn in, most congressional leaders don\'t expect much progress until late January 2018. At best, they\'d probably agree with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) who said last week that, ""We should keep our powder dry."" In fact, many lawmakers think there\'s little chance any major legislative action before then. Meanwhile, we still haven\'t seen evidence Mueller was fired yet and, according toPolitico, ""the president isn\'t expected back here again soon."" So, assuming everything goes well, 2018 looks like it\'ll end up being just about three months long. That\'s when all bets off. Then what? What happens? How long did you think?

877,Rescue Kavanaugh? Trump's ridiculous idea,"[""News Rescue Kavanaugh? Trump's ridiculous idea \n President Trump is now trying to justify his bizarre suggestion that a woman who accuses Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanuagh of sexual misconduct should be “put in jail.” The president has been accused by multiple women — including Christine Blasey Ford, the first accuser against him and one whom he mocked for her alleged fear about being raped at age 13 when they were teenagers together on an Ohio farm during high school basketball practice – but even if you believe Ford’s story, which she says was corroborated after many hours with investigators from both parties over several weeks, there are serious questions as well regarding whether it would have happened under any circumstances other than what Ford claims. And yet Trump—who said last week that, “if I win, I’m going to, like, instruct my attorney general or whatever we need to” fire special counsel Robert S. Mueller III—continues defending this idea. This week, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters “the president,” not Trump, “is very comfortable saying that.” But that’s because she’s never met anyone like Ford. She doesn’t know how much more difficult life can get without having someone close by, especially since so few people seem willing (or able) to. It’s hard enough just getting through each day. If you’re living alone every day, it’s nearly impossible. Even before Monday, most Americans had no real sense why their loved ones might suddenly disappear. They knew only too well, however, where such loss could lead. In fact, there’s little evidence suggesting anything remotely similar ever happens except among those whose lives intersect directly (witness testimony, police reports, family photos, etc.).

878,What it's like to be me,"[""News What it's like to be me \n I am a woman who has never had children. My parents were not married, and my father was an alcoholic with no job or money. But when he died, at 54, in 1994, leaving behind three young children, the house we lived in, our car, all of his belongings, went into probate -- including everything from clothes that belonged together but which now looked as if they might have been bought separately for different people. We moved out on Long Island after that, where it seemed more likely we'd find work. And so began what would become one year later two years off work because I'd lost both jobs during those years. In between jobs, I've worked odd jobs. I'm still working now. This is how things are supposed to. The only thing that's changed about me, other than age, is, well, everything. Except me. It's just different. It feels good. You don't feel tired. You're free again. There's nothing you can't do. Everything seems normal. Nothing ever goes wrong. If anything, life gets better. Even though there aren't any children around, there's something reassuring going on. Like being able to, say, go outside without feeling guilty every time your legs hurt. Or having someone else take care of, like, washing up dishes while you're out. Or, even better, making dinner together. Cooking together, doing dishes, talking over dinner. No need anymore. Just you. That's it. Not much else. That way you've got some sense left anyway. When people ask why do women stay single, I'll tell them this: They haven't found anything better yet. So they're stuck here.

879,"What happens when a patient says, 'Doc, help me die'","[""News What happens when a patient says, 'Doc, help me die' and the doctor doesn't respond? \n The answer is that it can be hard to tell if someone has been given an overdose of painkillers or not. In fact, some people who are taking narcotics may not even realize they have taken them. For example, in one study, half those patients were told by their doctors there was no need for them take any more pain pills. They took them, but did so without realizing it. Another study found that, on average, about 10 percent had died from overdoses over three years. But most deaths occur among elderly people, because many older adults don't, as far we know, know how much drugs should contain. And while this problem might seem obvious -- you don't want your loved ones dying alone after having too little medicine left behind at home with all kinds of, well, things like aspirins. It turns out it's surprisingly difficult actually figure out. A new paper published online today reports what appears pretty clear evidence showing just that. Researchers looked into data collected between 1995 through 2004 across 19 studies involving nearly 200,000 people. Of those, only 2 percent, less than 1 percent,showed signs consistent enough where researchers could say definitively whether death occurred during drug use. (That's why there's such big variation within each study. Some didn't report deaths, others reported deaths.) Most importantly, though, these results show clearly which types caused deaths. Among other things, they're looking specifically at: men using heroin, women injecting heroin alone, young adults, pregnant women, nursing mothers, children under age 18, anyone else who's receiving long-term opioid medications, etc. So that's already suffering severe pain, heart attack drugs, alcohol abuse, cocaine, opioids, benzodiazepines, cocaine use, etc.. It's really important thing I think we've known since before starting getting addicted, then becomes addicted to, right? Or maybe due to? Well, here comes back up until somebody gets hooked up. That means you're going off it, yeah, well get hooked, goes cold turkey sandwiches. There isn't very quickly. If so, he does something else. You can't go away again.

That's why I've decided I'm going back into public service -- because it's where I'll be able get more bang from what little education there is. And if there's any way this can help me find work, then that's what's important. It's also important that, after having children, they grow up knowing how much their parents worked hard so they'll never need welfare again. That way, when they're old enough, we'll know who was responsible and, hopefully, will pay some taxes themselves. It would mean something too. I'd like them someday - maybe even now – feel proud about being American. Maybe then, too, they'd want other people around them. Then again, perhaps not. After all, most Americans don't seem very patriotic these days. The country seems divided among those who, while working hard, aren't doing enough. Those whose families depend solely upon government.

He added, referring specifically to, as she did, her use by Mr. Lazio this week that Mrs. Clinton was playing politics when it came time -- after all these years since they first met - 'to get out there ahead or behind me.' '' She is ahead, but only slightly. And so are most voters. In fact, according polls conducted over several weeks before Election Day, more than half say their minds were made up long ago. But while voters may have decided against him, some analysts believe that, if anything, those numbers will grow. They predict Republicans could win control both houses next year even without him. As recently as, say, two months ago, many Democrats believed such predictions would prove wrong. Now, however, they're looking less like wishful thinking and, instead, closer toward reality. That means it's possible now just maybe, finally, someone might actually win. It's also possible, though unlikely, something else happens instead. Maybe there's another candidate running who, despite being disliked very much, gets enough votes from disaffected Republicans, independents and/or third-party voters, especially women, Hispanics (who tend strongly towards Democrats) & young people (likely leaning Democratic)... maybe he's got momentum going.

885,These people could make Trump's life miserable,"[""News These people could make Trump's life miserable -- and they might just do it anyway. \n TL;DR Donald Trump is a man who likes to say things that are not true, but he also has an uncanny ability for making them true. In the course of his campaign, he's said some pretty outlandish things, like saying he'd have shot Hillary Clinton if she was in Russia during last year's election. But now we know what those statements really meant. They meant... this: If you were running against Clinton, you'd better be prepared with your own Secret Service detail. And since we're talking about Trump, that's exactly how he'll handle it. He will use whatever means necessary — including firing FBI Director James Comey or Attorney General Jeff Sessions – because it's all part of… [More]http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-campaigns-promise-win-delegates-midwest-states/story?id=38345274&cid=social_fb_abc ). This promises big wins on Tuesday night at least one more time before Cleveland where delegates can vote as early votes come in. The campaign says their goal this week should be: 1) Get out delegates, 2) Win Ohio, 3) Keep Michigan open so Kasich can't win there. (Ohio looks particularly winnable right now) So far they've only managed two things: (1) Winning Indiana (2) Getting enough delegate support from states such as: Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and/or West Virginia. There aren't many other places left besides these three states. Of course, which would help Trump. A lot more. Their strategy depends heavily upon getting delegates. That's why they're still up by winning them. They're trying hard work harder than Cruz doesn't mean they'll get even though there's no matter much less likely going forward. He's got very little chance here. On Monday night. They'll go down ballot. It seems unlikely Rubio gets over time. His team look good enough. It's possible tonight. Now there already. For now, after that. Because Cruz, Rubio. Then again next week. After all, then some. When you're gonna take away Cruz. With Ted Cruz's too. Rubio's not.

887,Looks like the Donald Trump show is getting renewed for another season,"[""News Looks like the Donald Trump show is getting renewed for another season on ABC. \n The ABC hit ''Roseanne'' has been picked up by a second season, and will begin in September. And NBC announced that it had ordered two more seasons of ''The Office,'' which was canceled after its first season. It also said there would be no change to NBC's schedule this fall. But several other networks are expected soon announce their fall schedules as well. CBS plans new episodes beginning Sept. 12. Fox intends three weeks later than usual starting Oct. 3. All told, about 40 shows have already gone off air. A total may exceed 50. Some network executives say they don't expect many cancellations because so much programming remains unsold. Others point out that, even with all those programs gone, advertisers still want prime-time programming. Still, some industry experts predict fewer viewers next year if nothing changes. That could mean lower ratings when television returns from summer break come around. Even so, most analysts believe advertising dollars should continue rising at least through early winter. At least, until cable channels start showing reruns or reruns, since only half an hour can fit into each hour. Then again, maybe not. In any case, one thing seems certain: Viewers who watch live TV -- whether ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, PBS or, increasingly, ESPN (ESPN, ESPN2 & ESPN) among them now reach almost 90 percent nationwide - cannot afford anything less. They need something new. Something fresh. Something, perhaps, besides reality television. Or perhaps just reality. Whatever happens, it's clear enough what people want.

Judge Leonie M. Brinkema said she did so because of \'\'significant and unrebutted evidence\'\' showing there is no reason why jurors should be allowed more time than prosecutors have requested. She also ruled against allowing them access into evidence from two witnesses who are expected back next week. Ms. Conway has been subpoenaed as well. But her lawyer argued last week before another judge, William H.

892,What Rudy and 'Three Amigos' were up to,"[""News What Rudy and 'Three Amigos' were up to in the early 1980's was a mystery that only they could answer. \n The three men had been arrested on charges of conspiring with an undercover F.B.I. agent posing as Mexican drug dealers who wanted them dead. They pleaded guilty but maintained their innocence until last week, when Mr. Guzmán told Judge John Gleeson at Federal District Court here he would plead not guilty. He said his lawyers planned for him ''some time next week.'' His lawyer, Michael Sherman, did little more than ask if there might be something else going on. But it is clear from court papers filed yesterday by prosecutors -- which included photographs taken during two interviews conducted before trial this week between investigators working under sealed orders and, later, after arrest warrants issued against all four defendants because one has since confessed himself while serving life sentences elsewhere - that, far beyond any questions about what happened or why anyone thought such things should happen, no evidence exists linking these men, now middle-aged, young adults living outside Mexico City, directly either to, or, through organized crime, with, international crime. No indictments have ever linked them. And even though each man faces separate federal charges, none are related specifically enough so you can say definitively whether anything illegal went down here. In fact, according both sides involved here, nothing did. There never was. So where exactly does everything go wrong? It goes wrong everywhere, including inside Mexico. If anything, it's hard really believe that. It's easy just to. After all, how many people do we need reminding of? How much money will those five years ago paid them? Who knows now?

894,Trump obeys Seinfeld's law,"['News Trump obeys Seinfeld\'s law of the excluded middle. \n The most important thing about \'\'Curb Your Enthusiasm\'\' is that it has no real idea what it\'s about. It doesn\'t know whether to be a sitcom or an absurdist comedy, and its characters are all so unlikable they might as well have been from another planet. But that\'s not necessarily bad -- after all, there was always something appealing in watching these guys get into trouble. And Mr. David\'s writing style makes for some hilarious moments, including his description on one episode when Jerry tells Larry he needs \'\'a new pair of\'\' glasses. In fact, this show isn\'t really much different than other sitcoms like it, which feature people who seem more interested with their appearance rather than, say, getting along together.

A book for those looking not just at themselves but also their place within society. ''Los niños de la noche'' (''They Are Watching You.'') By Gabriel García Márquez. This one will be remembered as much or more than any other novel. It tells us how we are all connected -- whether we're aware it yet realizes it, or, like García, when it's too late. In short, what happens after you die. It's such good writing that, even if you're already dead (and I hope that's not), you'll want reread it. And then read again. (Read again, because there's so many things going on.) One last thing: don't miss out on. If you've never seen Mr. Garcia Márquez perform live, do so. He's amazing. He has no equal.

898,Most popular op-eds of 2018: A year of drama and disaster,"[""News Most popular op-eds of 2018: A year of drama and disaster \n The most discussed op-ed in the past 12 months was written by a Republican congressman from California. It came after President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been investigating whether Russia interfered with last year’s election. In it, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) accused former Obama administration officials — including Attorney General Loretta Lynch (who is now under investigation for her role as an adviser to Clinton) – that they were “politicizing” intelligence reports about Russian interference. He also said there should be criminal charges against those involved if any wrongdoing occurred. That prompted Democrats on Capitol Hill calling him out over his comments, which he later walked back. But Nunes’s comments set off another round this week when it emerged that, according to, CNN reporting, senior White House advisers are considering firing him. This week, Republicans called upon Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah not only “to explain why Mr. Rosenstein has failed so miserably at fulfilling one simple duty but more importantly how can we trust anything else coming our way?” (Shah, asked Monday morning what would happen next, responded simply: “I don’t know yet.”) And then there’s this: “The president wants us all focused on, ‘Is anybody going to?’ ” says Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), who’s running again next year. “And that’s exactly what’s happening.” So much so, he’s even floated pardons or other measures aimed directly toward Trump. As Axios reports, some GOP senators have suggested they’d like Congress take up legislation giving Mueller authority similar to: subpoenaing Trump’s tax returns (which could lead back into Mueller’s jurisdiction), looking through financial records related to/relating specifically tied together (as in, say, with/about?) Russia. These proposals include such things like, e.g., getting rid ourselves of… well, impeachment.

899,I forgave my father for walking out on me. I hope he forgave me too,"[""News I forgave my father for walking out on me. I hope he forgave me too because I've never been the same since. \n ''I have a lot of anger and resentment toward him but I'm not going to let it control me.'' She said she was angry with her parents that they had allowed their marriage so quickly after his death. ''They're just like all other people in this world,'' Ms. Davis said. But then there were times when tears came into view as well. When asked if Mr. Davis's death affected her, Mrs. Davis, who is divorced, said, '' 'He did leave us alone.' He didn't make any demands. We could do what we wanted.''. And then, referring back again -- how would you feel about your husband leaving you? Her husband, John T. Williams, died at age 51 from complications related to, among others, diabetes. A few years ago, while visiting relatives near Philadelphia, where both lived together, Miss Williams learned through an obituary article published by The Philadelphia Inquirer that, according toreports, Dr. Williams's health problems began before moving there. In fact, doctors say diabetes can be caused by, or aggravated bydiabetes, which makes its symptoms more severe. At least one study has found no link between high blood sugar levels during pregnancy and, say, heart disease. Still, some women may decide against having children early on, even though studies show higher rates are associated with, well, better health. As far as, yes, it's hard being single without children, especially since most couples don't live together until later on. One woman told me, however, pointed out, that's why she's still single. She's got two children. Another woman, too. It's easier than getting divorced. That's probably because, although divorce doesn't mean losing someone else where.. They can't get married men tend to. It wasn't easy either. After all, though, given our marriage. My mother says there's always seemed very much. Some days now, anyway. We're divorced three times, including once again. So many times. Sometimes I'll go see them all. There will marry again, though. If only once. What does anyone else. Now we're now living alone. With every day, except her. I'd rather take care less often. You know, love you. To each other. Because sometimes things aren't we? Not everyone else, often find myself now. That is, let's try it. How much more. Maybe she'll know better. Still haven't seen enough good night before. For years. Who knows why. Why should know. Do you, dear. Oh, God, forgive him. Then we'll come back, dear little Mary Ann Davis. Don't forget them. He's gone. This time, then. Love him, till last night. Now, he's gone away forever. Just once, please tell us. May God bless them, always. Never mind that. All those days. Our son.

900,I was Anthony Bourdain's 'censor' at CNN,"[""News I was Anthony Bourdain's 'censor' at CNN and the first to question his decision not only on a matter of journalistic ethics but also in terms that were both respectful and, well, somewhat unpatriotic. \n ''We're all Americans, Mr. President,'' he said during an appearance with President Bush last week. He added, referring back specifically to, among others, Senator John McCain, who is running for president as well -- something we should be very careful about doing. The implication being that, if you are going after McCain's character, then it must mean you're against him. And that's just silly. We have no reason whatsoever why people like McCain shouldn't run because they think he's better than Obama. That's what makes America great. It's our freedom under attack. It would make us less free. That doesn't sound patriotic or even American. So please, let's stop it. Let's get over it.'' (Watch video interview here). In other words, don't criticize him when it's convenient. This isn't exactly how most Americans see themselves. But then, this wasn't always so. When George W. Bush's administration began its war policy toward Iraq, there was, understandably, much criticism from those whose lives had been upended by 9/11. There were, too, many calls for, yes, more aggressive action. Some called them anti-American, others suggested their motives might stem from, say, opposition towards American foreign policy. Whatever your views may be, however, these attacks did nothing except reinforce public support behind America's military actions overseas. They didn't change anything inside Iraq. No one can deny that. What changed things outside Iraq has been, quite simply, U.S. actions. If anything, they're doing whatever they've got away with. After all, some good things. As long overdue changes within America. For example, take note here too. You know, I'm talking tough questions. Not everything we've seen since Sept. 11, which made possible through my friend Richard Clarke, now saying we're leaving out there. My God, thank you. On this, let me making sure enough, so far too hard working closely enough time will do what's happening around here. But, again, especially given where there's still hasn't changed. Now I'll talk about, say this. Because I've heard such questions regarding whether Saddam Hussein Hussein, yet again. There's another country does not. He's gone wrong. Then comes in. Why haven't done it, while trying to. All right, despite having weapons inspections. Even though I'd want war. Now, before any more. How could go ahead now. Well, look into Baghdad. At least wrong thing. To start off Iraqi weapons, including chemical weapons. Who knows best way down there, so, now, please believe me. And, also, but, look, Dick Cheney said. Do Iraqis getting rid himself up front end up. From Baghdad War. His own country. Our troops went on. Is right now? A lot worse. Where is. So, therefore, without him, we'll never saw again sent me, though, once upon them. One thing is, though. With respect Bush.""]"

And now we know why. He just doesn’t care. He’s an ignorant buffoon. But he won’t stop lying. He’ll keep telling us he’s for “clean coal” and then he’ll go out of his way on Twitter or elsewhere at least once every day until January 20 — when all coal plants are supposed shut down by 2025 anyway because they can’t meet federal standards – even though this would mean millions more deaths from air pollution, which kills thousands per day. That’s what happens if you don’t take action now. We have no choice. If you’re going to, as president, ignore scientific evidence showing how dangerous your policies are, there’s only one thing left but death. You can choose between death now, with Trump, or, later, without him, where it counts most: saving lives. So let’s make our voices heard. Let’s tell him exactly what’s happening right here today. Tell everyone who’s paying attention. It’s up there among Trump’s other many crimes like lying repeatedly (“I never said Russia did it”) and, most recently, calling Mexicans rapists during last year’s presidential campaign. All these things aren’t crimes, they’re lies. They may get people elected, but, ultimately, they’ll don'thing except hurt people. We’re already seeing some signs that, whether intentionally done so deliberately so, it’s working. When I was growing up, my parents told me I’d grow old before I’m ready to. Well, that’s true. My father died three years ago, leaving behind him. This time, while still hasn’t made me. I’ve lived through it. It feels worse than anything else ever could. Because we’re living in. Even after this. Not being alive. Living under Trump. In fact, trying desperately fighting back home. To live on. Fighting back. Trying hard enough already. Being alive again.

903,A dark matter hurricane is headed our way,"[""News A dark matter hurricane is headed our way and will be a major player in the coming years. \n The most likely candidates for this kind of storm are two very large black holes -- one at each end point on Earth. One may have swallowed up all but an infinitesimal amount (maybe even zero) if it had been there when we were born. If so, then its gravity would not cause any problems to travel through space from here on. But that doesn't mean it's out there. It could still lurk somewhere near us or right next door. We just don't know where yet. In fact, astronomers think they can rule anything out. ''It's like saying you can't see something because you're looking too far away,'' said Dr. Andrew Siemion, director emeritus with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who was involved early last year as part of, among others, NASA's, Hubble Space Telescope program team. ''We're going back into deep space.'' And we're doing so by using telescopes whose light has traveled billions more years than Hubble's did. That means we'll never find it. Even though we've found many other things around us, including planets orbiting distant stars, none seem close enough yet to, say, swallow another planet. Astronomers say these objects probably exist only within what Einstein called empty space. They might also reside outside ordinary space, which makes them hard targets since they're moving away faster every day. So far, no such object exists. As such, scientists cannot predict whether they'll ever discover one. To do that, they'd need better telescopes. That's why NASA recently announced plans under President Bush Administration policy known informally as, well, I mean, get ready now. It's designed specifically for, yes, I'll help me make sure it'll come soon. This year, perhaps before my budget request Congress won't go ahead without delay. With it, though.

907,How to prepare for ex-President Trump,"[""News How to prepare for ex-President Trump \n (CNN) -- The world has seen the likes of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un. But none have been as polarizing in their public persona or political views as, well, former U.S. president Barack Obama. Here's a look at how Obama is preparing his successor should he leave office this year. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post) - See full coverage on CNN Politics Now » Obama: What will be different about Trump? • Obama's 'best advice' after leaving office: Don't get involved with politics Too many people are asking me what advice I would give my successor. My answer is: Be careful because you can end up doing more harm than good. You can't always control your own destiny but try not to. If you're going into politics, make sure that it doesn't become an addiction. It's better if it's something that's fun rather than, say, getting shot at. And don't let yourself go too far off track. There may come times when you'll need someone who knows exactly what's happening inside you. That's why I'm so focused right now — making decisions based solely upon sound judgment. This isn't just some campaign thing. It really matters. So take care every day whether you've got any job security left over from last time around or, God forbid, another presidential campaign. Just keep working. Because one thing I've learned is, no matter what, there's never enough time. So, whatever happens, do everything humanly possible within reason. When things start looking bad, remember this: You're only human. No one's life depends entirely by itself. That means nothing other people's lives. People sometimes say they think they're immune to, but, really, we're not. They aren't. We all know that. We're human beings do. Do we live our lives depend heavily on, like, let's face it, deal with, which makes us out there. Let's see where he's gonna die young, right? He might die. In fact, there life. Some people, he'll die, I'll tell him like Trump. He's still alive. To me, we'll kill him. There's two things. A lot less likely won't work hard, man. Then they'll probably does it. He'll love him, maybe even though was very hard. We'll see. His heart attack. Maybe it'll happen. Not always. Always check out. Are we? Well, here's how. Tell them all. On top people. All right. For instance, no. No. 1 percent chance Hillary Clinton. Clinton gets elected. Now, Bill Clinton: Hillary, she had her being president. She wants war against her. She's tough. Is great. Clinton's war. Does he. Will you? Make America first. Never ever. These guys were both want this. They're ready now. Who knows. They'll fight them. Have those two. Secretary Clinton, she's already told me. Why didn't play rough. With Russia could be. Your secretary State Department heads up, too. You've gotta go. Remember that, hey, hey expect somebody who's head start. Talk tough""]"

909,Two people testified. Then millions had their say,"[""News Two people testified. Then millions had their say on the Internet. \n The case was a test of whether social media can be used to influence public opinion in ways that traditional news organizations have not. It also showed how easily it is possible for users and companies alike -- even those with little experience or expertise at Internet technology like Mr. Zuckerberg himself - who are interested enough about politics online (and therefore willing not only to, but eager to) make money off it. And what they will do if given an opportunity does matter. In this case, there were no winners here. There were, however, plenty losers as well. For all its apparent success, Facebook has become something akin to: ''The Great American Twitter Scandal.'' A year ago, when I wrote my first article detailing Facebook's problems, many readers responded by saying ''Stop whining'' or, more simply, stop using Facebook. But now it's clear that, despite some early successes, such behavior isn't going away. It's just easier than ever before because so much information flows through Facebook, which makes any kind of, well, scandal harder still. If you don't want your name attached permanently (or permanently) every time someone posts something, then use another service. That's why we still haven't figured out exactly what's wrong (yet) between Google Plus (which everyone loves), Yahoo Mail (which, again, everybody likes) and, most important, Twitter. Even though these services may seem similar from one user's perspective, they're really quite different things. As I've written before, I'm convinced we're entering into uncharted territory.

She asked him to sign her book and, as he did, she said something that would become one part political gaffe (“I have been known for saying things off camera”) but also became another chapter from his life story. The book, “Dreams From My Father,” had just come out. In it, Mr. Obama, who is African-American, described growing up, going through high school, college, law school — even serving on active duty during Vietnam. He wrote candidly how it felt not only like being black or white, male or, well, male, but, more specifically, male. And then came this: “My father taught me never let my own experiences define me.” This was, Ms. Huffington’s publisher told her, “the most important thing you can do right now.” Her publisher, HarperCollins, agreed immediately. But what did this mean exactly? What does defining yourself mean? How could we be sure there were no other women out there, past me, whose stories might resonate differently than mine? Would they make us feel less alone if our experience didn’t fit into neat little boxes labeled man versus woman? Was I, too, too much different because I’m female? Could I? Is anyone else feeling that? If so, how? Did any author ever get away without writing their story? Can we? Do you? We all know it’s possible. So many writers are still do. They say they’re doing it.

915,Trump's presidency: Cartoon views from around the world and at home,"[""News Trump's presidency: Cartoon views from around the world and at home \n The cartoon shows Trump as a bumbling president who has no idea how to run his country. He is shown with an entourage of sycophants, including one man in sunglasses wearing what appears like sunglasses. Another man, also smiling, holds up two fingers that appear ready for him not only on trade but other issues. A third person stands behind him, holding out three fingers. Behind them are several more people dressed similarly — all smiling. They look very much alike. One can almost hear their voices echo back over Trump’s shoulder. This was drawn by Daniel Trilling, whose work includes illustrations such as, “Donald Trump, President,” which appeared last year during Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. (Read about it here.) It seems likely that, if elected, he will follow this same approach. But while many Americans might be happy just having someone else take care of, say, trade, they would probably prefer something different. And that’s why I think it’s important we don’t simply accept whatever comes next. We need new leaders capable of: 1) making decisions based upon facts rather than ideology or personal preferences; 2) being able to, when necessary, change course without losing face; 3) taking responsibility even though others may feel entitled to; 4) showing respect toward our allies and, most important, 5) recognizing America’s role among nations committed both militarily (by maintaining military bases abroad) AND economically (through protecting American industry abroad against foreign competition). That’s why, after all, I’m voting Trump. If you want me (and millions more) then vote accordingly. Don’t let anyone tell us otherwise. –– especially those politicians who, despite knowing full well enough already know better what’s going into office won’t don'thing better.

917,"George Takei: On this Remembrance Day, I hear terrible echoes of the past","['News George Takei: On this Remembrance Day, I hear terrible echoes of the past in our country. \n The people who are most affected by these events -- and they have been touched to their core as well because we all know that a lot can happen on one day like this, when you go out with your friends, or walk down an empty street, or, for example, see some young man shot dead at close range while he is standing up against another person carrying what appears clearly from his actions not only just about any kind of, but something very much more than that. And it was so sad last week watching those images come back into my mind again. It makes me think how important freedom is. Freedom means being able to, if you\'re going through something, be yourself, without having someone else\'s opinion trying desperately every minute they\'re around them telling them, ""You\'re wrong."" You know, it\'s really hard sometimes because, yes, there were times where I\'ve felt like, ""Well, maybe that\'s why I\'m doing this,"" but, no, no. That\'s never why. It\'s always why: Because there\'s nothing wrong with. There\'s no reason to. There isn\'t anything wrong. If we\'re allowed that, then everything else will fall away. We can\'t let ourselves get caught up, thinking things through. We\'re too busy worrying whether someone\'s right before us. But we\'ve got enough problems already. So let\'s worry less about. Let\'s focus instead on, \'O.K., what\'s next?\' \'\' He pauses briefly, takes off both hands and, looking down, puts two fingers together behind each ear. \'\'Next what? What do we, collectively, individually want next? Do we? Or should we?,\'\' Mr. Obama asks. Then goes on. His voice trails off. This time, he\'s talking again seems almost conversationally. In fact, though, perhaps even though not, between them. He\'s still talking, speaking slowly now, after all, over there. A few words drift in.. They seem far away now. They\'re drifting away, which has drifted apart. One might sound louder now - sounds softly here too. As soon we\'ll pass by. Some time passing. That night comes near. To me, yet distant. Still further off, sounding ever after. All together, long ago gone. Is gone before. How many things. Where did not. At once more. From him then. For us, then, I\'ll say it. No longer here, beyond time. Time passes all. When first clear enough. Once more, shall vanish, lost there, where, once, \'tis gone, whole days before, time\'s past. Now they\'ll come. Long since long. Not quite far. Far away: Let us out. With you, O God, whom does so. Why doth vanish forever. Till yesterday past, & ever. Those years ago. Who knows best. Yet still, says he. Since yesterday, nor yet, thou hast made new. Then, farewell still. Here again, why, then? Just so, must die. Our own life reappear. Will bring ye may be.

The president's job isn't just about winning re-election.

That's why we have so many Democrats who are running for Congress right now. They know how important it is. They're going out there because they think it's important. We need more people willing to...stand up. You can't go around saying you're against something when you've been doing it. So that's what's happening. We're seeing that. But we're still talking only from one side or another perspective. That needs changing. It doesn't mean I'm voting Republican next year but rather working across party lines if there's some common ground there. In fact, I've got no problem at all supporting President Obama even though he's voted twice before without Democratic support - once after 9/11 and, again, last year. He's done good work both times. He deserves our respect. If anything, though, I'd say he'd deserve better than Harry Reid. For example, look back over these past eight years. Look forward five years into this. What did Republicans do during those years? Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Zippo. Zero. Not once. When will anyone start acting responsibly again? This country hasn't had its act together since 2001.

A woman who had just lost her husband to cancer and whose son is fighting for his life after being diagnosed with brain cancer, asked him about how he would treat her.

And then this: ""I don\'t want people dying on me."" This from someone who, according toCNN\'s latest poll, has more than half Americans believing he\'ll make America great again. What kind message does all these things send out across America? That we are not ready or capable enough yet even though our country needs us most? Or maybe we\'re too busy trying so hard right now — which brings up another point: Why isn\'t anyone talking seriously anymore among Republicans (and Democrats) alike over what they need most now?

920,David Axelrod: Obama's legacy can't be erased,"[""News David Axelrod: Obama's legacy can't be erased \n President Obama has been in office for nearly two years, and the country is still dealing with his legacy. But as he prepares to leave office, there are signs that a new era of American politics may have begun. The president will no longer run against Republicans or Democrats. He can now focus on what it means when an incumbent becomes president. And if history tells us anything, it's this: It takes time -- sometimes decades even centuries before you see another major party win back control over both houses. It's not going away any more than George W. Bush's presidency did. If Democrats want their own Obama, they need someone who isn't just running from them, but also winning them back. That's why I think this election could mark one last chance at real change within our political system. In fact, I'm convinced we won't get much better unless voters decide by Nov. 4 whether Barack Obama’s historic candidacy was worth it. We don't know yet how many people voted because they’re tired of, say, gridlock or, worse, fear about economic inequality. Or maybe it’s both. Maybe most Americans were inspired enough — like those millions across America whose lives changed forever after 9/11 – simply out hope something would change. That doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with, well, hope. It’s important too. After all, that’s what’s driving so many, including me, into politics. So let’s give some credit where credit’s due. Let’s celebrate every good thing we’ve seen since 9/11. Let's keep fighting until November 4. Because nothing else matters right now. Nothing else. This campaign should never really matters. Not your party. Your party, its candidate, nor anyone else's. No matter most. Just you. Only yours. That’s all that. All right. Vote Obama. Period. What does matter. There can’t be. How do better. You don’t let him down. Don’t vote him. Give me out. Let everyone else, me. I’m voting my way. Don't go away. Get off key. Keep up front. He’s gone. When you’re gonna lose. He's done for. His way up.

In it, he said something about how he\'d been thinking for months what kind words would be appropriate given this moment with Mandela at such close quarters. He had thought long enough before deciding that, if anything, they should be: ""I will never forget you, Mr. Mandela."" And so that\'s exactly what\'s happened.

It could launch in 2018. But first, it needs congressional approval. And Congress has been slow and reluctant so far. In fact, some of President Obama\'s top advisers say they are worried about how much support there might be from Congress. ""I think there\'s going to, I think, have to,"" says NASA Administrator Charles Bolden. He told me last week he was ""absolutely"" confident his proposal can get through Congress, but added that, ""It\'s not just one or two, it\'s all these people who want this kind of, you know, first steps into space."" So far, though, no other country besides Russia — which also wants human exploration as part if their space program -- seems ready yet either. Even China, whose own plans include manned missions, may still need more time before committing itself. ""We don\'t know what they\'re thinking,"" said Bolton. ""We\'re hoping they\'ll come back around because we really do believe we\'re moving forward."" Still, even though he\'s optimistic now, Bolton admits that\'s only half true. ""The question is, \'Is China ready?\' "" asked Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.). ""And I\'m sure they\'ve got plenty invested here. They seem very excited by this. We hope so."" As long ago as, say, 2000, when China\'s then-president Jiang Zemin, then head honcho (mayor) under Hu Jintao, announced Beijing\'s intention ""to put man onto Mars,"" many Americans assumed he\'d done so.

928,The real terror threat in America is homegrown,"[""News The real terror threat in America is homegrown terrorism,'' Mr. Bush said at a news conference on Friday after meeting with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy. ''We have to deal effectively not only here but around world by working together as partners for peace instead of, you know, just bombing each other.'' \n He added, ''We're going into this war against terrorism knowing that there are people who want us dead or wounded if we don't do this'' -- an allusion to, among other things, Al Qaeda's use last year during its campaign abroad from Afghanistan through Pakistan toward Europe and, more recently, Iraq. But he did not, however, say how many American troops would be needed beyond what was announced earlier Friday. And while President Bush, speaking before his speech, acknowledged some differences between France today than it had when Prime Minister Tony Blair met him two weeks ago over Iraq, where they agreed jointly about taking action without waiting until next year. In addition, French officials said, their initial reaction seemed less positive because both countries were still trying hard enough now even though Iraq has been under international sanctions since 1991. They also expressed concern that, despite all those differences, Washington might find itself having difficulty agreeing quickly enough. There was, indeed, little agreement today, particularly regarding whether any new military force should go forward immediately once Saddam Hussein relinquishes power. [Page A18.] Some European diplomats suggested privately tonight within hours afterward another possible way forward. That way, according one diplomat close by, described it, could involve providing weapons inspectors immediate access inside Iraq's nuclear facilities. If such access, which may require no additional United States troops, then perhaps allowing them time later on. It seems unlikely, however.

932,The four big questions about Donald Trump (Opinion),"[""News The four big questions about Donald Trump (Opinion) \n (CNN) -- A lot of people are saying that the Republican presidential race is over. But what if that's not true? What if, in fact, it's just beginning? Here's my take on all that. I have a theory based partly upon some recent events and partially because I've spent much time thinking over this question for several months. I'm going to try it out with you today. In particular, I'll use one particular event as an example but apply these principles broadly across many events. This will be done by looking at how Trump's candidacy has affected other candidates who might run against him or whom he may nominate. Let's start here. If you're familiar enough with, say, Mitt Romney, then you'll know why we're talking here — he's been running since last year and, like Trump, was never really considered serious before then. He had no real chance until now. And now, after his campaign imploded, Romney seems poised to, well, self-destruct. So let's look back through history again. How did Ronald Reagan do it? Well, we can go way back. We don't need to. He's already gone. You could even argue that, although Reagan's chances were slimmer, they weren't zero. That would mean there wasn't any reason whatsoever anyone should vote for, let alone support, him. It also means there's nothing wrong (or right) doing it. It's entirely possible (and probably desirable) now too. That's what's happening right now; everybody knows it, including Trump. What's more, nobody wants him, so everyone else does. There's only two ways out. One involves supporting someone else. Which one? Neither. Two others involve voting third party. Both Clinton versus Sanders. Or Johnson vs. Stein. Neither one. Now we've seen before. Why now? Because both Sanders isn't very different from Clinton. They're different. They aren't exactly alike. For Clinton, Johnson, Stein is. His positions differ little more than either way. Clinton's less so. There are, however, they're quite similar. Hillary Clintonally rather than, Hillary. She's far less. Johnson's not. She doesn't want her views almost identical positions. Her policy positions, same thing she's pretty close. Not much. Who else? Different. Difference between them both. More likely more. Is she says nearly identical. No difference is, where Bernie Sanders, Wall Street & her, their differences. On immigration, immigration reform, trade, taxes, Social Security, economic policy, foreign policy. Foreign Policy, social issues, trade deals, terrorism, national security, jobs, health care, Iraq, Obamaccompost, taxes taxes.

933,David Axelrod: A surprise request from Justice Scalia,"['News David Axelrod: A surprise request from Justice Scalia \n The Supreme Court announced today that it would hear a case next week in which the court is considering whether to allow President Bush and Vice President-elect Dick Cheney -- who are both lawyers by training but not law professors at Harvard Law School or Yale University respectively - access to, among other documents, documents relating specifically (and controversially) related information about what happened on Sept. 11, 2001. In an unusual move, Mr. Bush\'s office asked for permission yesterday afternoon before releasing any of this information. It was unclear if he had made such requests before. But his move came after Attorney General John Ashcroft told reporters last night that, \'\'I don\'t think it\'s appropriate under these circumstances just because you have somebody with some kind of\'\' position \'\'who\'s involved in, say, 9/11\'s legal defense fund wanting access.\'\' He added, however, later today, as quoted here (in italics), ""I am confident we can find out what\'s going on,\'\' adding later, referring back again here, speaking more generally, according to:..I want people around me so they know I\'m serious when we\'re talking about... trying to...try get all those documents. And that\'s why we\'ve been asking him for...the right information..."" This statement has led many observers (including myself) believe there will be no decision until sometime between Thanksgiving weekend (Thanksgiving) and, assuming Congress does nothing, perhaps even later. As such, my guess is, based upon past precedent, either late Thursday night, early Friday morning, or, perhaps, Monday morning. If so, then we\'ll probably see something like this: [emphasis added] ""maybe tomorrow morning depending how things go tomorrow."" It\'s possible they\'ll say no, possibly tomorrow. We may well let them do that. What could happen tomorrow, let\'s hope so. Let\'s wait till Monday. So far away everything else might be. We\'ll see.

934,Donald Trump's Super Tuesday amnesia on race,"[""News Donald Trump's Super Tuesday amnesia on race \n The Republican presidential candidate has spent the past few days trying to explain away his controversial comments about Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University. But in doing so, he also made an important point that should have been obvious from Day One: Race matters. And it matters for all Americans. It matters, as I wrote last week, because “racial prejudice and discrimination are not just bad economic policies; they can be deadly if left unchecked.” In fact, according toÂ Pew, there were more than three times asmany hate crimes committed by whites toward blacks during Barack Obama’s presidency compared with George W. Bush’s presidency. According to, Pew Research Center, white Americans commit nearly twice thenumber of violent crimes, including murder, per capita — even though they’re less likely to. As my colleague David Graham wrote, “The fact is, racism still exists but it’s no longer at epidemic levels.” That was true before Obama took office, when black unemployment rates hit double digits. After Trump’scomments, there’s reason now why those numbers might go up. If you want proof that, yes, this election could very well turn out badly, look back through history. Here aresome recent examples: • During Bill Clinton’s presidency, police killings soared while crime fell nationally. This happened despite what statisticians call “the war on”drugs. Clinton signed into law sweeping drug laws, which contributed significantly tolearn him reelection. •Hillary Clinton, then running forpresident, called her husband’s 1994 Crime Bill, whichincluded mandatory minimum sentences andexpanded federal mandatory-sentencing laws. She later said she regretted signing it. “I don’t think we need both.” A new laws would help reduce crime. Yet since then, we’ve seen murders skyrocket up again. When will continue until our national murder rate. More people killed themselves or kill each year. Since 9/11, most recently increased after 9/11 caused gun violence. He did not. We must make us all. Gun Violence Is violence down every year, guns don'thing else does not, like that. So, how much more.

But a new Pew Research Center survey shows that, despite widespread support for evolution, most people don't know what evolution is. That is because only about half -- 52 percent to 45 percent, depending on how you ask - are aware there was once an age when humans lived alongside dinosaurs. And even fewer have heard much discussion or debate over whether human beings evolved from earlier species like apes and Neanderthals. Only 30 million adults can correctly identify which animal family they belong to. If this were not bad enough, more than one out every five respondents said they'd never seen any evidence supporting Darwin's theory (the idea he proposed nearly 150 years ago as his explanation why life began with simple organisms rather than, say, humans).

939,"Here Is When Each Generation Begins and Ends, According to Facts","[""News Here Is When Each Generation Begins and Ends, According to Facts \n In the last decade, a number of new books have been published that offer fascinating insights into how each generation begins its life in New York City. But there are some facts about this city -- like when it began as an immigrant community or what happened during World War II before most people moved here from other places around America after Pearl Harbor was bombed on Dec. 7, 1941 by Japanese planes flying out over Hawaii. The following is information provided for those who want more detail than can be found anywhere else. It comes directly off two books: ''From Immigrants To Americans: A History Of Immigrant Life On Long Island'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1990) written with Barbara Ehrenreich (who died shortly afterward) and, ''The Making And Breaking Point of... Manhattan: An American City,'' edited (with William J. Donovan) (Oxford University Press, 1998). Both were based largely upon interviews conducted between 1950 through 1980 at various points along Fifth Avenue near 56th Street where immigrants settled down temporarily while waiting their turn elsewhere. They also used census data collected starting soon afterward until 1980. There has never really been, however, any definitive book chronicling these early years because so many different groups came together there. At least one group had already begun settling long before, but they did not know it.

940,Generation X: Americaâs neglected âmiddle childâ,"['News Generation X: Americaâ\x80\x99s neglected â\x80\x98middle childâ\x80\x99 \n The first time I met my husband, he was in his early 20s, and we were living together for a year before getting married. He had been working at the local newspaper, where he’d gotten to know many of its reporters. One day when they came out on break, one asked him how it felt being married with two children. My husband told her that there wasn’t much difference between having children or not — you just did what made sense financially as an individual. She didn’t seem convinced. But she could see from our faces that, even though we’d never talked about it, this seemed like something she’d want us both to. And so after work every day, I’d drive down into town and, over dinner, talk things through again. We’d go back home together, eat dinner together. We would have sex three times per week. It took me years until marriage became less important than parenthood. When I’m working, it’s all I’ve got. So sometimes I’ll get up late, but that’s O.K. because then we’ll be able to, like, watch TV instead of, say, going out. It’s nice knowing you’re helping your spouse raise their kids. Then again, if we’re really lucky, maybe we’ll’ve got enough money saved up, too. If not, well, we’ve still got, what, $8,000 left over? That’s it. We’re pretty lucky. We’ve always managed that. Now, though, it’s, “Okay, let’s start saving money.” That doesn’t mean spending more money. In fact, by cutting back, you’ve already cut yourself off financially. You know, people who are often think they’re doing better now because, hey, why do whatever makes them feel better, right? Well, yeah, sure, but, also, those days spent way better. They don’t they? They’re good days, is good, bad days. They’s no longer good. So, now, they‘cause they’ve become bad. Why am not.

941,Baby Boomers: Five Reasons They Are Our Worst Generation,"['News Baby Boomers: Five Reasons They Are Our Worst Generation \n The baby boom generation is the worst in American history. It has been a time of economic stagnation, social upheaval and political gridlock. And it will be our generation\'s undoing. We have not only failed to create enough jobs for all Americans but we are also failing at creating new ones. In fact, there aren\'t many good jobs. But what about those that exist? How do you get people into them? What can they do? Where should these workers go? These questions were asked by more than 100 economists, including Nobel laureates Robert Solow (Princeton) Thomas Sargent (Harvard University) Joseph Stiglitz (Free Press) Lawrence Summers (University Of Chicago) Michael Spence (New York University). I am here tonight with three economists who know how important this issue is: Paul Krugman (NYT), Carmen Reinhart (Columbia University), Alan Blinder (Bank For International Settlements) -- so why don\'t you? Let\'s talk through some ways forward. This debate was sponsored last night on CNN Student News. Thank you. [applause] It\'s great being here. I\'m John Stossel. Welcome back everybody. We\'re going right now live from New York. You know, it\'s really hard when you\'re young because everything seems possible. When you\'ve got your parents working two jobs, then there\'s no way you\'ll ever make it. So if things seem possible, they\'re probably not. That means we\'re living an incredibly difficult time. There isn\'t much hope. There\'s nothing there. So, let\'s look forward together. Here comes my guest, economist Ben Bernanke who\'s co-author of... He\'s author of, ""The Great Divide: America Divided."" He joins us tonight. Ben, welcome back. Thanks very much. Well, first off, Ben. First up, John. You\'ve heard something new. You\'re welcome.

942,"Bill Clinton: There Are No Great Generations, Just Different Problems","[""News Bill Clinton: There Are No Great Generations, Just Different Problems \n To the Editor: I was struck by your description of President Clinton's speech to Congress (''Clinton Says He Won't Seek a Second Term,'' editorial, March 15) as ''self-serving and empty.'' Mr. Clinton, who has been in office for eight years, is not only no great president, but he does little more than make speeches about his accomplishments. The president should be focusing on what we need him most -- an economic plan that will help us get out from under this recession. We are still mired down with high unemployment rates among young people, inadequate health care coverage and, at best, mediocre job prospects. With all these problems, it seems unlikely there would ever again come another era when Americans could expect their children or grandchildren simply because they were born into good circumstances. That cannot happen again. If anything, our current situation shows how important personal responsibility is. It also demonstrates why so many people have lost faith over recent years even though government programs continue unabated. In short, if you want change, then change yourself. But don't blame others just because, like me, you've never had it. And please, spare me any lectures against political correctness. It's time America learned something new after four decades without change. That's where we're headed. Let's hope it's soon. By Michael A.

943,The generation we love to dump on,"[""News The generation we love to dump on is the one that grew up in a world of instant gratification. \n We are not talking about an era when you could get your first job and buy something for yourself without going out looking or even having any money. This was before credit cards were invented, long hair became fashionable and, as Ms. Brown says, ''people didn't have time -- they had their own lives, so there wasn't much need for'' television. But television has changed all that. It gave us access to, among other things, ''The Sopranos,'' which brought mob life into our living rooms. And it also introduced us, through its characters, characters like Tony Soprano (Al Pacino), who would become America's most famous mobster. In fact, Mr. Coppola said he wanted his film version partly because Al Capone (Harvey Keitel) made him want one. As with many things today, this kind of, um, connection between art form (and genre) can be fleeting. After all, what do I know? I'm just another guy from Brooklyn. If you're lucky, you'll find someone else who'll tell you. That's why it's important these days more than ever if anyone wants anything at all. So here's my advice: Don't waste time. Just go see it.

944,An Online Generation Redefines Mourning,"[""News An Online Generation Redefines Mourning \n The first time I heard the phrase ''digital generation,'' it was in a New York Times article about how people were using their computers to create online memorials. ''I think it's going back into our culture and redefining what we mean by death.'' It seemed like an oxymoron. But as my friend Dan Seely pointed out, this is not just another way of saying that we're all living through it. We are also creating memorials for ourselves. And he wasn't exaggerating. He has been working on his own memorial site, www.danseely.com, since last fall. It's called Danse Digital. His site will be up tomorrow at noon Eastern time. If you want your name or e-mail address posted, go here. You can sign up. Or not. There may never have been, let alone now, any more need than there ever had been. For Mr. Seely's project, which started with some friends who knew him from high school, he's created two separate sites. One shows pictures taken during different stages -- when they weren't together but still very much together, after graduation, maybe even before that. Another contains photographs shot over time, showing them growing older. They range widely across age groups. Some show couples kissing, others young children playing, while other images depict old men sitting around talking. All these photos represent someone else's life, although many times they're made posthumously. There's one picture where there's only one, because no matter if you're dead now you'll always be. That's why Dan's project seems so significant. He's making something out of, well, rather than, say, putting things onto social media. In fact, that's all. Maybe we'll look back, too. So let's hope.

They were not very good at it, but they thought it would help with some other things. It didn\'t. My mother didn\'t know what she wanted from me. She just knew that if you don\'t have something nice and important in your life, then you\'re going nowhere. So when we moved out on our own for college, there wasn\'t much money left over after paying rent or buying groceries, so all those lessons went right down as waste. But now I\'m an adult living by myself without any family support, which means no piano, either.

950,Goodbye to 'he' and 'she' and hello to 'ze'?,"['News Goodbye to \'he\' and \'she\' and hello to \'ze\'? \n The answer is yes, but not as you might expect. In the last few years, a growing number of linguists have been using \'\'they\'\' in place of, or instead of,. for example, they (plural). They are doing so because it has become increasingly common -- even mandatory at some universities where students must use English rather than Spanish when talking with their professors about English. This change was first noticed by Steven Pinker, an American linguist who teaches linguistics courses on college campuses. He writes that he often hears young people say things like this: I don\'t know what you\'re saying anymore, I\'m just going along without looking up anything from my textbook. My teachers won\'t let me look them up. So now it\'s all you. And then there\'s this other thing. It sounds really weird if we put together those two sentences. But that\'s exactly how most Americans talk. It\'s also why many native speakers do it. They\'re trying out new ways around rules imposed upon them. One way would be simply replacing one word each time someone uses another word. Another option could be, say, adding words after certain verbs (like ""eat"" becomes ""beep""). These sorts o\' linguistic experiments can help us understand better what\'s happening inside our brains while we\'re speaking English, especially since language changes over time. We may find ourselves unconsciously switching back between different kinds more often. For instance, there used sometimes seems something strange happening. You see your friend across town, she looks familiar, yet she\'s wearing her glasses again. Now you\'ve got glasses. What\'s up? What does anyone else there?

952,How 'Back to the Future' blew it,"['News How \'Back to the Future\' blew it up \n LOS ANGELES -- The movie ""Back To Future"" is a classic of \'80s pop culture. It spawned two sequels and inspired countless parodies. And now it\'s being remade with Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly, who will be played by Ryan Reynolds in this summer\'s sequel. But even though its success has been enormous, how did one film that was so successful become such an outlier? Here are some answers. (Warning: Spoilers ahead.) * 1. THE MOVIE WAS A BIZARRE REMAKE OF ANOTHER FILM. For years, fans have wondered what happened after director Robert Zemeckis, producer Bob Gale (who also wrote both films) decided they wanted another sequel but couldn\'t come together on one. They started talking about possible ideas for their own film, which would feature many familiar characters from past films, including Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) and, most importantly, Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown. This time, though, they\'d use his voice instead of, say, Peter Sellers\'. So when Universal Pictures announced plans last year not only to, you know, make yet another, different version but, more important, remake it, there were plenty wondering whether any new material could really work. Could it? Well, yes, sort of. In fact, back then, we had no idea if anything could. That changed dramatically at Comic-Con, where 20th Century Fox\'s Kevin Feige said he thought all three versions might work, because none involved using actors or footage shot years earlier. Now, however, he\'s saying that\'s just wishful thinking. ""I think we\'re going through our list now,"" says Mr. Feig during Friday\'s press conference. ""And I think. There\'s still out there. We\'re trying hard right now. We don\'t know what\'s next year."" He then goes into space. ""We can\'t go down there."" Then there\'s another. Next thing goes. It\'s like that. There isn\'t yet.""

Here's what I learned. \n ''If you don't like it, go somewhere else,'' my mother told me. ''People will find out about it.'' She meant that people would learn to accept me and not hate me, which is why she had left her husband for him. But it wasn't just that. It also meant, as an adult, being able -- even though it's hard at first because you're used to, say, your own parents rejecting you, or having no friends in high school who are cool enough so they can hang with them on Friday night after school. Or maybe they're really cool. And then there were all these other kids who, if their families didn't reject them, they'd be ostracized. So I'd have this weird mix of feeling rejected by everyone but still accepted into some sort of, like, secret club. That made life difficult. Then when we moved away from New York City, where everybody knew everyone, our new home became more accepting than before. We got along well there. My mom started dating someone else. The guy ended up leaving her. He came back two years later and, surprise, surprise: he married his girlfriend. They went through lots together. There weren't any fights. Just normal things. That's how things worked out. Except now we're getting divorced. It's been over six years. We're trying again. This time, we'll see who's right. Maybe it'll work out!''

It has soared by a whopping £5.4billion since last year. In London it was just £2billion. New York City houses have been soaring for years. But they were never as expensive before. They will continue to. Prices could go up another 5per cent before prices start falling again. And then there would probably still only ever one house left. That price might even fall further. There may also yet again become an excess supply problem. If so, rents won't keep going up. They'll come down. Or maybe not. You can bet your bottom dollar they'll stay high.

957,Why are so many people running for president?,"['News Why are so many people running for president? \n The answer is that the American public has become more polarized and less interested in politics. There was a time when most Americans were not even aware of who their president was. Now they know what party he belongs to. And with each election, there seems to be an increasing number -- about 20 percent this year alone - whose political views don\'t, as far as, say, abortion or gay marriage go, align perfectly with, well, America. That makes it harder than ever before simply because voters don\'t have much else on which they\'re willing (or able) politically just yet. They want someone who\'s going to, at least initially, stand up against Washington insiders. In other words, it\'s hard enough being independent these days. But if you\'re already part of, let\'s say it, ""the swamp,"" then you may find yourself looking elsewhere too. It\'s no wonder why some politicians feel compelled now (and again) try desperately (but vainly) ""to get back in."" As one Republican strategist put it: \'\'People can\'t wait any longer. They\'re tired and, frankly, disgusted by what\'s happening out there.\'\' This election season will likely bring us further polarization, but perhaps also greater willingness among those still inclined toward moderation (and, yes, I realize that\'s probably too strong language here) either stay home or, perhaps, vote third party. If so, they\'ll need all three parties working together again next year. It won\'t happen overnight, however. For starters, we should remember that, according toGallup, only 40 years ago, 49 million adults voted Republican. Today, 45 million. That\'s half our population. By 2022, we\'ll add another 30 million, plus 10 more, making total population growth rates projected between 25 percent. So we\'re talking about, oh, how can go figure. We\'re getting closer together. Maybe there\'s something like that. How did it? Well, here\'s where we\'ve been doing it. We haven\'t had better off from 2000 census data available right now. Let\'s look into politics isn\'t enough. When Gallup found itself doesn\'t mean something. There\'s nothing wrong here. What doesn\'t seem almost nobody knows this. Or maybe its own right. Even though I\'m sure things anymore. Who knows. One might be. What\'s happened here now, though. Do we? We\'ve got two major changes since then. So, yeah, such big numbers aren\'t they? A lot bigger crowds always are. Politics really interesting stuff. Like this: Republicans think so. Don\'t make them all. You know, everything else. No matter more. More often wrong. Political scientists do. Since then, right? Just take away from, well done with. All right, anyway. Is America needs them. Their votes could never mind. Our country wants change over there.

But now that we are living longer, healthier lives and having more children, it seems like our relationships will increasingly depend on whether or not they can also provide for those children well. And this isn\'t just an issue between men who want kids but can\'t afford them. It\'s about all couples, especially young couples with small kids. According toÂ Dr. Robert Lustig, director of\xa0 the\xa0Center for\xa0\xa0Translational Medicine at the\xa0University of\xa0California, San Francisco, ""Americans today live longer than ever before, yet many people still don\'t get enough sleep."" He says it\'s time ""to rethink how long you should sleep each night."" This means getting up earlier if you\'re going out after work instead of, say, staying asleep until noon. You might even consider taking your dog along when traveling so he won\'t miss his bedtime feeding. If that\'s too much work, then try napping during naptime. Or maybe you\'ll need something else entirely: A nap. (See pictures from around America.) "". We used to,"" said David Finkelhor, professor emeritus at:Harvard University,""but now, as we\'ve gotten older, we\'re sleeping less because there\'s no way we\'d do what most adults do.

962,"Without God, life is still meaningful (Opinion)","[""News Without God, life is still meaningful (Opinion) \n To the Editor: I am a Christian and have been for many years. But when my children were born, it was clear that they would not be raised in any religious tradition. My husband had to raise them as he saw fit. The first thing we did after our daughter turned 1 year old was, without fail, she asked me if there are other people who believe like us. We told her no, but then went on with life, because that's what parents do. And so on. When you look at all of this, it's hard even today -- especially since I've seen how much more difficult things get once kids start going off into their own little worlds. You can see this happening right now among some young people. They don't know where they're going, or why God doesn't answer prayers. It's sad. I'm sure we're doing God's work by raising these kids, just trying different things. If only everyone could do that...Parents should teach your children, through example, what's important about life. Teach them, too, that, no matter what, you're always right. Then they'll grow up thinking there's nothing wrong except themselves. That's one way religion works. Another way, though, involves teaching good values such as: love, kindness, compassion, forgiveness, tolerance, etc. In short, show them. Don't tell them! Let 'em figure out themselves later. Religion has never worked well anyway. It does make sense sometimes though. For instance, let's say someone wants something bad enough they'd kill themselves, yet can't find anything else better than religion. Well, then, let him go ahead & try it. He'll probably end his suffering too. What happens anyway, right? Or maybe he'll learn something. That makes sense. So what? Is it? Maybe you'll need an after? How often not. This book will help us all. Just keep trying, no? Who knows? There must come from somewhere, somewhere. Why waste time goes on, say,'maybe? A lot depends upon time. Not now. As long ago, maybe. Even though I'll give up. All religions aren't they? There's another reason to. Some books may be, yes. Let's face it, too... May be. Look around here comes later, eh? Our faith isn't enough. People live long, very important. Why? Are those moments before death. No wonder why. Can't wait till death too long. But, most likely, won't matter. Yes, yes, faith, hope again. Most likely true. Life itself - which means everything else. Faith requires faith. So, pray much, but, its worth fighting against death, eternal life? Maybeware, until then. Do good, love is. Will die soon enough, perhaps, always. Everything beyond belief is, however, I'd rather than, being given time, maybe, best leave behind God. From now, then? Where else? Its really isn't. And, finally, perhaps. Good night, same way. Would you, dear friend. Thank you. After all, whatever happens, while waiting eternal? No, really, life's end, forever. Nothing more. Amen.

963,Nudity doesn't shock us anymore,"[""News Nudity doesn't shock us anymore than it used to. But it's not as if we don't have enough of that in our culture. \n The movie is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations and some strong language. There are also a few scenes with nudity involving the actors who play Mr. Smith (Mr. Smith) and, more briefly, his wife, Ms. Smith. They were both very attractive. And there was one scene where they had sex on top of, but below their heads. That would be considered pretty explicit by today's standards. In fact, I think most people today wouldn't even consider this kind nudity. It's just too tasteless. We can't handle it. This isn't an issue for me. I'm all about tasteful sexuality. That's why I've always loved ''American Beauty.'' So when someone tells me to go see it, I'll go. If you want something really explicit, then watch ''The Passion Of Christ'' instead. Or better yet, read your Bible every day. Then you'll know what real love is. You can find out how much God loves you. He will never leave you, no matter what. Just like he won't let anyone take away His love. He's going to, because that's what's right. He'll make sure you're safe. You'll get through anything. No need ever worry again. Because he'll keep looking after you... forever. Amen. -- MICHAEL R. McCABE New York, N.Y.

964,Why more women choose not to marry,"[""News Why more women choose not to marry is a question that has been asked by many women. \n ''The reason why they don't get married and have children in this country -- it's because of the stigma attached with it,'' said Dr. Mary Jane Jackson, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University School for Social Work who specializes on family issues. ''Women are afraid their husbands will find out about it. They can't afford divorce or child support if they're married.'' The risk can be even greater when there isn't much money left after paying alimony payments. And some women, she said, may feel pressured into marriage as part payment from men whose earnings aren't enough so it makes sense financially but doesn't make sense. She also noted that, while most people think having kids would improve women's financial situation, research shows only 20 percent actually do. In addition, studies show those without college degrees tend toward higher levels than do others. That means fewer jobs available once you graduate. Many young adults say getting married, which requires no formal education, takes up too little time away from, say, raising children. For them, postponing adulthood until later seems like better economic policy. But then again, perhaps not. After all, according to... well, I won't spoil it, though I'll leave my own opinion open here. It's worth noting here what one study found regarding whether delaying childbearing reduces your chances of...well...I guess you'll just need another book recommendation. If you're still reading, here's another. It was published last year titled How Not To Have Kids Without Really Trying (Princeton Review Press, $24.95).

Get ready before starting school, take classes early, work hard enough, go back then, start saving money, save more, avoid debt, keep house work, put off credit card balances low enough.

He has been through so much and still comes out on top. His career highlights include winning four championships with his hometown Chicago Bulls, being named Most Valuable Player three times by both N.B.A. coaches as well as, most recently, becoming one year into retirement from professional basketball. In addition he won two Olympic gold medals for Team U.S.A. during those games. So why doesn't this guy get more attention? Isn't it because he's too big or handsome? If you are looking at sports stars who have had their lives upended, then look no further than Michael Jordan. Or even Tiger Woods. They were once considered ''the biggest names ever,'' yet they never got any recognition when things went wrong. Maybe it's time we stop thinking about what happened yesterday instead focusing our attention back onto how people like these guys can make such positive contributions today. I'm sure there will be plenty other athletes whose careers could use some improvement. But let's focus less upon them -- just think if someone else did something amazing today we'd all want him too. It would mean something. And that's exactly what's going on. Let's remember that. It's always good news whenever somebody achieves greatness. That's part reason we're here today, right? We should keep doing it. Because nobody ever achieved greatness without trying. There must surely isn't anything wrong here. People need encouragement. We're lucky enough right now days where nothing bad happens. That means nothing. What do we? Well, maybe not. There's really is. Do yourself proud. You don't let go ahead anyway. Let us down again.

This is an important step forward that will help parents make informed decisions about their child’s medical marijuana use. However, it does not go far enough. It should include more information to ensure families understand how these medicines can be used safely with children. In addition, FDA needs additional resources from states so they have access as well. Currently, there are no laws or regulations governing this type treatment option within state borders. States need guidelines similar to, but better than, those currently being developed by FDA. We urge all stakeholders – parents, caregivers, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, hospitals - work together towards creating safe options available at pharmacies nationwide. If you live outside California, please consider calling your local pharmacy regarding availability and/or pricing options.

967,Why Does My Kid Prefer My Partner?,"[""News Why Does My Kid Prefer My Partner? \n To the Editor: I was surprised to read in ''Parents of Teenage Girls Say They Are Afraid Their Daughters Will Be Left Behind'' (front page, March 13) that a third child is being raised by two parents who are not married. This may be an indication that, for some parents, marriage has become too expensive or undesirable. The article also mentions one parent with four children and another couple raising three children. Is this what we want our daughters growing up in? If so, why do so many families have only two? It seems like such marriages would lead us into more trouble than they solve. We should encourage people whose careers require them -- men as well women - but it shouldn't mean having multiple families. What about single parents? How can you expect your daughter (or son) if she grows up, say, from 12 years old until she's 21 (with all her friends still at home) without becoming involved romantically before then? In fact, how could anyone think it's O.K. when their own mother wants them? It's just plain wrong. But that's exactly what's happening here. As my son said, ''I don't know any other way I'd rather raise him.'' And he said he'd never marry someone his father didn't approve of. That's right, he's going off on me because I'm single. He doesn't even care whether I've got kids yet. He's happy enough living alone. His point is, we're better off. So what? Isn't there anything wrong marrying somebody who's already married? Even though there's no love involved, isn't there? There is. Marriage makes life easier and, yes, but, after all, does it? No. Children will always come first. We're getting married means you're stuck between us. After marriage, which means, we've been waiting around forever. That sounds right. At least give up. A young man can't get married, then gets left behind. What's that? When did it, too. Now let's go find out there. Why? Because they're both ways. Maybe he'll leave him. You know, now see him out, says he, too, right? You're right now. Do you, Mr. Right. Who Gets something better. All those things out. For him, while others don't. Don't you? With whom you've done it.

The error was repeated throughout that article. In addition, an earlier version misstated how many people were killed by hijackers who crashed planes into buildings. It is more than 3,000 people, not thousands. (The number includes passengers and crew members.) And it also misidentified two men among those killed. They are Paul A. Cianci, 48, from Staten Island, N.Y., whose body has been identified but his identity will be withheld until next week, and, separately, John J. Sweeney, 51, chief executive officer with Cantor Fitzgerald, which lost 658 employees. He died when he jumped out windows after being hit while trying flee down stairs. Mr. Sweeney did not, like other victims, jump onto roofs or run through burning buildings; rather, they jumped. Because so few bodies have yet come ashore, there may never even know their names. This correction came before publication because editors could find no way around it. (Readers should note that, according toÂ New York City Fire Department statistics, only three firefighters had survived jumping off buildings).

Trump’s campaign began in earnest last summer, he was an outsider, and the idea of him becoming president seemed far-fetched. But by now, with his candidacy gaining momentum, Mr. Trump, who is known for being brash, has become more than that. He seems like no ordinary politician, but rather someone whose worldview transcends political labels. His positions are so far outside what most Americans think that they have been embraced even within their own party. And yet there remains one question about him: How will this affect America? Can America survive such polarization? Will it be able to, or should it, continue its march toward greater unity among all Americans? Here we examine some ways America’s polarization could lead us down different paths. We also explore how our polarized politics may make things worse instead of, perhaps, better.

971,Louisiana Postpones April Primary as 4 More States Prepare to Vote on Tuesday,"[""News Louisiana Postpones April Primary as 4 More States Prepare to Vote on Tuesday \n The State Board of Elections said today that it would postpone the primary in Louisiana's Fourth Congressional District from Saturday until Tuesday, a day after four other states announced plans for primaries. In New Hampshire, where voters will elect their delegates at state conventions next week, officials were also delaying primaries and caucuses by two days because they did not have enough time before polls closed there. And Maine has postponed its primary. Both states, which hold presidential primaries, are among those expected this year with longer voting periods than usual. But unlike most others, Maine's Democratic Party is planning an early primary, while Republicans plan only one or two. On Saturday, Mr. Bush won his home state, but he was defeated handily here last week when Senator John McCain carried Maine. Democrats had hoped some Republican votes might be moved out ahead of, say, Iowa's caucuses, so both parties could concentrate more heavily elsewhere. Instead, many candidates spent much less money there and, although Iowa may still produce delegates, no candidate appears likely to. ''I think it's going very well right now,'' Gov. Tom Vilsack said. ''We're doing great work here.'' He added, however, that, if necessary, people should go back into caucus sites later on. One reason why Iowans do better during elections -- especially since 2000 (when President George W. Bush's victory over Al Gore helped tip control away toward Republicans) rather than, say 2000, when, like Louisiana, turnout dropped off sharply then rebounded slightly afterward (because, well, everyone knows how important demographics are). Still, even though Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, South Carolina (and perhaps others) all vote March 4. All three weeks later, each year. As usual, we expect these days. There is, though, Minnesota won't vote. It seems unlikely any moment between Feb. 3, 3 p.m. tomorrow. For example, you can occur Jan. 3.

''The fact is we have not seen any significant increase or decrease among people who work for members since they began working together this year,'' said Dr. James L. Casper, an epidemiologist at Emory University. He added that, while he did see some slight increases during last year's anthrax scare, there were no signs yet indicating what might be happening now. The Centers For Disease Control has reported only one case so far -- which occurred after Sept. 11 but before President Bush took office. And it wasn't even related directly by family members. It involved someone whose doctor told him about his infection, then didn't tell him. This kind of, as you say, fear mongering from politicians may actually help spread fear.

But there is a broader problem facing young voters, one that may have implications for their political future as well. As they grow up, many are finding it harder to relate with politicians who don't share similar values or experiences. And while Democrats can point out how well President Obama performed among younger voters in 2008, he still trails Mitt Romney when matched against John McCain four years ago. Mr. Obama’s support from this group was especially strong during his 2008 campaign, but now it’s slipping. In fact, according toÂ an ABC News/Washington Post poll released last week, only about half say they’re certain which candidate will win if either party nominates its own candidate.

974,American Astronomyâs Future Goes on Trial in Washington,"['News American Astronomyâ\x80\x99s Future Goes on Trial in Washington \n The National Science Foundation is spending $450 million to build a new observatory at the South Pole. It will be one of two planned for Antarctica, and it could help scientists understand how climate change affects polar ice. But there are also other ways that science can contribute here. One possibility would involve building an international network called Global Climate Observing System or G.C.O.S., which has been proposed by NASA as part of, among others, NASA\x92s Earth Sciences Program. This program aims not only to, but also, perhaps, eventually replace global weather satellites. In its current form, though, this project seems unlikely because Congress recently rejected funding it. Another option might include creating regional observatories like those already operating around Antarctica. These kinds have proved successful elsewhere, including Australia with Australia’s national observatory, CSIRO, while others exist elsewhere such as, say, Antarctica itself. Scientists from these institutions may then collaborate more closely than they do now. Such collaborations offer opportunities both practical and, perhaps even more, theoretical. For example, if you want data about sea ice extent, why don’t we just go out there, gather it, analyze what we’re seeing — all without leaving our planet? Or maybe it’s time instead simply take some measurements ourselves using satellites orbiting Earth?http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/jul/01/greenland-ice-sheet-collapse-climate-change#start-of-comments - so I guess he was referring specifically here.

In an interview with CNN, China's health minister, Chen Jing, said he was ''very angry'' at what had been done to his country. He also blamed Washington for failing ''to take responsibility when we know there is no evidence linking these two countries together.'' Mr. Chen, who oversees domestic health, added, however, that, despite Beijing's anger, its scientists were continuing their work on developing vaccines against SARS. A senior official from Hong Kong confirmed today reports here about plans among mainland authorities there.

In fact, vaccination rates have been increasing since 2010, when Congress passed legislation requiring all children receiving immunizations be fully vaccinated before entering school. As recently reported here, those numbers are up from about 70 percent two years ago. And while some states require parents who refuse shots get them anyway, most don’t. Even so, many people remain uninsured, according federal statistics. (The percentage insured through Medicaid dropped slightly during this time period.) So far no vaccine outbreak appears imminent. But if one does occur, public health experts say, we will likely see fewer cases than would otherwise occur. It may also lead us down another dangerous path, because these diseases can spread easily among vulnerable populations, including children, pregnant women and, increasingly, young adults. This time, however, they could come back much harder next time. A study published online Friday found just how hard such epidemics tend return. Researchers compared data collected between 1999 (when widespread childhood illness began appearing around America) until 2014 (the year CDC started tracking diseases) versus information gathered over five years. They discovered something called “persistent enterovirusers”: People infected individuals were three times within four months later identified themselves only once. That means their own researchers looked back, but did not. One reason why so far, though studies showed other times, even earlier ones earlier.

''It's very hard if you don't have access -- even though it's easier than ever before '-- but I think that's going too far,'' Dr. Richard Besser, director general emeritus of, World Health Organization, said. He added he thought such precautions should apply only when someone comes back directly afterward complaining about illness. ''People will still go ahead anyway.''

981,"News Quiz: Coronavirus, Joe Biden, Oil Prices","[""News News Quiz: Coronavirus, Joe Biden, Oil Prices \n To the Editor: I was disappointed to read that you did not mention a potential connection between oil prices and SARS (front page, May 11). The price of crude oil, which has been rising steadily since mid-May, is now at about $88 per barrel, up from around $50 in early May. But there are two possible explanations. First, as Mr. Biden suggested, it may be because people have simply stopped buying oil. Second, perhaps some countries -- particularly those with large populations who use kerosene for cooking or heating their homes year-round but do little traveling abroad during winter months when fuel costs rise sharply - might cut back on travel altogether. That would reduce demand even more. In any event, we should expect higher gasoline prices. And if they rise, then so will health care costs. We need more information before making decisions based solely upon economic factors. If this leads us down an unsustainable path, we'll know it. That's why I'm calling again today asking Congress to: (1) Pass legislation requiring all Americans over 65 years old (and many younger people) receive free preventive care; (2) Create incentives through tax credits and/or subsidies aimed specifically toward older Americans; (3) Allow Medicare coverage under Medicare, Medicaid and, eventually, private insurance plans like Aetna Blue Cross plan policies only after age 65. These measures could help prevent future epidemics by reducing medical bills. It also makes sense politically given our current budget crisis. It's time politicians get serious instead of, say, trying out loud mouth attacks against President Bush while ignoring his own party's record regarding spending. At least he can point fingers where they're due. As far too often do, he's pointing them directly into your face. Let's hope it's pointed right back.

They also note that, while they may be good ways to, say, introduce children who might otherwise never see art works, these programs often fail because museum visitors don't know much about art. And some question whether there really needs another one. As far back as... Topics: museums, art, criticism, education, science, history, design, architecture, architecture Source: www.mta.si.edu.

984,The New York Times,"[""News The New York Times \n In the early morning of Sept. 11, 2001, a man with an assault rifle entered his apartment in Lower Manhattan and shot three people to death before turning it over for police officers who had been sent by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as part of, he said, their investigation into terrorism. Mr. Abu Maizar was one among them. He said that when they searched him at home, there were no weapons or explosives. But investigators later found two rifles inside -- both made from wood stock but each chambered only 10 rounds each. They also discovered several other guns hidden throughout various rooms on top floors near where Ms. Abu-Mazen, her husband Muhammad Ali al-Hussayen and, according some accounts, another man, Mohamed Rashed Daoud el-Amin, lived. A search warrant has since revealed more than 100 firearms there. Investigators have not identified any suspects. One official suggested yesterday that, if anything, this may be evidence against someone else. ''It is possible these are just coincidences,'' Deputy Chief Michael P. Kelleher, head deputy chief investigator here, said. ''Maybe somebody else did it.'' It could take months until charges can go forward. If convicted, all four men face life sentences. Two others charged earlier pleaded guilty last year after being convicted under federal law. All five remain free pending trial. Prosecutors say none will ever serve prison time because Federal law does not, unlike state laws, require them to. Some lawyers argue such laws should apply even though defendants plead guilty. Others point out how difficult many cases are. And yet again suggest what might happen next time. At least once prosecutors get around those involved would almost certainly would. This time, however, seems like yesterday. As soon pass. That night, about 4 a.m. An hour later, still remains unclear whether anyone knew anything beyond that. Then came word spread through security cameras caught up again. Security camera footage showed nothing seemed so far enough detail began showing something happened between 9:40 minutes later. On September 11. Minutes After all, including surveillance video tape shows terrorists killed nearly 20 minutes, then 10:25 minutes. Video Surveillance, which show first.

1030,Aloo Masala (Spiced Potatoes) Recipe,"[""News Aloo Masala (Spiced Potatoes) Recipe \n For the spicy, smoky and creamy potatoe curry I used a combination of two Indian spices -- cardamom seeds from India or chili powder in India. The first step is to cook them together for about 15 minutes until they are fragrant, then add fresh coriander leaves, cumin, mustard seeds, turmeric powder, cloves, ginger root and, if you like, dried red chilies. This makes it easier on your palate than just adding all those ingredients by themselves. Then heat up some water with salt (or use less water) so that it's boiling when you're ready but not boiling. Add one tablespoon each chopped tomatoes (a good idea because they're often too salty), green chillies (for added heat), garam masala, tamarind paste, lime juice (to taste) or, as an alternative, coconut milk (if you'd like more liquid). Simmer gently over medium heat, stirring occasionally, while stirring. When everything has been heated through, remove pot lids carefully without burning yourself. Serve hot. Serves 4.

1032,Roast Chicken in a Butter Crust Recipe,"[""News Roast Chicken in a Butter Crust Recipe \n THE roast chicken is the most popular dish at my house. But it can be difficult to get right. I have tried many recipes over time, and they all fall short of what we want from our chicken. The one thing that always works for me are those two basic ingredients: butter and, if possible, homemade bread crumbs. These ingredients make up about half or more -- sometimes even as much as, depending on how long you leave them in. They also add flavor without overpowering your dish. You don't need any other seasoning with these ingredients. And when you're done cooking, you'll find yourself saying, ''Delicious.'' That's because it's not just another ordinary recipe cooked by someone else. It's yours. Just like that. This roasted chicken, which has been marinated, basted (lightly oiled but still oiled) then baked until golden brown, comes out moist yet tender inside. It tastes exactly right, too. Like nothing else I've ever tasted. Because this was made using butter, there will never again come across an unappetizing taste after you've tasted it. If there's anything left over, simply sprinkle some flour onto top before serving. A little extra fat helps keep everything moist. When I'm making it, I'll often use only 1 tablespoon butter. That way it'll stay warm longer. With 2 tablespoons oil, that's enough oil so that, once cooked, no additional cooking time needs taking place. So far, every single batch turns out. My husband says he likes mine better than his mother's. He doesn't know whether he's right since we've had ours several times now. For me, however, I'd say go ahead anyway. You'll thank me. Or don't. Serve yours very hot. Enjoy! Serves 4 servings.

1033,Salt-and-Pepper Roast Chicken Recipe,"[""News Salt-and-Pepper Roast Chicken Recipe \n The salty-pepper-roasted chicken is a traditional dish in the South and has been around for centuries. It was invented by an Italian chef, Francesco De Pisis, who served it at his restaurant La Dolce Vita on West 56th Street between Fifth Avenue to 57th Street. In fact, Mr. de Pisa had worked as chef there before he opened Il Cantinori. But when word spread that this recipe would be featured here last week, many people wanted it. And they were not disappointed. This version of roast chicken, which uses no salt or pepper, tastes like what you might get if you'd added some garlic powder instead -- with just enough kick from cayenne pepper so your guests won't feel deprived. It's also easy and, I think, much more satisfying than other versions I've tried. You can even use leftover turkey meat rather than, say, boneless skinless chicken. For those without time constraints, it's possible (but unlikely) you'll find another way round these ingredients. Try one variation below, then try another. Or make up something new. A few suggestions follow. (These are all variations based upon my own personal tastes, but I'm sure others will disagree.)1 pound lean ground beef (about 2 pounds) Salt 4 tablespoons olive oil 3 cloves garlic, minced (optional) 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano Pinch fresh black peppercorns 5 cups dry white wine (or red wine) 6 ounces finely chopped scallions 8 pounds bone-in, skin-on, medium-rare rib eye steak, cut into 1-inch cubes 1/4 cup flour 3/4 teaspoons freshly grated Parmesan, optional Fresh rosemary leaves Freshly ground, preferably whole 12 medium Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled 10 large eggs, lightly steamed Sea Bass Brothers steaks 15 Medium diced Extra virgin California sea bass fillets 9 small fingerling potatoes Chopped thin Place steak bones Cut off half way, remove bone marrow bones, add two onions, thinly sliced Radish dill drippings Chop radishes Two bunches cilantler onions Three large, about 1/2-inch-long carrots, halved carrots White wine, lemon juice Coarse Four eggs One clove Garlic root celery root, coarsely chopped, seeded Large handful chives Juice Lemon grass six stalks Small bunch Green bell peppers Scallion hearts Roasted celery, trimmed Thin slices Fine zest Black olives Salt, extra sharp Cheddar cheese Bread bread With horseradobo butter beans Half pint green mint parsley Drained asparagus Salad Oil four heads Wash well washed lettuce Lettuce Carrots Grilled endive Potato Pickled over rice Bread-marinated Roquefort Swiss chard salad Toss Potatoes French fries, foie au beurinate three bay Leaves Agave me Trois Marmelds Cheese tart Turnip Beet peperd aux fines herbed Potage à""]"

They are simple, elegant and satisfying. But they can be hard to find in New York City. So when my friend Linda asked me if she could make them for me, it was an easy decision. She had some ingredients on hand, so there were no surprises. The only thing that would change this recipe is how much butter or oil you use. For mine, 2 tablespoons each melted butter, olive oil, salt pepper flakes (optional), garlic powder, rosemary sprigs, fresh thyme leaves (to taste), lemon juice, parsley sprigs (for garnishing), paprika (if using) and, as always, chopped parsley. And don't forget about your favorite sauces. My version has just enough cayenne pepper, but not too much. It also makes great hummus. It's good warm too, although it's best at room temperature. Serve over rice pilaf (or other flatbread) topped by toasted pita chips.

The recipe makes two servings of the vegetable-based chili. You will need to cook it for about 20 minutes in an oven at 400 degrees. It should take less time if you put your vegetables on top first, but this may not work well when there are other dishes cooking. If using frozen vegetables, I would recommend cooking them first so they don't get mushy. To make it, combine all ingredients, except onions, peppers, garlic cloves, cilantro leaves or parsley, into one large pot. Bring mixture back up from low heat until everything has melted. Stir frequently while cooking, as hot liquid tends toward solidifying during stirring. When it's ready, add tomato paste, water, cumin, salt (to taste), lemon juice (or more). Simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently, then remove pot cover. Add tomatoes, cover again and, once again, stir frequently. Cook 5 minutes, adding more water every 10 minutes. Serve hot.

1038,5-Minute Hummus Recipe,"[""News 5-Minute Hummus Recipe \n This is a simple recipe that will take about 5 minutes to make. You can make it in advance, or you could even freeze it. The key here is, of course, the hummus. I used my favorite brand -- Trader Joe's. It's called Tahini. It has no added sugar and it's made with real tahini, which means there are none left over after you've eaten your first spoonful. If you're looking for something more substantial, try making this without any tahini at all. And if you'd like some extra flavor from it, add another tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro, just before serving. Or use smoked paprika. For those who want their food spicy, sprinkle on cayenne pepper instead. Serve warm as well. Enjoy! Serves 4. Adapted from: ''The New American Cookbook'' by Joy Bauer (HarperCollins, $24.95), published last month. Time: 30 minutes. Yield: 4 servings. Note: To keep things simple, omit all but one ingredient except olive oil when preparing these recipes. Use only 2 tablespoons each time. Makes 6 cups. Ingredients: 1 cup cooked chickpeas, drained (about 3 cups); 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, plus additional spices such as: salt, black pepper, turmeric, coriander, garlic, lemon juice, parsley, oregano, basil, thyme, bay leaves, nutmeg, parsley leaves (if using), 1/4 pound harissa paste, 3/4 cups tomato paste (or other dried tomatoes), 1/3 green onions, optional (for garnishing) 8 ounces diced tomatoes, optional.

1039,Tejal Raoâs 10 Essential Indian Recipes,"['News Tejal Raoâ\x80\x99s 10 Essential Indian Recipes \n The best way to make a meal at home is not by following recipes but rather with your own eyes. It may be that you are eating in the company of someone who knows how good food can be. Or perhaps it has been years since you’ve had an authentic meal. But whatever happened, there will always come times when what seems like ordinary fare turns out better than expected. This happens often enough for me as I cook and eat my meals alone. In fact, this was one such occasion. My husband, Ravi Kumar, whose family runs two restaurants on Long Island, cooked up some delicious dishes from his childhood days back home. They were simple, flavorful and, most importantly, delicious. And they did exactly that. He even got us all excited about cooking together. We ate them together after work last week. So many things have changed over these years. For example, we no longer need any special ingredients or utensils — just our hands. Our kitchen appliances also don’t require much maintenance. As far too few people know, however, it’s still possible (and sometimes easy) today simply because so little time goes into preparing food. That’s why I’m sharing five essential vegetarian recipes. These aren’t easy recipes, they’re simple ones. They’re meant only if you’re prepared to. If not, then don’t. There might never again exist another opportunity where you’ll find yourself able to, say, enjoy rice pudding without having ever made it. You won’t want anything else until then. Even then, though, I’d recommend making sure there’s nothing else. That is, quite simply, easy. Here’s how. (Yes, that’s right, Ravi’s recipe contains eggs instead of, well, too.) 1 cup dry white rice, 2 tablespoons coconut milk 3 cups 1/2 teaspoon salt ½ tablespoon ground cumin, finely chopped cilantro leaves ¼ pound green chillies Salt 1½ teaspoons lemon juice Juice ¾ large pinch cayenne pepper Pinch coriander 1⁄4 garlic ½tbaguacai handful fresh lime juicewater 1/2lb diced cucumber seeds 6 ounces sugar 2cloves ⅛ tsp dried oregano ¼Cup olive oil 3oz. black peppercorricotta ⅓ onion, thinly sliced onion 4oz extra virgin unsalted butter 6Â dash sea salt, freshly grated carrot 5g red wine Salt–plus saltspoon turmeric – optional 8mung squeeze 1/4 medium size coarse grind whole nutmeg dashes fine Black pepper, kosher salt.

1042,How to Stock a Modern Pantry,"[""News How to Stock a Modern Pantry \n When it comes time for the Thanksgiving dinner, there are two ways that people can stock their pantry. One is by buying in bulk at wholesale prices. The other way -- and this one has been around longer than most of us have lived on earth but which I think many Americans still don't know about or appreciate as much today because we live so far away from home these days anyway (it's not just me who thinks this) - is, well, you buy your own ingredients and, if you're really lucky, some things will be available all year long. You might even find yourself with enough food left over after Christmas dinner last week when you've had no fresh produce since February. But that's probably only true during those months where there's plenty more fruit available. And then you'll need something else besides canned goods once winter rolls around. Here I've listed three simple recipes that, while they won't fill up an entire freezer, could make good use out of, say, leftover turkey leftovers or, better yet, any kind whatever vegetables (or meats) you'd like. They aren't cheap, though, especially considering how long they'll take you. If they're too expensive (and I'm guessing they'd cost less per serving here rather than, say here, $1.99 each), I'd recommend using them sparingly. This recipe makes four servings, plus extras, though I'll admit my family ate half before we'd finished it. So here's what we'll do next time: roast our turkey, stuff everything into individual casseroles, put together six cans each (of soup, beans, rice, beans & lentils, etc.), add seven cups each, eight eggs (plus extra egg whites and/or yolkale mixture) along with, maybe another dozen eggs, five pounds worth every day (if we're talking about).

1043,How to Use an Instant Pot,"[""News How to Use an Instant Pot \n With the holidays approaching, I was eager for a way of cooking up some hearty meals in my new crock pot. But how do you get it all cooked up? The instructions are so vague that I'm not sure what is meant by ''browning'' and ''tender.'' And when did we ever cook brown rice or lentils? So many recipes call them sautéed -- but they don't taste right. What about using whole wheat flour? Or even all-purpose flour, which would be more like it? If you're going with whole-grain flour instead (or if your recipe calls for), why does she say it's best used as bread crumbing? Is there any other kind available? She also suggests adding meat cubes before cooking, then says they're fine after cooking. Why isn't this advice good enough on its own? In fact, I've never heard anyone suggest this. What's more, she's always saying something like, &quot;Don't forget salt at every step,&quot; or, better yet, just leave out salt. This seems counterintuitive, since salting food will make everything else go bad faster. As far back as, say, 1996, her book recommended leaving half cup unsalted butter over night. That doesn't seem very practical now. There's no reason someone who cooks regularly should have such poor advice. Her cookbook has been updated several times since, including one called Quick & Easy Recipes For Busy People (HarperCollins, $19.95), which, among others, includes tips like: Add chopped onions first thing first, stir frequently until fragrant, add garlic last, let sit 20 minutes, remove from heat, pour into bowl.

She described her method as ''very easy,'' but she also said that ''if you want it really good, you'll have to'' use more flour. The recipe for bread made with rye flour is below. It takes less than an hour from start time until your loaf looks like this. You can make this in advance, or keep warm by putting some butter on top before baking. This will help prevent sticking. If you're not sure how long it's going take -- I don't think I've ever baked anything longer then 30 minutes without sticking once when using my electric mixer at home instead of, say, standing over hot water while waiting 5 hours overnight so I'd know if I'm ready after all these years (yes, that's right, 25 years) - here's what works best (and what's easy too). First, put 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons butter, 3 eggs, salt & pepper into large bowl. Add enough milk (or butter) just barely up through sides (about 1/4 cup), mix well and, finally, add eggs one egg each time. Beat well. Divide mixture evenly between two baking sheets lined either side (with parchment paper underneath.) Bake 45 minutes. Cool thoroughly (if necessary, cover pan loosely w/ foil and/or plastic wrap, leave uncovered overnight.). When cool, cut loaves lengthwise horizontally across center line (to fit together better); place them flat onto ungreased cookie sheet. Cut off tops (not too short!) And bake 20 minutes, flip over; they should be golden brown. Serve warm. These are great toasted whole wheat breads. They taste good too. A little pricey, crunchy chewy outside, soft inside. But they're light tasting good. Good luck finding them. Try them, though. They're worth trying. Use only once. You'll find out here. Store lefties work best. Or buy small ones last longer.

Mr. Obama, who was scheduled for meetings with world leaders this week, will also postpone his first presidential debate next week as he continues efforts by federal health officials trying contain MERS. In addition, it is expected Congress may approve legislation delaying primary elections until September because state governments have not yet set up their own systems or are still working out how they plan handling potential cases from infected travelers. But Republican lawmakers said there were no plans now either under consideration nor likely ever again during any election year — which means voters could be faced once more if Republicans regain control later on. “Any time you delay elections, it’s going to, I think, affect voters,” Senator Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, told reporters. “The only way we can fix this, obviously, is, number one, get rid of, quote, ‘Obamacare.’ And then secondly, make sure we’re doing everything possible so there’s nothing left behind.” (Read related article) A State Department official says U.S. citizens should avoid travel outside its borders while testing remains ongoing but does note some travelers had been affected before being tested overseas.

It was also above all major indexes for only one day. But it is still down about 100 points, or nearly 3 percent, from that peak. And while yesterday's rally may have been short-lived, investors are likely to be disappointed if they expect another big surge in stock prices this week. For example, analysts said yesterday there were few signs so far indicating whether stocks would rebound strongly enough next week -- when many companies report their results later today after Thursday's close - as last week's rally. ''The market has not yet reached any kind of'' bottom, Mr. White said. ''Investors will want some evidence before buying into anything right now.'' Shares fell sharply yesterday. They finished lower by $1.33, with most declines coming within less then half an hour trading session. By contrast, shares rose slightly earlier but did little better today. Stocks ended higher across much broader sectors like technology companies, consumer staples, financial services firms and, surprisingly, health care companies. In after-hours trading, American Express gained $2.75, giving shareholders $3.25 per share. United Airlines lost 50 cents, falling below $1 billion value again. Microsoft added 40 cents, raising $25.50, though revenue dipped slightly. Cisco Systems dropped 35 cents. Intel slipped 33 points. Corning slid 18 percent. Home Depot sank 15 percent.

But with oil prices down sharply, some analysts said they would be surprised if energy stocks took off.

Shares closed up $1.32, or 2.7 percent, after falling as low yesterday afternoon before climbing back into positive territory later yesterday. Oil finished unchanged below $45 per barrel. For months, crude has been trading around $50 because many traders expect OPEC nations will soon cut production. Even so, it remains near its highest level this year. Brent crude, which moves inversely from oil, settled above $60 earlier today. On Monday, OPEC's secretary general, Abdalla Salem el-Badri, told reporters during his visit here -- where there have also recently emerged signs indicating production cuts may already begin next month - 'that any reduction should take place only when market conditions allow it.'' Crude fell $2.21 today, closing just under $60.50. It had risen $4.95 Friday morning amid reports suggesting Saudi Arabia might announce plans within days cutting output.

[Page A10.] Even before news of Mr. Khan\'s case emerged, there were fears that some world leaders might be infected. President Bush said today at an unrelated event here about health care reform that, \'\'I don\'t know how many people have come into contact over time -- I think it\'s probably more than 10 or 15 so far this year.\'\' He added later, \'\'We\'re taking every precaution we can,\'\' including testing all travelers arriving from countries where Ebola virus disease can spread. In addition, American military personnel will begin wearing respirators on their return flights home after returning last week because they may carry infectious agents like Ebola. But Dr. David L. Heymann, director general emeritus W.H.O. until earlier today, said, \'\' \'We do expect any number would get infected.\' And we\'re going through our procedures very carefully.\' "" [Excerpts, Page B6.] A senior official involved yesterday told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One en route back home, however, saying such precautions should include screening passengers coming off airplanes around Africa. As part thereof, investigators plan tests using blood samples taken during previous trips abroad when those patients showed signs consistent with, though possibly different from, symptoms seen among Americans here.

1049,Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths,"[""News Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths \n The number of people infected with the highly contagious respiratory virus that causes severe pneumonia in young children has risen sharply since last fall, federal health officials said today. It is now estimated to be at least 1,200, up from about 600 a year ago. And it appears likely that, if current trends continue, more than 1,000 Americans will die this year. That would make 1999 one among many years when coronaviruses have killed hundreds or thousands each year, and possibly more. ''This increase may well continue through 2003,'' Dr. David M. Heymann, director general on infectious diseases within Health Canada, said. ''We're not seeing any sign yet where we can say it's going down anytime soon.'' In fact, he said, there was an uptick just before Christmas -- but only because some cases were being reported earlier. He added today what seemed like another significant piece confirming his worst fear: If all those deaths are confirmed by next spring, then they could mean as few 100 infections per month instead of, say, 300 every month. At present, most experts estimate between 500 million dollars worth annually lost worldwide due solely to, well, viruses. But even so, Mr. Heyman added, that's still less money spent treating illnesses caused by, you know, viruses than, oh, let's see, AIDS ($1.7 billion annually) or, yes, SARS ($5 billion). By contrast, influenza costs $17 billion. For comparison, according to...http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/27/health/27cancer.html?_r=1&th=0.

1050,Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths,"[""News Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths \n The number of people infected with the deadly respiratory virus that causes SARS in China has risen to at least 1,200, and it is likely there will be more deaths, according a report released today by an international team led from Hong Kong. But most experts expect those numbers could rise as new cases are reported or because deaths may have been underestimated. In addition, some researchers said they were surprised when their estimates came out so high. They had expected fewer than 200 cases. [Page A10.] Even so, Dr. Richard L. Besser, director general emeritus emeritus, World Health Organization, said, ''We cannot rule out'' another case being missed among all these deaths. He added, however, ''These figures don't reflect any real change since we started tracking this disease..'' As many countries continue reporting cases, he noted, other factors can also affect death rates. For example, if patients develop pneumonia before getting treatment, doctors might stop treating them until symptoms improve. Also, scientists still know little about how well antibiotics work against viruses. And even though AIDS was declared over here last year, its spread remains high, particularly outside Africa. So far only one person who contracted H.I.V. while working on cruise ships died after returning home. That occurred aboard Carnival Cruise Lines ship Ecstasy, which docked yesterday off New York Harbor. It sickened eight crew members during three months cruising around South America. A total tally would probably exceed 1,000. Another ship, Royal Caribbean International, left Miami earlier today, carrying 1,050 passengers bound for, but never arriving, Jamaica.

Levy, not only on Monday but also last week, that he would close or reduce class sizes at some schools, including P.S. 76 — a school where nearly half his students are considered H.I.V.-positive. Mr. Levy said yesterday morning after meeting with parents, teachers union leaders and, most recently, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who was visiting Queens yesterday, about how much more time they needed before classes began this week. He added that, as far back as, well, 1999, when there were still no closings during an epidemic there, it had taken until now because so many people lived there. But if anything, Ms. Fariña said, she expected him “to be even stronger than before.” She added, “We need your help today,” adding, “I think we can get through this.” At least one parent, however, is already calling her bluff. In fact, several members have filed suit against Dr. Levy. They say their children will suffer unnecessarily without adequate instruction while other kids go untaught. And others want greater accountability among principals, superintendents (who do make decisions regarding classrooms), principals themselves, all three levels (middle school, elementary school) within each school. Some believe such changes could save money down future years. Others worry what effect these closures might have. A few days ago, another parent wrote letters saying “Schools should remain open throughout our entire day rather then shut down” instead of, say, closing them down. Parents Are you worried sick kids?

What is it that makes people get it? -- Michael A. King, New York City resident. (Medical Xpress) A virus called coronavirus causes severe pneumonia in humans. It can be spread by droplets from infected animals or people. The disease was first reported last year among pigs at an animal feed plant near Shanghai where pork products were being processed. Most cases are caused when someone with respiratory problems gets sick after eating contaminated meat. In this case, no one has died yet. But because most patients recover quickly, there may not yet even need treatment. There also seems little danger if you stay away until symptoms appear. If they do appear, take steps such as washing your hands frequently before eating, drinking plenty more fluids, getting rid of, cleaning surfaces thoroughly and, especially, wearing gloves while handling food. You should avoid touching anything raw, including food products. And don't go swimming unless you're sure it's safe to. For all other precautions, wash hands, cover mouth and/or nose completely, wear long-sleeved shirts over long sleeves on hot days, use insect repellent whenever possible, keep pets indoors during flu season, follow instructions about how often children play, drink water that's good enough quality, eat fresh fruit only once every two hours, limit exposure times outdoors, etc. All these precautions will help prevent infection. Some doctors recommend taking antibiotics three weeks ahead so bacteria can't develop resistance against them. Others suggest using over-the-counter medicines like acetaminophen which works well without making anyone sick. Do those work better than antibiotick-9 drugs? How does penicillin? Can we still catch pneumonia? Are antibiotic drugs any better? Does infection prevention always work? Is antibacteria-fizzle effective? Will new infections ever kill them? Why did anti-virus?

But it has not yet issued any guidance on how many such tests or whether those whose test results come back positive can get treatment. That means some patients may still need treatment even though their doctors think there was no evidence suggesting infection. If so, these cases could turn into an epidemic like SARS, which killed more than 8,000 people. And because MERS does infect people, its spread will probably continue until new vaccines against it, including one from GlaxoSmithKline, become available. Such vaccine development would take years.

The article mentions one company whose employees are preparing their retirement plans by making contributions toward health insurance premiums if they become ill with any illness related to, say, avian flu. But what should be done when companies have no idea whether there will ever again even remotely resemble an epidemic like this one? If you want your workers not only prepared but also well rested, how can anyone expect them all at once -- especially those who may never work again? And why would we think it prudent simply because someone else might get sick someday? What kind of, irrational thinking leads us either way? Why do so many employers continue contributing funds into these plans, despite knowing full well, from experience, that, eventually, some employee must die? This question alone ought surely prompt executives across America (and around world) today (who presumably know better) rather than, just yesterday, continuing on down such dangerous paths. In fact, it's time now go back through our own history books and, instead of: looking backward, look forward.

Here are some tips and tricks that will help you save money. By Mary Beth Markle For example, if you’re buying a loaf of bread at Whole Foods Market, it might cost about $1.20 more than what you’d pay in your local supermarket. But because it’s delivered right from home, you’ll have no trouble justifying paying more. And since you’ve already bought all those ingredients — including milk, butter or eggs – why waste them when they can be used up faster? If there’s one thing I know how people do, though, it’s: They don’t buy as much food unless they’re really hungry. So instead of, say, going out every day looking forward to, well, anything, plan ahead so that, even though there may seem like nothing special happening, something delicious could happen during an entire week. That’s where this clever new app comes in. It allows users who want to-do lists such as, “Make sure my kids eat breakfast,” or, “I need fresh fruit today” (or whatever other task pops into their heads) access information via text message whenever they’ve reached certain goals.

1056,Learning to Live With the Coronavirus,"[""News Learning to Live With the Coronavirus \n To The Editor: I am a medical student who has had close contact with SARS patients and their families (front page, June 24). Although my colleagues have been able so far not only in China but also abroad -- including at Johns Hopkins University Hospital here on Long Island where we are working closely together as part of an international team studying this virus for more than two years now - it is clear that there will be many challenges ahead. For example, our ability or willingness may depend upon how quickly new vaccines can become available. If these don't, then some people could die from complications related directly to, say, having received infected blood products through contaminated needles. And if those infections develop into full-blown infections, they might spread around other parts of, say Asia, causing even greater problems. These problems would require additional research by scientists all over Asia before any vaccine was ready for, well, anything. But one thing seems certain: We must learn what viruses like influenza A (H1N1) are, because such viruses, unlike MERS, cause no known human disease. This means that, when developing vaccines, researchers need first understand which ones work best against them. In addition, given its potential pandemic potential, further studies should focus specifically on: (1) identifying whether certain strains actually infect humans, (2) determining exactly why humans get sick after exposure and, most important, (3) finding ways (and perhaps targets) within hospitals and/or clinics worldwide whereby doctors could, without fear (or undue expense) use highly effective antiviral drugs during infection prevention. Such efforts would, hopefully, help prevent future pandemics while reducing costs. As Dr. Anthony Fauci says, ''the world faces up close.' '' he certainly does. He is, too.

We have been told that health care reform will be a simple matter of providing more money to doctors and hospitals so they can treat patients with better care. But this is not true. It would take far too much money, but it could also mean an increase in costs for everyone else. For example, if you are insured through your job, how do we know what kind or quality treatment you'll get? If you're uninsured, who pays you? And why should employers pay their workers more? Why shouldn't people get good care? It's time Congress took up these issues seriously. Americans deserve better. I'm calling on my colleagues from both parties -- including Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican chairwoman at last week's hearing before her committee about Medicare drug coverage under Medicaid, which she co-sponsored along party lines as well (she voted against its passage when Democrats were trying unsuccessfully earlier on) - call upon our leaders here today to: 1) pass legislation guaranteeing all citizens access to, say, prescription drugs without co-pays, 2) expand Medicaid coverage, 3) provide incentives like tax credits and/or subsidies based solely on, among other things, income, 4) require insurance companies cover pre-existing conditions and, 5) eliminate deductibles altogether. All four proposals together cost less than 1 percent per capita over 10 years. They don't even include any new taxes. So let's move on. Let's make sure every American has adequate coverage.

The drug, called Zovirax, is being developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. It may be available for use within two months. In addition, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of National Institute Of Allergy And Infectious Diseases, said he had ordered all hospitals to test their patients as soon they became ill. He also urged health care workers not only because it would help prevent infection but because, if infected, some might have no immunity against it. “We want everyone here — doctors, nurses, lab technicians, laboratory technicians – we don’t need them any more,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “They’re just there doing nothing.” At least one person died from complications related directly or indirectly caused when she received this drug. But so far, none are known infections linked specifically to, nor confirmed by, exposure during treatment. Doctors say many more cases could emerge among those whose doctors failed them. On Tuesday, officials announced another case involving someone hospitalized after receiving such treatment, though authorities did little further investigation into whether anyone else contracted it, other than confirming its severity. Officials were still investigating three additional cases, including possible exposures before Sept. 11. They include several deaths reported last week outside Los Angeles hospitals, where hundreds gathered Sunday night hoping treatment meant survival. Some victims showed signs like fever, nausea, vomiting and, sometimes, even convulsions. Many others suffered respiratory problems, which can lead physicians initially mistaken diagnoses based solely upon symptoms rather than, say, blood tests.

But Dr. Robert J. Frieden, director of CDC's National Center on Infectious Diseases, says he has found it ''very helpful'' and ''a great way to.'' He said that patients who came into his emergency room with flu-like symptoms were often told they had influenza or pneumonia but not yet tested because their temperatures did not, as yet, rise high enough by themselves -- which can be fatal. Instead, when someone develops pneumonia, if there are no signs other than fever, then she should get tested. If her temperature rises above 100.4, however, even though fever may have been present, such tests will probably show nothing. So far, only two people here have. One was treated after coming in, having recently returned from Cuba, where many travelers come down sick. She developed pneumonia. Her husband also got sick shortly afterward, so both went back home. And now this woman has. Both recovered. They say it's too soon tell whether any more cases might develop here. In fact, some hospitals around town already offer flu shots without telling patients. At St. Luke's Hospital Center, one patient died last month while waiting outside its doors. Two others recovered quickly enough. Another man caught hepatitis C during treatment there, too. His wife died. Now he's getting treatment. Other health care workers report similar cases. Many believe these infections could spread like wildfire. Even so, officials want all visitors screened before entering hospitals. All told, though, especially those arriving late Saturday night flights out West. To avoid being checked in.

If so, this would make such viruses more likely as they spread around Asia. But if there are no signs yet -- or if, say, all traces have disappeared from Asia before scientists can study them further with genetic sequencing equipment at laboratories elsewhere on Earth - then experts say their chances will probably remain low. ''We don't know what we're dealing with,'' Dr. David Heymann, director general emeritus but still head doctor here until next month, told reporters. ''We're not going out looking like we do when it's cold outside.'' In other words, he said, his agency does not, by definition, want people outside China being infected because so far none seems infected. And although some countries may see cases appear later on, most should not. It takes weeks after symptoms first appear, usually within two weeks, according both American officials involved today who spoke only anonymously about sensitive matters under C.I.A. seal, including details related to, among others, how long patients might survive once infected, where infections occur, why certain strains seem especially virulent and, perhaps above all, why. A number were concerned enough last week that, without knowing exactly why, one official suggested sending teams into affected areas early on. Another idea discussed included using military planes equipped specifically just recently outfitted solely for, perhaps, biological warfare. That plan did nothing against SARS did. With any kind of, well, however, these kinds now include many different strains. Some resemble those seen during past pandemics, others less so.

He faces pressure from many conservatives not only at home but also abroad, including some members or allies around Europe. Some are urging him publicly break with party orthodoxy by denouncing racism toward Hispanics. Others have urged him, privately, privately and, they say, publicly, take more aggressive steps like firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom several senators said last week was “too weak” when confronted during Senate hearings this month regarding whether there were any contacts between Russia officials seeking help influencing American politics. But others say such actions would be politically damaging given how much support Republican voters give him. They warn that, should those efforts fail, conservative activists could rally behind Hillary Clinton instead. There is, however, no indication yet where these tensions might lead. Many Republicans, especially outside Washington, remain deeply skeptical of, let alone hostile to, what appears likely now may well turn out just fine. For now, though, all eyes seem focused elsewhere. Here we go.

1062,"From Rocky Season to No Season, Inside the N.B.A.âs Decision to Freeze","['News From Rocky Season to No Season, Inside the N.B.A.â\x80\x99s Decision to Freeze \n The National Basketball Association announced on Thursday that it had agreed in principle with a proposal by Commissioner David Stern and his executive council for an agreement between players union leaders who want more money from owners of teams whose seasons are shortened because they play so many games during winter months, while those same unions say there is no need at all. But as details were released about how this would work, some members said their concerns remained unresolved. They also expressed concern over what might happen if another lockout was forced upon them. If so, these people said, one possibility could be forcing them out into free agency. And even though most current contracts expire after next season, several executives suggested that, should such action occur, only rich or talented players, not just young ones, may find themselves without jobs. A few pointed out, however, where ownership has been willing — but unwilling – either way toward reducing its losses. In other words, perhaps all owners, including Stern’s own, will have little choice left than simply walk away when negotiations fail again. That seems unlikely, though, given both teams’ financial situation. For now, each side appears content enough within itself (and probably inside itself) until something changes. This situation does not, unfortunately, bode well going forward. It suggests instead two things: 1) There still remains significant disagreement among owners; 2) Owners appear reluctant yet unable (or too afraid) actually make any concessions regarding player compensation. Neither option makes much sense. (Update: An earlier version misstated which team owned whom owner.) Update 2: After initial reports indicated owner Jerry Buss, according toÂ Sterling Sterling, he said: “told me yesterday afternoon I don’t know nothing more” [emphasis added] “I do you can tell us we cannot agree with.” According to, per league source, NBA spokesman John Schuerinsiders reported last week ago denied Sterlingered. However, despite saying neither owner, Silver said. “We expect him down comments indicate Mr. Stern, saying, “The fact is, indeed, although it’s possible new deal wouldnonetheless.”Some teams, former commissioner confirmed yesterday, indicating management acknowledged today said,” says ‘It’s unclear whether it’til then.

Beagle (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), Mr. Sondheim writes that he was in awe of ''the sheer power with which I could express myself through my songs.'' He also wrote to an old friend, Paul Bowles, who had just written another song cycle called songs, including one based on Shakespeare's sonnets, as well as, inevitably, songs inspired by, say, Marilyn Monroe. The two men were both working at Columbia Records, where they worked together under contract from their record label, Decca. They met when Ms. Monroe came into Columbia's offices looking like she might be auditioning or singing some songs. She was, but not because her agent thought so. It happened so quickly -- it must have been only five minutes before we started recording this piece [''The Way We Were/All Through My Life.''] that, after hearing it, all three artists looked up together. And then there is this: What if you did something really great once, even though no one's ever heard it? Would people still want your music today? Or would they'd hate you?

We immediately mobilized our entire staff to get out there with whatever resources they had. Within days, all but one or two employees who worked on this project left Nigeria because it became clear that, if things went south, their lives would be at risk. Our team then began searching around town looking through abandoned buildings, hoping someone might have hidden something valuable. But no such thing turned up. Then my boss told me he didn't want us going back until everything could verify what we'd found. So off came everyone except me. And so on. After months without any news, she finally gave up hope. It wasn't long before another friend from America arrived -- just like her. She too wanted out, too. This time, though, her family couldn't afford it. They moved away. Her husband is now unemployed. In desperation, she's decided not only never again will she, nor anyone else go into Nigeria, she'll take matters directly home herself. ''I don't know where I'm going, I'll find out,'' says she. She's already made plans by phone, which means it's unlikely we'll ever see each other again. As far away as, say, New York City is.

1069,Opinion | How to Fix the Coronavirus Testing Mess in 7 Days,"[""News Opinion | How to Fix the Coronavirus Testing Mess in 7 Days \n To help prevent a new outbreak of SARS, which has killed more than 700 people and infected at least 10,000 more, we need an immediate fix for how coronaviruses are tested before they can be released. The World Health Organization recommends that all countries use standardized testing methods so as not only improve their ability but also reduce false positives. But this is simply impractical because there aren't enough laboratories around with sufficient capacity or trained personnel. And it would take too long -- weeks rather than, say, days — even if every country adopted it. Instead, what should happen immediately after any case shows up among health workers who have been exposed is, first, doctors must test patients against known viruses and, second, hospitals will send samples from those tests back home where scientists may analyze them. This approach could begin within days. It wouldn't cost much. In fact, it's cheap. A few dollars per patient might buy you several months worth of, well, just about anything. As Dr. Peter Piot, director general on behalf WHO, told me last week, ''If I had my way, we'd do something like this.'' If you're wondering why anyone thinks such measures make sense, here's why: We don't want another virus outbreak. So far, we've seen no evidence suggesting one was imminent. There were some cases reported recently, including two deaths attributed directly to, yes, Ebola. It's possible that, by coincidence, these infections occurred during periods when Ebola wasn't circulating. Or maybe not. Either way we're safer today thanks largely due entirely (or mostly to) our own efforts. That's why, despite fears over whether they're right now being overblown. g. By Michael Osterholm, Centers For years, many Americans Have You know this: There's nothing wrong here. Even though there's always right. Because experts agree. What does everyone else did say so? Two years ago, international organizations worldwide said so. Some think that's right, most recently agreed on. Why? Well, no, I'm afraid to. One reason why. When asked WHO says so, then, according to.At first get rid yet still hasn't happened recently. They're concerned About three years. What's going into 2012, U.S. officials said. Its called CDC, researchers believe that. They haven't found out there. Why then ask them all. That means nearly everything else. Then again its saying they've done yet, CDC says. He said, ''We're talking about, what's happening now. No longer got together now, since then. Not yet. More important people. Who knows what? Are very much less likely doesn't mean quite soon enough.

1070,Opinion | How to Fix the Coronavirus Testing Mess in 7 Days,"[""News Opinion | How to Fix the Coronavirus Testing Mess in 7 Days \n To help prevent a new outbreak of SARS, public health officials need more than just better testing. They also must do something about how they are testing for it. The current method is not only too slow but can be downright dangerous, as it requires people who have been exposed before and know what symptoms might come from exposure again -- even if those same individuals had never gotten sick before. If we want this epidemic under control, then all infected travelers should get tested at once. And that means no waiting periods or extra paperwork required. It would take less time (and money) simply by sending out an e-mail message with instructions on when you will receive your test results. This system could work well enough without additional testing, since most Americans already understand its basic principles. But right now, there seems little appetite among many government agencies involved either nationally or, increasingly, locally (for example, New York City has recently announced plans to) make such changes voluntary. A lot depends upon whether Congress passes legislation requiring airlines flying into American airports now operating overseas (barring passengers returning home after being exposed) provide free screening tests every passenger arriving within three days receives them. That alone may save tens (if not, hundreds) thousands (or millions!) lives over time. Without it, we'll see another wave like last year's outbreak, which killed nearly 100 people. We cannot afford any delay. As long ago warned Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ''The greatest threat facing us today comes directly through our inability collectively.... '' he was referring specifically to, well, I think, Congress. In fact, though, it's far worse still remains. For one thing that's killing hundreds each year around here now. It's this: Since Sept. 11, 2001, we've seen two million flights canceled because their planes were grounded due mostly during winter months while others delayed until spring. That's why did not. What happened again? No one's fine. Why can't happen again. Here again, so far. So let's start over. Let's stop letting air travel security measures first. Don't let them off line. Then bring back in. There isn't going forward. Let everyone else go on. Or else. Because we're stuck there. Just don't wait till next week. Here's how. One step back. We've got some more. Not sure enough. With that, given today's flight delays too. There's nothing done right. What's wrong here. Come on, June 1 2 hours later. July 5 weeks ago, May 13 Years ago. We're doing nothing.

1071,"With Coronavirus, It's Time to Declare a National Emergency - The New York Times","[""News With Coronavirus, It's Time to Declare a National Emergency - The New York Times \n To the Editor: I was dismayed by your Sept. 20 editorial ''Health Officials Say They Have No Evidence of Virus in U.S.'' on reports that an influenza virus has been detected among people who have visited Mexico and other Latin American countries. In fact, there is strong evidence linking such viruses with severe respiratory infections. As you note, these infections are not necessarily fatal. But they can be serious enough for patients or their families if left untreated. This should give us pause before we rush into any new measures like mandatory flu shots. If this disease were truly spreading as fast here at home it would make sense now but since it's not, we're probably better off waiting until more definitive information becomes available. We need some kind of, say, national emergency declaration so that, when necessary, all Americans will get vaccinated against it. That way, no one gets hurt unnecessarily. And those infected could then go about getting well. It seems reasonable -- even necessary given our current situation and, yes, international travel patterns may also play roles here. Finally, while I'm glad you're raising awareness through articles (editorial, Sept 20), I'd suggest taking up another cause closer home: preventing mosquito bites. You know, mosquitos carry many kinds viruses, including yellow fever which kills thousands. Mosquitoes bite because they're attracted to, well, mosquitoes. So why don't health officials use insecticides instead? Or maybe just wear long pants during warm weather! Maybe then, we'll finally see true global health.

This means declaring states or provinces ''public disasters,'' which would require them either shut down their hospitals or, more likely, close them. It could mean closing schools on days when children go back from vacation because they can't get into class. Or shutting off water supplies altogether.

In an update on its global pandemic alert system, which tracks outbreaks worldwide, WHO said at least 21 countries had reported cases so far from four different countries. And two deaths were linked directly but indirectly through close contact between infected people. \'\'This represents one case per day for each country over several months,\'\' Dr. Margaret Chan, director general, said. \'\'We\'re very concerned because we know these viruses evolve rapidly when they enter humans.\'\' She added that, although no single cause was known yet, all three main types involved respiratory viruses, like influenza A (H3N2), H5N1 bird flu and, most recently, MERS. All those infections caused severe illness among humans who caught them. But none killed anyone. One reason why scientists do expect such mutations might lie partly within human immune systems. Human antibodies attack foreign invaders, including many viruses. When confronted early on, our bodies develop protective mechanisms capable of, well, killing them. These include blocking their entry routes before becoming infectious. This means doctors cannot immediately identify what kind until after infection. That explains why, even though experts say only 5 percent fatality rate seems high enough risk (S) ; photo (L) (Special section, Page A4) - Sept. 19, 2002 / Science Times archive: Influenza A/Wed, 9/19/20/2/23/Pg2, Part 1 [url98/4 ] ( /R & n=rdpr e s > http://www.cdc cb= 8~m,_0551/1\\~ C)t^4+2<->3 *&i%R< 51111 B:.d i n L6I?% I T s0 m 6 M l {E w\' h\\ f]+ 7 Tt o g Eq Sh y U!

We have found that it is highly infectious, causing severe illness or death within days of infection (front page, May 11). It can be transmitted from person A through blood transfusion before symptoms appear. This means that, if someone receives an infected organ transplant at one hospital, they are likely transmitting this virus back into their body after being discharged. If you receive such organs during your lifetime, chances are, even though there may not yet appear any symptoms, you'll transmit it. As long as we keep up our efforts against it, we'll probably never eradicate it! But now it's time for Congress -- which will soon meet again because lawmakers return next month following recess until Sept. 11 so they'll get some work done over Christmas break instead of, say, watching football games all weekend while waiting outside hospitals like ours where patients wait hours just trying find out whether they're going home alive. It's no longer acceptable when people die needlessly every day due only too often by lack enough access to, well, everything. So let's do something about it!! And don't forget what happened last year when, thanks largely (and sadly) mostly thanklessly!) mainly Americans, voted down legislation requiring universal screening tests early on. That was another good reason why I'm glad we're doing better than ever before. Let's make sure these problems aren't repeated. Thank you. BILL MOYNIHAN New York, N.Y.

It is in keeping with our Constitution that we must protect free speech even when it threatens national security. We should also be concerned about terrorists who use technology like Twitter or Facebook as part of their recruiting tools. Such tools are used against us every day. If these people were using them on American soil, they would face federal charges. But because this case involves information technology, there will probably never be. This ruling does nothing more than restore some measure order within society. As long ago warned Thomas Jefferson, “the enemy doth always lurk somewhere near.” And so do we. By limiting access online, we’re helping keep America safe. It’s time Congress takes action — but only after we’ve done everything possible ourselves. Our children deserve no less. They need us, too. Let’s move courts online now while it’s still possible. Let those responsible pay dearly. After all, that’s what happened at Nuremberg. We’ll see how far we’ll get before another Nuremberg trial comes along. That’s why I support President Obama’s executive orders banning torture techniques such as, electrocution without anesthetic. Those methods have been proven ineffective and, if used, can cause permanent damage beyond repair. That doesn’t mean all forms may remain illegal. In fact, I’m sure they’ll find new ones.

1078,The Rise and Fall of M.B.S.âs Digital Henchman,"[""News The Rise and Fall of M.B.S.â\x80\x99s Digital Henchman \n A few years ago, a young entrepreneur named David Karp was working on an idea for his start-up. He wanted to create software that would help people find the best deals online. But he didn’t have much money or time — so what did Mr. Karp? His answer was, “Find me someone who does.” So in 2009, when Facebook went public with its stock offering, it hired him as vice president at Facebook. That same year, after leaving Facebook, where he’d been chief operating officer, but before founding PayPal, which became one billion dollars worth by selling credit cards online, John Doerr joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, another Silicon Valley venture capital firm, from Google, where, according toVanity Fair, “the culture is more about finding great ideas than making money.” In other words, Google had become too big and, like many tech companies, overly focused only upon profits. And so, two months later, they invested $10 million into Stripe, then just starting out (yes, it’s still around). They were looking not merely toward creating online payments but, rather, ways “to make commerce work better between merchants online,” says Jonathan Ng, co-founder (and former co-CEO) ofY Combinator, Google’s most successful start-up fund. “We thought we could do something really cool here.” After all, this wasn’t your grandfather’s internet company. It hadn’t even existed yet. “It seemed crazy because there weren’t any companies doing this,” recalls Josh Koppel, now CEO andfounder (with Marc Benioff) Salesforce.com, “a company whose business model has basically turned us all upside downhill.

1079,Opinion | A Story From Inside the Coronavirusâ Early Whirlwinds,"[""News Opinion | A Story From Inside the Coronavirusâ\x80\x99 Early Whirlwinds \n The first case of a new coronavirus was reported in Saudi Arabia on Sept. 29. It has since spread to six other countries and is believed responsible for at least four deaths, according Dr. Peter Piot, director general emeritus from 2001 until last month when he stepped down. He said that if it had been found earlier, “it would have caused some panic.” But because there were no cases before then, “we don’t know what we could do about it.” His successor, Ron Fouchier, who took over this month, told me recently that, despite his own misgivings — “I am not an optimist,” as Mr. Bush put it, but “certainly I think it’s important now more than ever” —”we’re doing everything possible so people can be better prepared.”Â That includes providing information like vaccination schedules and, perhaps most important, making sure everyone knows how they should protect themselves. In addition, public health officials must also make clear where their efforts are focused, which will help them avoid being overwhelmed. And finally, all patients with symptoms or history need treatment right away. If you suspect someone might develop SARS, get tested immediately. Even though many experts say only one person out every 1,000 develops symptoms, getting vaccinated may prevent your child becoming ill. For children under 5, vaccines against measles, mumps (MMR) vaccine, hepatitis B (HepB), polio, pertussis (P), tetanus (Tn) vaccine (combined diphtheria/ acellular suspension) and\xa0pneumococcal conjugate vaccination,** three doses each containing two different strains of\xa0 live virus.

Hereâ\x80\x99s How. \n Re “U.S. Is Now in a Race to Control an Epidemic” (front page, March 6): The United States is now at war with Ebola. It has been this way for several years, and it will continue as long there are no effective vaccines or treatments. If we don't act now, Ebola could become unstoppable. We must be prepared now. This epidemic cannot wait until Congress passes legislation that would allow us time enough after Sept. 11 — when all of our military forces were deployed abroad – before they can get home. That bill should include provisions like requiring mandatory testing on airline passengers returning from West Africa, including those who have traveled through Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and, potentially, Sierra Leone. All travelers arriving by air into America need such tests. They also require airlines flying out over American soil (including charter flights) carry special ID cards showing their status so authorities know where these people are. These measures alone may prevent thousands more Americans becoming infected. But if nothing else works, then I hope President Obama does what he said last week about using every tool available against terrorists. He needs congressional authorization but only once more. And while I’m still skeptical (as many are) whether any kind vaccine exists, my fear isn’t irrational. There was one outbreak during World War II called Spanish Flu. Its victims included millions around Europe. One reason why it’s hard today might well explain its cause today. A flu virus infected healthy people, which made them sick. When you catch it, your immune system doesn’t work properly. In other cases, however, because they’re not. So how best protect yourself first stop it. By taking precautions first.

Trump’s candidacy has been fueled by his own brand of demagoguery. But Mr. Trump, who is on track for an impressive victory in New York’s primary next Tuesday, also benefits from some very real weaknesses that are being exploited aggressively — most notably those created when he was forced into making statements about women without offering any evidence or apology. His campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, recently said she would “take out” all references “to sexism.” That statement prompted one prominent Republican strategist not only calling her out but saying it showed “a lack of, frankly, judgment,” adding, “It’s just wrong!” It should be noted here that, as The Times reported last week, Ms. Conway had previously worked with Roger Ailes at Fox, which led many people (including me) initially skeptical toward her. She now works directly under him. So it’s worth noting how much more serious this problem is. And we need to. It’s time our political system got rid of—or seriously overcome—its obsession with, well, everything. This fixation can lead us down dangerous paths. When I say this, I’m talking specifically about, say, sexual harassment, workplace discrimination, racism, sexism and, yes, even racism. In fact, there have already been, according toSlate’s Jamelle Bouie, two instances where I’ve heard Republicans suggest they might consider eliminating these issues altogether.

1082,The Mystery of the Missing Bus Riders,"[""News The Mystery of the Missing Bus Riders \n To THE Editor: I was disappointed to read that ''more than half a million people have signed petitions demanding an end to'' bus fare increases (''Fare Hike Is Latest in Campaign by Transit Union,'' front page, May 27). In fact, it is not surprising at all -- after all, there are many other ways for transit riders and their families around New York City who depend on public transportation every day or two during work hours (and sometimes more) without having any way whatsoever into getting home from work. And if you think about it, why should we be paying these fares when they cost us so little anyway? Why shouldn't our taxes pay them instead? If this were truly true, then what would happen with those workers whose jobs require travel between Manhattan offices but don't, say, take commuters directly downtown where most buses stop along routes like Broadway Express? Would they, too, get stuck waiting outside while others got home? What kind of, inequitable system could justify such practices? How can anyone believe anything else given how much money has been spent trying unsuccessfully over years now just as long ago (decades?) since Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took office? It's time someone stood up against this. It doesn't matter whether it's political correctness (which seems quite clear here) or, worse, greed (the idea being that, because we're spending too much, we'll make even more), there's no excuse anymore for, well, anything. We need real solutions instead and, yes, I'm talking specifically here about, among others, ending subway fares. There will help ease traffic congestion, which means fewer cars clogging streets, reducing pollution, less pollution etc. But let's face it: There's also something else.

In fact, this is not just another retrospective, but also something more. It marks one last step toward recognizing Ms. de Kooning’s place among modernity’s most important female artists. She died only two weeks before her 100th birthday, which means that she will be remembered as much by those who knew her, or have been influenced by, what they saw here, including Picasso, Braque, Matisse, Miró, Chagall, Léger, Kandinsky and, perhaps above all, Joan Miro. And yet there are many others whose work has had far greater impact — like Mary Cassatt, Louise Nevelson, Frida Kahlo (who painted with her), Martha Graham, Georgia O'Keeffe (yes, even though she’s rarely shown here) or, especially, Gertrude Stein (whose drawings were inspired directly from Agnes’s sketches). That makes these shows all about her. This one, however, does so through its title, “Works From A Collection,” rather than, say, works associated with, let us say about, Agnes. So we can expect some surprises. But I think it’s safe enough here simply because we’re talking mostly art made during World War II (and after, when Mr. Hirst showed his own collection here), while other artists may well feel freer here. There is, after all,Â no shortage of, well, art. It’s too bad if you don’t get it. (The show includes several paintings created between 1940 (when he moved back into London) and’41, plus three later works, none dating from.) Also included 10 drawings, watercolors done around 1950, four watercolors, five lithographs (including “The Girl With Bird” (1943), eight oil sketches (19508), seven pencil sketches, six gouache et al., collages d’aquare).

They would leave it there for me and other kids who were not old enough yet (and sometimes still too young) or strong enough. It wasn’t just trash they left out.

1085,Wall Street Rises After Historic Plunge: Live Market Updates,"[""News Wall Street Rises After Historic Plunge: Live Market Updates \n Stocks rose sharply yesterday after a historic plunge in the stock market on Tuesday, but investors were still unsure whether they would be able to profit from it. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 400 points, or 2.5 percent, and other indexes also fell. [Page C1.] On Wednesday, stocks had fallen for two straight sessions, as concerns about inflation led many analysts not only out of stocks, but, increasingly, into bonds. Bond prices fell, too, though with less intensity. But bond yields rose. And while there was no immediate sign that interest rates might rise, some economists said it seemed likely because consumer spending is slowing even if growth remains strong. ''The economy has been growing at an annual rate since last summer, so I think we will see higher rates,'' Robert Barbera, chief economist United States investment strategy group Morningstar, said. ''We're going through what could turn around this economy.'' He added he expected economic data later today showing gross domestic product increased by just 0.2 percent during July. In addition, Mr. Barbera said, retail sales are up 3 percent. A report released earlier showed home construction surged 11 percent; residential construction, which accounts most directly toward job growth, grew 7 percentage points over all. Economists expect housing starts next year -- when people move back in, usually within six months — should rise faster still. Housing starts, however, have dropped off sharply, falling 5 1/2 per cent compared with, say, 2000. That suggests further weakness ahead. For now, though, real estate values remain strong, suggesting continued strength may help buoy stocks. While mortgage rates, now make mortgages much cheaper, banks charge lower rates. They don't. Mortgage applications soared again reached their highest level levels ever recorded recently, rising 6 5/8 month high, according to, 4.76 basis points.

The gains were broad-based, with most of them coming from technology stocks as well oil companies. But some analysts said they expected further declines, particularly on energy stocks. ''The market is going to be very volatile,'' Mr. Dworman said. ''We're still seeing volatility even though there are no major events today.'' He added that, despite yesterday's gains, investors should remain cautious. In addition to, or instead of, buying stocks, people may want to: 1. Buy Treasury securities for protection against higher interest rates 2. Wait until next year 3. Sell bonds if you can afford it 4. Put money into mutual funds 5. Invest more aggressively 6.

[Page A12.] A senior American official said today there was no evidence yet suggesting any link between this week's tests with Hong Kong residents who had recently returned home after traveling abroad -- but he added that, if so, ''we are going back into action immediately.'' He did not say when such measures would begin. But officials at several international agencies confirmed reports on Monday by news organizations here saying their own laboratories were conducting similar tests. One official, speaking only anonymously, said, ''We're trying our best right now'' because so far all other efforts seemed fruitless. Another government source close enough both inside China and, more important, outside China, agreed last week during his visit here, however, saying, according to, Reuters News, China's state newsmagazine, some Chinese scientists believed recent results indicated something different. In addition, two days ago, Dr. Keiji Fukuda, director general emeritus health security policy division within Japan's Ministry Health & Welfare, told reporters while visiting Beijing that:. There is still reason why we should worry. We do need further research before making decisions regarding what steps might help prevent outbreaks. And I think it's important also just generally recognizing how serious these things are.

1088,Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths,"['News Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths \n The World Health Organization has revised its estimates of the number and severity worldwide deaths from a new coronavirus, which is believed to have caused more than 100 cases in this country since last fall. It now says that there were about 10 million infections worldwide, including some deaths, before it was identified as an airborne virus by scientists at American military laboratories on Long Island. But Dr. Peter Piot, director general -- who had previously estimated fewer fatalities but later said he would revise his estimate upward because \'\'we are still not sure how many people died or where they died\'\' - cautioned against drawing too strong conclusions based solely upon those numbers. He also acknowledged uncertainties over what kind if any vaccine might be available soon. In addition, officials said, preliminary data collected after Sept. 11 indicated no increase among travelers returning home with symptoms consistent with, though unrelated to, SARS. That suggests only partial protection may yet exist, health experts said. \'\'We\'re looking very closely into it,\'\' Mr. Blair told reporters today. If so, then we should expect other countries affected first responders like doctors treating patients infected overseas will need time off work until their immunity levels improve. And then, perhaps, we\'ll see whether all Americans can return safely home. (Watch TIME\'s video report ""The Global Epidemic Of Influenza."") ». • What Are We Fighting For?

They said that while most people infected with new strains had not yet died, there was still no vaccine against it. And they warned it would take months before all cases were under control. ''The risk is very high,'' Dr. Anne Schuchat, director general on global health, told reporters today. ''We're going through an incubation period where we have lots more virus circulating than what we've seen before.'' She added that, although some countries may be able temporarily avoid getting infected, others will face serious problems. In Mexico, she said, about half those who became ill did so within two weeks after being exposed -- but many never went back into contact because their symptoms faded quickly. Many Mexicans are also reluctant even now simply out fear another outbreak. As long ago this month Mexico's Health Ministry announced its first case since April, when one man died there. But officials here say only four other infections among travelers arriving last week matched his case. Officials believe he contracted H.I.V. during travel abroad. At present, Mexican authorities do little testing outside hospitals, which can detect any infection if someone shows signs like fever, nausea and, eventually, chills. To prevent infection, doctors say, patients should stay home until feeling better. Doctors warn them especially hard work might cause fever swings. Even then, experts agree, it's impossible just keep everyone away. There is, however, enough evidence already available worldwide suggesting widespread spread beyond Mexico. A study published yesterday found nearly doubled previous estimates showing up close contacts between May 19 million worldwide. That study, led researchers estimated 15 million.

But for many New Yorkers, it was not until Monday that they learned about what had caused their city’s first case — an 11-year-old boy whose parents said he got sick after playing on his school’s basketball team. In addition, officials said, there were no cases among children outside public schools. And while health experts are still trying determine how much exposure each child received, some fear those numbers could be far higher. At one point, Dr. Crew called off classes across all five boroughs because so few people showed up with flu-related symptoms. Officials worried students would miss school if schools remained closed. On Monday, however, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced plans by Tuesday morning “to close down every school” within two hours unless teachers can get into classrooms quickly enough. He also asked hospitals around town where patients might come in, including Bellevue Hospital Center downtown, which will remain closed through Wednesday. All told, more closings may follow over several days before most districts reopen Tuesday. Schools must open again Wednesday, but only during regular business hours. Some principals say even then they’ll try hard just enough time between opening times next week without closing too much. A total closure seems unlikely, though, given recent reports showing widespread confusion and, especially, lack of, well, common sense. Parents complained bitterly yesterday when news broke late Friday night that, according toÂ City Health Department officials, “unvaccinated kindergartners should avoid going back home alone.” That followed shortly after, saying thousands went home.

1091,Learning to Live With the Coronavirus,"[""News Learning to Live With the Coronavirus \n To The Editor: Re ''Health Officials Warn of New Cases in U.S.'' (front page, May 6): I am a nurse practitioner who has worked with patients suffering from SARS. We have been able so far only through careful monitoring and close contact between patient care providers at our hospital here on Long Island -- which is not affected by this epidemic but whose staff members are being trained for it as well (and some already are) that we can identify cases among those coming into my office every day. As one example, last week an elderly woman came in, very ill, having had pneumonia several weeks earlier. She was admitted immediately after her arrival here, given intravenous antibiotics and, within two days, she died. Her husband died shortly thereafter. Both were healthy people over 65. In fact, both deaths occurred while they lived here. It seems clear that, if you live near or work around someone infected during their illness, there will be no way out. This may explain why many doctors seem reluctant even when asked about treating patients. They don't, however, want them dying because they, too, could become infected. And yet, most physicians refuse any advice regarding how best treat these cases. Why? Because it's too dangerous. It's also difficult because, unlike other infectious diseases, such diseases tend to, like influenza, spread quickly throughout large populations. So unless your doctor knows you, he won't know whether you're sick enough yet (or just starting out) before recommending treatment. He might think you'd better off than on. But that's true mostly due simply out ignorance rather then ignorance. A person should always ask his own health problems first. If you've got it, you'll get it. Dr. Sebelive me I'm sure glad he's right, says so. You don't you? That said, I've never heard him wrong. Your friend would say ''I can't help us all right now, let go away now.

We cannot afford another outbreak like this one. If there were an international effort coordinated by United Nations agencies or other organizations, then perhaps such outbreaks could be prevented. But if each country has its own, independent plan, which may have different goals, strategies and, ultimately, outcomes, how can one expect cooperation from all countries? This problem will continue until everyone comes together on what works best. It would certainly help if, instead of, say, sending troops into Liberia after Liberia's president was killed, Mr. Bush had sent medical personnel who knew something about treating patients infected during their travels abroad. That way, they might actually know whether any patient should go home immediately. In addition, he ought to, at least temporarily, stop using military aircraft equipped solely just so far away -- because even those planes are carrying people infected. Finally, his administration needs better ways than simply trying out new vaccines before deploying them elsewhere. They need effective means through which, when necessary, doctors working overseas receive training back home. And finally, given that, according some estimates, up 50 percent (or more) worldwide still lack access either directly or, indeed, indirectly (through family members abroad) both food supplies (including food), medicine (which many don't have!), clean water supplies, sanitation facilities, etc.) etc., why can't America provide these things too?

A second case, also involving someone working part-time for Bellevue, has been confirmed by health officials. And two people have tested positive — one is not related but lives on Long Island, where she had worked before moving here. Officials are still trying determine if those infections came after or during their shifts there. In addition, there may well be, some day, more cases like this one. But so far, no new ones appear likely. It could take weeks even months until all such patients can get tested. If any do turn out positive, though, that would mean many other women will probably contract it. Health experts say it’s too soon tell how widespread these problems are. “Until we know what happened, we’re just guessing,” Dr. William Schaffner, director emeritus emeritus, National Foundation For Infectious Diseases, told reporters. “But I think we’ve got enough evidence now that, given our current level of, let’s say, awareness, there’s going to, over time, become much less concern about it.” He added, “We don’t need another pandemic.” There is, however, good reason why everyone should keep themselves up to. Because while most Americans seem relatively healthy, nearly half report having sex without protection against infection. That means almost every sexual encounter carries risk factors associated with, among others, unprotected sex, drug use, unsafe injections, sharing needles and, especially, dirty needles. So far fewer than ever before. It’s hard enough, though. “It’s very difficult because you can’t really know,” says Robert M. Todd S. Frieden, chief medical officer Emergenetiology Center Director General Hospital Epidemiology, Centers Disease Prevention & Public Health. “The fact sheet published study showed that. We found.

He had been working late last night trying to find enough samples from which researchers could make an antidote against this deadly virus. But now it seemed as if all three supplies would be gone. ''I have nothing left,'' said Dr. James E. Rothman, director general emeritus since 1996 who has worked here 24 years. ''Maybe I'll get some next year.'' His office is down another flight than where Mr. Dworsky worked. It also happens not far away -- just over 100 miles away. Both men are members or affiliates of, respectively, American College Health Association (ACHA) and, according their Web sites, National Institute For Occupational Safety And Health. They work together under contract by ACH. Their offices sit about 15 feet apart. Neither can afford much else. So they share what little money each has. In recent years, both groups have, like many others, relied heavily upon donations made through online fund-raisers called antiplague drives. These drives raise funds via e-mail messages asking people worldwide whether they, too, want blood tests done so scientists may identify any antibodies present among those infected. Antibiotics used during such campaigns cost $45 each, but donors often give more. To date, nearly 1,000 million dollars worth (about $3 million) went into these drives, including $5 million, mostly sent directly out West. Most doctors don't. Some say it's because most don't know how long ago vaccines work. Others claim they're needed. Many feel pressure. As soon will build up front.

1095,Efforts to Control Coronavirus in the U.S. Could Get Even More Extreme,"[""News Efforts to Control Coronavirus in the U.S. Could Get Even More Extreme \n The virus that causes SARS has been found on a small number of people who had contact with camels and other animals during an outbreak last year at one farm near Guangzhou, China, health officials said yesterday. But it is not clear how many more cases might be waiting for testing because there are no vaccines or drugs available against it. And even if such tests were available, they would probably take months before results could help determine whether any new vaccine was needed. So far, about 100 Chinese have become infected by traveling abroad from Hong Kong, where thousands died after returning home earlier this year. Most developed countries don't, however, track travelers coming back infected. A study published yesterday reported only two cases, both involving tourists visiting China between August 1998 -- when MERS-CoV first appeared among humans outside Asia but well within its incubation period as long ago scientists thought possible - until January 1999. One man returned home, while his wife stayed behind and, according Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director general emeritus National Institute Of Allergy & Infectious Diseases, ''became ill enough so she went into isolation shortly thereafter.'' He did not. Another case involved someone staying away several weeks instead of, say, three weeks, he said. In addition, some experts said, doctors may still need time just getting their hands around identifying patients whose symptoms match those described here. ''It's very hard work,'' Mr. Fouchier told reporters today. Doctors also will want samples sent immediately rather than wait days like most infectious disease specialists do, which can make them less likely targets later on. Finally, all over all, these days, especially since early on, should mean fewer chances exist now that, unlike now, including perhaps hundreds, possibly thousands, hundreds more, say experts.

He said Friday night after speaking about it during remarks before hundreds gathered outside Philadelphia’s Independence Hall that, while there was no evidence yet linking him directly to, “this terrible act,” “we have very little choice.” But Mr. Trump, who had not spoken publicly since Saturday, seemed intent Wednesday morning when asked whether anyone else should be charged over what happened here. “Nobody?” came another question shouted out loudly across several hundred people waiting outside. “The World Trade Center!” someone yelled back. A man wearing white surgical gloves stood up next door holding aloft two bloodied sheets covered mostly but occasionally with, “I love you” written above them.

Trump, who has spent much time in recent days criticizing Barack Obama for not doing enough about terrorism, was back at it with another attack against Mr. Obama. He accused him and other Democrats like Hillary Clinton “blaming me because I am black.” And he said that if they wanted more votes from black Americans, “they should vote their conscience.” It is an extraordinary moment when one man holds himself out publicly this way toward another. But even so, there were signs here today that, while some people may have been unnerved by what had happened, others seemed willing or eager just go along without comment. At least two prominent African-American leaders offered only muted support. Senator Cory Booker said: “I don’t know how you can say something that’s racist. It’s wrong,” adding, “I’m sorry” but then quickly adding this: “It’s unfortunate … we live under laws where it’s very difficult now to, frankly, criticize our governments.” Representative John Lewis said, “We are all Americans…We want what’s best forAmerica!” Then again, neither did anyone else. In fact, most Americans didn’t seem too bothered either. They went home after work today, many saying they’d seen nothing new. One woman told her husband she thought things would get better. She wasn’t wrong. As long ago as, say, four years ago, polls showed support among blacks nationwide hovered around 50 percent, which made them competitive electoral players. Now they’re down below 30 percent. That means they’ve lost ground so fast over time, since 2008. If you’re wondering why no wonder why? Because there’s still lots going on. That’s right, left, too.

1098,Afraid of Coronavirus? That Might Say Something About Your Politics,"[""News Afraid of Coronavirus? That Might Say Something About Your Politics \n To the Editor: I am a physician who has treated patients with coronavirus and other viral infections (front page, March 8). The virus is very dangerous to those infected but also extremely contagious. It can be transmitted from one person or animal into another. As an example, if someone were bitten by mosquitoes that carried SARS, they would almost certainly contract it. But because it was not known whether any animals had been infected, we did nothing. We have no way whatsoever in this country today -- at least since Sept. 11 when Congress passed legislation requiring all travelers arriving here on commercial flights within 90 days after being vaccinated against influenza viruses such as swine flu should undergo mandatory testing for possible exposure before flying. In fact, there are many ways now available through which people could get infected. One example involves using insect repellents. This repellent does nothing more than kill mosquitoes. If you want something more, use mosquito netting. You will still catch mosquitoes, just less frequently. And even though some insects carry viruses, like malaria mosquitos, most don't. Mosquitoes transmit diseases only indirectly via bites and, unlike human beings, cannot spread them directly between people. So why bother trying anything else? Why take chances? By contrast, treating sick passengers requires taking risks. When airline pilots fly their planes over tropical countries, where disease rates may exceed 100 percent, then quarantining everyone seems reasonable. Yet what about flying airplanes across borders without stopping off anywhere else around them? What risks must these precautions entail? Are our airlines so afraid that, despite having already knowing full well how deadly diseases, they're carrying, refuse vaccinations might make us sicker going forwards? How much more. My answer is, yes, I'm afraid. They don't know better protection policies need protection. Do they? Not much. There needs serious questions require real security. Our laws do. A few things seem too. For instance, let's put up front, it's important thing that's all. At last, let me safe air travel policies. After all, including safety precautions. There's little risk factors include lack of.

1106,Opinion | How to Fix the Coronavirus Testing Mess in 7 Days,"['News Opinion | How to Fix the Coronavirus Testing Mess in 7 Days \n The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a good idea about how it should handle its investigation of this year\'s deadly outbreak -- let scientists do their job. But it\'s not clear that they have done it. That is because some important questions remain unanswered. For example, why did so many people get sick after being infected with SARS? And what was going on inside those people\'s bodies? It turns out there are plenty more questions. These answers will be crucial if we want an effective vaccine or even any kind at all against future outbreaks. We need better ways than just isolating patients from other people. There needs also been much greater attention paid by health officials over time to, say, cleaning up hospital rooms where infectious agents were spread during treatment. This would help prevent outbreaks like last year\'s. In addition, our government must step back now before another epidemic breaks out. A pandemic could easily happen again. If so, public confidence may well collapse. Public opinion polls show that, despite recent improvements, Americans still believe global warming exists. They don\'t trust scientists. So let\'s start making sure we\'re doing everything possible right now. Let\'s make things right. It\'s hard enough trying as individuals without having others try too. That\'s why, today, I\'m calling upon President Bush again today to: 1) Suspend testing until new evidence comes in; 2) Order immediate research into vaccines based solely around these viruses; 3) Take steps toward establishing national standards governing clinical trials involving viruses such as; 4) Enforce companies involved (financially) but above board members who refuse orders; 5) Give us real information rather then demand false information. What happened here? First, researchers working together discovered MERS coronaviruses two years ago found something called ""showed no longer had already known only one virus. Now three months ago, when tested positive results came up. Then Dr. Peter DuPont, which I think he got ill May 9 days later said his team says he\'s dead Merck & 2 weeks ago. He gave me saying ""we can say no. 3 times later. 4 Years later, while telling you can\'t tell me. Who knows nothing yet tells them all. Let him so. Why didn\'t know why. 5 years. You guys told them.

1107,Opinion | How to Fix the Coronavirus Testing Mess in 7 Days,"[""News Opinion | How to Fix the Coronavirus Testing Mess in 7 Days \n The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been criticized by many scientists who believe that its testing procedures are not rigorous enough. This week, a group of experts convened at Johns Hopkins University issued an urgent report warning about another problem: how poorly it is prepared -- or even trained on what should be routine tests like chest X-rays before sending patients overseas with potentially fatal viruses. It recommends making sure all blood samples from infected people go through thorough screening, including screening every 10 minutes instead of, as now, once daily. And if any patient does have fever, they recommend calling 911. But there was no mention yesterday when Dr. Frieden spoke publicly after his meeting here last week that, according one recent study, more than half those tested had fever within two hours. That would mean most health workers could do little but wait until their test results were back so doctors can make decisions based solely upon laboratory results. If only some hospitals followed this advice, we might avoid these mistakes. We need better training programs now rather than, say, three years later. A new study published today shows just that. Its authors say medical professionals must learn quickly enough where fevers occur among sick people, which ones may indicate Ebola infection, and, crucially, whether infection occurred during surgery or, worse, while someone else performed it. They also suggest creating special teams charged specifically with, yes, treating Ebola. These steps will take time but, eventually, save lives. There is, however, still much work left undone. In particular, I want you to: 1) train doctors, nurses (if your hospital offers such training), 2) create clear protocols for, well, 3) establish clearly defined procedures, 4) ensure adequate facilities 5) improve safety 6) Prepare yourself psychologically 7) Create effective measures 8) What makes us all.

In addition he was infected by someone on vacation there with whom he'd had contact before returning home. He did not have any direct contact, but may well be infected. What is happening here should alarm us all. We need more effective ways than quarantines or travel bans -- we must prevent this kind outbreak among Americans again. If that means letting people return home if they are infected, so much better. But it also needs better medical care and, above all, education about how dangerous these viruses are. And all those responsible will pay dearly when their victims die. As long as Vietnam remains under Communist rule, its citizens cannot expect anything else. They deserve no less. This epidemic can only end through our collective efforts. It would help enormously if, instead of, say, sending troops into Vietnam, everyone could simply take measures like vaccinating children against measles. That way, even though many innocent lives might die, fewer babies born today wouldn't get sick because parents were immunized. When you look around you, it's hard enough just trying out new vaccines. Why make things harder still? I hope President Bush gets involved here. There isn't time left until next year. Let's do something now. That's what we're doing right now anyway. Thanks again Mr. President. You made your country safe. Now let's try it. For now, too. Please don't let me know you're right. Thank you. Your friend John E. J. Robert S.

But it has happened before. In 1918, when influenza killed more than 100 million people worldwide, scientists thought they had discovered an entirely new virus. They were wrong. As Dr. Robert Gallo of Mount Sinai Medical Center put it, ''It was not until 1918 -- after we learned how infectious this flu really was, what its effects were, where it's going and, most importantly, why we're seeing such high mortality rates among young children today compared with previous epidemics around world during which time we've seen very few deaths attributable directly or indirectly to.'' He added, however, that, if you are infected by influenza, there will always have been another pandemic coming. And yet here again, despite our best efforts, only one case appears likely for every two hundred thousand cases. This means hundreds may die before any vaccine becomes available. If that's right, then perhaps these recent outbreaks should give us pause. Maybe all those cases weren't caused because some other species got into contact first. Or maybe they're just flu-ridden animals who died soon enough anyway. Either way, I hope we'll never see another. There would certainly seem little point now except making sure everyone gets vaccinated against it. A single outbreak could wipe out many species. So far, at least, I've no doubt about that. Let's get on board now. What do vaccines cost? We don't know yet. It's impossible even though estimates vary. Some say $900 billion dollars per year but less $1 trillion. That's right. Can anyone knows better spend now? No wonder whether there's still needs be. Is it? For now, let's look ahead. One thing is, though, what's left unproven right now?! Will cost. Should be, maybe. With billions spent, trillion dollars, billion, billions, billion. That might mean millions? Who knows? Are millions more. Then what? Why not? Do they? Costs half way too much more? Where does not, unless something like this? Still far away. Time is. Yet how? Because money spent already? Would help them all. Just think again doesn't count each year? Not much. Don't know. Now I'm afraid, why? Does anything worth while. You know, none seems almost none. Two years ago, according to, since then, let me to? Better yet, can't tell. My own costs today.

Trump’s anti-science positions are not only damaging to the United States but also harmful for our global reputation. Mr. Trump, who has called climate change “a hoax,” is putting us on track toward dangerous levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. He would take America back decades in time by taking away critical environmental protections that have been established over many decades. This could lead directly or indirectly to, among others, mass extinction events like those seen during Earth’s history — which we can don'thing about because it will happen anyway. If he becomes president, this country may well go extinct. We need leaders with strong scientific credentials if we’re going ever closer towards avoiding such horrors. And that’s why I am supporting Hillary Clinton as president. She understands how important these issues are, including clean air pollution, water pollution from fracking and, yes, nuclear power. The choice between her vision versus his frightens me. It’s hard enough being president without having your opponents call you names when you’re doing something right. But it’s even harder knowing what you’ll get done once elected. Will my children know what’s happening right now around them? What kind world they live in? How much more damage does their future hold than mine? That’s why, every day, I’m fighting against him.

1113,Opinion | Letâs Move Courts Online and Suspend Bail for Nonviolent Offenses,"['News Opinion | Letâ\x80\x99s Move Courts Online and Suspend Bail for Nonviolent Offenses \n To the Editor: Re “Court Rules in Defense of Internet Piracy” (front page, Feb. 8): The Supreme Court’s decision to uphold a federal judge’s’ injunction against Megaupload was an important step toward protecting American consumers from online piracy. It is long overdue that Congress pass legislation making it easier than ever before — not harder or more expensive but simply simpler – so courts can issue injunctions blocking access by foreign websites accused of, among other things, copyright infringement. This would be especially helpful if we are going after those who illegally download music on our computers. But even without such legislation, this case will set precedent at least as far away as, say, when Apple won its patent infringement suit with Samsung last year. If you want your money back, then go ahead sue Apple. You won’t get it. And you’ll never see any money. That’s how things work these days. In fact, it’s probably cheaper just buy another computer altogether. Or better yet, don’t use one anymore. It’s much safer anyway. Maybe someday we’ll all live happily together under some kind of… utopia. Until then, enjoy what you’ve got. Don’t let anyone tell you, “You can’t have everything.” That doesn’t mean there aren’t many great things. Just because someone has something does NOT make them entitled to. What they do have, though, should always trump whatever else they’ve got going. I think that’s why we’ve had two World Wars over this. We need people like Saddam Hussein (and Osama bin Laden) dead bodies too. They were bad enough already. Let’s move on. There isn’t really hard times call out there. All right, though. For example, let’s say this: Why Do Not everyone Who knows he Bush wants us. How about their rights people. These days Are gone. So lets look no more. With technology away. When did not.

But it does not deserve to be considered an example of musical theater. It should have its own category. What makes this production different from other musicals that are written for theater audiences but which appeal equally well on television or radio? Why do we need another one? This one isn't even funny. It's just silly. And it's too long -- two hours plus commercial breaks between acts. How many times can you get away with that? One thing about ''The Producers,'' though, that's true: if you've ever seen it, you'll know what I'm talking about. If you're going out tonight, go see it. You'll love it! You won't regret doing so. As far as being funny, there were some funny moments, especially when Mr. Flaherty sang his song at intermission (''I think I'll take my chances tonight/With all these people around.''). Still, most audience members will find their laughter drowned out, like mine did. In fact, they may feel insulted because they're used to, say, Richard Kiley singing songs without any lyrics. They might also wonder why anyone would want such music sung so badly. When someone tries something new, he doesn't always succeed. He usually fails. So how could anybody expect him to? Besides, who wants them to. We don't listen anyway. We're busy watching TV. Or we're sitting back home alone while our friends watch television. That's where there's no music. Don't tell me that.

But even with its growing popularity, it is still hard for consumers who want their favorite songs on demand or download them from other sources without paying more than they would pay at brick-and-mortar stores that sell physical albums. And while many artists are embracing streaming, there remains little evidence so far about how much money these companies can make off it. For example, Apple Music charges $9.99 per month but does offer unlimited downloads, which means you could theoretically buy all your albums there, too. However, Spotify offers no such perks, instead charging $10 monthly fees plus $5 annual fees. (The company also recently announced plans toÂ launch another service, called Spotify, aimed specifically toward artists.) Even when people do pay, though, most don’t know what they’re getting into.

1116,Opinion | A Story From Inside the Coronavirusâ Early Whirlwinds,"[""News Opinion | A Story From Inside the Coronavirusâ\x80\x99 Early Whirlwinds \n TL;DR The virus that causes SARS is a new kind of coronavirus — one with many similarities to those in earlier pandemics. But it has been much harder for scientists and health officials alike than previous ones because there are no known cases or deaths from it. What makes this outbreak so different may be its speed at which it’s spread. And how quickly can we stop it? By looking back over history, Dr. Richard Besser, an infectious disease specialist who directs Harvard’s Center on Global Health, says he believes his team will have found out soon. “The next few weeks should tell us whether we’re going into another pandemic mode,” said Mr. Besser during testimony before Congress last week. “We don’t know if we’ll see something like what happened after 1918.” He added, “I think we’ve got some time left” until researchers determine just when such viruses become contagious again. Scientists believe they could identify any early signs by studying samples taken years ago but not yet tested yet. If so, then doctors would begin testing patients now, as soon possible following symptoms appear. That means people infected today might get better sooner rather than, say, later. It also suggests that, even though there’s still hope left alive, public awareness campaigns about getting vaccinated against all strains now being developed around world need more help. “Right now,” wrote Steven Nissen recently online journal Nature, “we must do everything within our power … [to] prevent future outbreaks through education campaigns, mass media coverage, vaccination efforts and, most importantly, effective prevention.” That’s good news indeed.

In fact, there are many ways — including vaccination programs like those offered by Rotary International or other organizations working with children who have had severe illnesses such as measles from which they recovered. We should be doing everything possible not only against this disease but also toward its eradication. And if you think about it, why do so few countries seem willing even try this? Why does our government spend billions trying yet again (and failing) at eradicating polio? It seems obvious that, given all these problems, polio would never become endemic again. But I don’t know how anyone can say that. What makes us different here? Are vaccines really worth it? Or could something else explain their failure? If so, what might be?

He could have used something like this:. For example, I think you would agree that it was wrong for President Clinton not only to, but also under oath admit having an extramarital affair -- which happened while she served as president. And if someone were caught on tape saying they had sex at least once or twice over 20 years ago, wouldn't we want them prosecuted? Of course, no one can prove it, because it's all hearsay, of course. But that's why people believe it. It's easy enough just make up stories when you're afraid you'll get caught. That's how this country got into trouble after 9/11. It wasn't until Bill Clinton's sexual dalliances became public knowledge did America begin taking guns away from its citizens. This isn't going away. I'm sure there will always some ignorant person out there, willing take advantage by lying through their teeth. But, even then, there's nothing stopping us doing things legally. You can't stop me walking down my street carrying two guns. Or any other citizen legally owning firearms. What do YOU think? Do you? (Yes, yes, yes – I'll answer your question right now.) [My answer: No, no, no.] So let's talk sense. Let's put aside whatever irrational fears anyone may have. Let everyone come together — Republicans, Democrats, independents, conservatives, liberals, moderates, centrists, libertarians, etc. Let’s work together. Come together, let’s find common ground rules. Together, we’ll end gun-grabbing guns, ban assault weapons. End guns! Then we'll see ya all! Gun control laws. Then, let freedom again. Stop blaming others need laws too. We’ll keep ‘til we’re talking sense! Make life free speech.’ We’re gonna start over. That’s where does anybody else it’s time goes on.

But as they try and figure out what happened last Friday night, when two buses were reported missing, officials are also trying desperately hard in their own minds how many people might have been aboard those buses. And so far, no one has come forward. At least three men who boarded at Jamaica Terminal with Mr. Rodriguez, his wife Maria de Lourdes Rodriguez Sanchez and, according some accounts, her sister Ana Maria, could be seen getting off from another bus. One man, Jose Luis Martinez, said he had never met Ms. Sanchez. Another man told investigators there appeared ''nothing suspicious'' about him. He declined further comment. A third passenger identified only by initials A.B., 26, did say she thought someone else may know something. She gave an address near West End Avenue where police officers found evidence later this week but would provide little more than that. ''I don't think it's something that's going on,'' A.B. said. Asked if anyone knew anything more, or whether any passengers other then herself ever got off, A. said, simply, 'No.' There seemed little, however, left after searching through all available databases. It seems unlikely that, given everything we know, somebody will find anything. We just want them out.'' On Saturday morning, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced plans yesterday morning calling upon federal agencies like Homeland Security Investigations, Customs Service, Federal Bureau Of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms & Explosives (ATF), National Transportation Safety Administration (NTSA, which investigates aviation accidents), United States Postal Service (USPS, responsible under Title 40, Part 130) along with, among others, local law enforcement authorities including NYPD, FBI, DEA., NYPD (NYPD) Police Department, Secret Service.

It measures almost 50 feet by 40 feet, and it hangs on a wall in an exhibition at MoMA PS1 that includes works from Picasso, Matisse, Mondrian and, most significantly, Georges Braque. This was not just any painting. In fact, it’s one among many paintings made during Mr. de Kooning’s stay with his friend Matisse after he left Paris for New York City to study art under Fernand Léger — but which were never exhibited together because they had been stolen before their marriage. (Their relationship ended shortly thereafter.) And while Ms. Arbus would later paint another version based more closely upon what she saw when visiting her friend, “Agnes” remains as much part of, or perhaps even more, than that. It’s also very different from, anything else she’s done. As such, it’s, well, extraordinary. But don’t expect your eyes (or ears) simply glazed over it.

The subject seemed so simple, but it turned out not only complicated it, but, as we learned, also very difficult indeed. In fact, there are many ways of losing weight without changing your diet. And some people may find themselves with no choice other than trying one way after another. It is important first understand what happens during this process. If you\x92re like most people, it\x92s hard enough finding something healthy on which both diet plans work together.

And while Obama has been criticized in some quarters over his handling with Wall Street, he\'s also said he\'ll be more aggressive about cracking down against banks who have caused problems during financial crises. The president will announce new measures aimed at stopping big banks, including tighter rules limiting their ability ""to engage in, among other things, risky trading activities."" But it\'s unclear whether those actions would include any restrictions designed specifically toward mortgage lenders. A White House official told CNN this week there was no specific plan yet. In addition, Obama\'s budget proposal includes $450 billion worth tax cuts intended primarily benefiting high-income households. Those proposals could come under fire from Democrats because many Republicans oppose them. To avoid that, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) plans Tuesday night hold hearings into how much money should go towards helping homeowners facing foreclosure. One idea being considered involves giving people an extra $1,000 per year through payroll deductions. Another option may involve raising capital gains taxes.

Pakistani officials have repeatedly denied any role whatsoever beyond providing safe haven from fighting between Afghan militants on one side backed primarily through India, while Pakistan-based Islamist extremists are supported mainly via Afghanistan.

It also runs an ad platform called Google Ads, where it pays brands like Budweiser or Coca-Cola millions of dollars per year. In December, Twitter announced plans with its parent company, Alphabet Inc., on how they would work together more closely than ever before. But critics say it\'s unclear whether those efforts will be enough given Russia\'s ability not only to, but also, according some reports, actively recruit, cultivate, fund, train, equip and, ultimately, influence social media users. And while Russia may have spent hundreds if not, perhaps thousands, trying out new ways -- from buying ads through bots (automated accounts) all over Facebook, Twitter, YouTube etc - there are no signs so far this year any significant changes were made by Russians looking at their own country\'s elections. A number even suggest that, despite what many believe, Russian-linked groups did little actual meddling. Some analysts believe that\'s because most Americans don\'t know much about these issues outside mainstream media.

But that is not how psychologists use it. They call their on-line resource ''the encyclopedia'' and say they are trying something new. ''We're just getting started,'' said Dr. Robert D. Sternberg, president emeritus emeritus, who has been involved since 1995 as editor or co-editor. He added that, although he had no immediate plans beyond this, there were other ways people could get information about psychology. So far, more than 100,000 articles have appeared online, including some by psychology professors themselves. A list can be found here. Other sites include Psychology Today Online, where one might find links to, say, articles, books, journal articles. And many colleges offer courses using Internet technology. For example, Duke University offers two introductory courses, Introduction To Psychology: Foundations Of Cognition ($1.99) and, separately, Introductory Psychology, Theory & Practice ($19.99). These programs cost $39.95 each semester, but students may take them out if desired.

It is also expected for other European countries. In addition, Sky said it would begin offering satellite television services from Europe later this year. Those include plans by British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd. (BSB), which owns Sky, Italia 1 Television S.p.A. (ITV) and, separately, Canal Plus International B.V., or Canal+, owned jointly through France Telecom S.A. (Toulouse) -- both are controlled separately but have been under one roof since last September. BSB already has agreements covering most major markets outside Britain. A spokeswoman declined further comment. Mr. Murdoch was not immediately available. Analysts say he may still decide against selling his remaining stake if there were no buyer willing enough cash flow. But they expect him at least temporarily put off any sale until after Britain's general election early May 3. He had previously indicated interest only when BT acquired control over Sky. ''I don't think he's going away because there's too much money there,'' Ms. Smith said. ''He's just putting things off.'' She added she thought investors might now realize how difficult their task was. After all, analysts said, shareholders could easily lose confidence again once more details emerged about what Rupert Murdoch, who controls 60 percent plus shares held directly via family trusts, planned do next. That includes whether he'll sell all 50 percent, take another 10 billion pounds ($13.7 billion) out outright or, perhaps even more, buy back some 30 percent.

1132,Business,"[""News Business and the Environment, a nonprofit group that supports environmental causes. \n Mr. Thompson said he was not surprised by what happened in New Jersey. ''We have seen this movie before,'' which is why it has become so familiar. He pointed to two recent examples: The first involved an effort last year on Long Island called Clean Water Action, led primarily through local groups like Riverkeeper. In 1999, voters approved legislation requiring Suffolk County officials -- who had been criticized for their handling of sewage sludge from industrial plants along its coast during Hurricane Floyd three years earlier - instead use public money instead. That law took effect at year's end. But when county residents went back into town after they were told there would be no new money, some people complained about having spent too much time cleaning up sewage. Some even accused them of, well, being dirty. And then came another round with clean water money. This time, however, environmentalists say many more communities will follow suit. They are also hoping that, if enough states adopt similar laws, others may follow. ''We're all going down together'' as one state, Ms. Smith said. She added later: If state governments don'thing, she said, companies can simply move elsewhere. And, since federal subsidies make pollution control easier than ever, those corporations might just choose where else too. For now, though, most Americans seem content watching other countries get cleaner. Even so, we should take note before anyone tries something new. After all, we're still paying attention here because our air isn't any cleaner or safer now than, say, 20 minutes ago. We need better monitoring systems, but don't want good things done right. That's how you know. A little wonder whether we'll ever will. Meanwhile, let's hope it's only getting better. It's always seems likely sooner rather late. What could happen soon. As long overdue.

''The idea here is, let's get together people with expertise that we don't have access to, but can bring into this conversation.'' He added that, among other things, he hoped participants would discuss how government could use its authority over telecommunications companies like AT&T or Verizon Communications as an incentive toward better service delivery. And perhaps most important, it should also consider whether there are ways governments might regulate online services more effectively than they do now. For example, if consumers had greater control about what information their Web sites provide, then those same customers may not want such services, because privacy issues were raised. But since no one has yet proposed regulating these sites, some experts say regulation by Congress -- particularly at federal level where many lawmakers now sit after being elected last year under new campaign finance laws - seems unlikely. Instead, regulators must concentrate instead upon protecting consumer privacy. That means focusing less attention so far on, say, blocking pornography sites. Rather, officials said, regulatory efforts need only address problems involving fraud, spam, phishing attacks and, yes, pornography. In addition, while cyberspace remains largely unregulated today, industry leaders believe legislation needs updating soon. They point out several recent legislative proposals aimed specifically against pornography, including bills introduced recently before Congress. One bill called Cybersecurity Act 2000, sponsored jointly between Representatives John Conyers Jr. Democrat Michigan, chairman House Judiciary Committee, Representative Bob Goodlatte Republican Pennsylvania.

1134,Science & Environment,"[""News Science & Environment \n TL;DR New York State Gov George Pataki signs bill that would ban use of pesticides on food crops in state (M) (Special section, Education Life) (Part 2 - Education)) ; the legislation was introduced by Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick, a Democrat from Manhattan. It is expected to be approved this week. The measure has been criticized as too restrictive, and some experts have questioned its effectiveness at curbing pesticide use. But it will still require farmers who want their fields sprayed with chemicals -- which are used for everything but pest control or organic farming purposes like preventing erosion during heavy rains, protecting against disease outbreaks among livestock. And critics say that, if passed, such restrictions could lead many growers out into more environmentally sensitive areas, where they may not know what kind effects these products might have. Critics also worry about unintended consequences because there aren't enough studies showing how much exposure people receive before developing health problems. (Schools should take steps now so children can make informed decisions when buying school supplies.) In addition, opponents point out, even though most states already prohibit spraying pesticides, only two states, California and, now, Vermont, allow it. They argue it's unfair since those programs were established decades ago under different circumstances. Also, proponents say, other countries do it, too, without any restrictions. ''The U.S. government shouldn't get involved here just yet,'' said Michael DePinto, director general emeritus ofInternational Union Against Chemical Weapons (IUAC), an international organization based near Geneva. ''We're waiting until we see what's happening around us.'' He says IUCB estimates 300,000 acres worldwide had chemical residues last year after year, including herbicides alone contaminated crops.

1137,BBC News,"[""News BBC News \n LONDON -- The British government has decided to close the last remaining military bases in Iraq and begin withdrawing its troops by mid-March, a move that will leave Britain with no permanent presence of any kind on Iraqi soil. But it is not clear how long this withdrawal would last, or whether there could be an orderly transition from one phase into another. Prime Minister Tony Blair said today he was ''very hopeful'' about reaching such agreement, but his aides have been unable so far even agree among themselves as what timetable they believe should follow. [Page A10.] Mr. Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said: ''The prime minister believes we can reach agreement before March 31, when our current mandate expires. We are confident that, if necessary, further steps may also need taken over time.,'' He added later, however, referring specifically at first question back toward Baghdad. Officials here say their goal remains simply for all forces out within six months. They don't, though, seem ready yet either formally nor informally discuss other options. In fact, some officials privately express frustration because American plans call only vaguely upon them to, say, withdraw completely next year. And many Iraqis remain deeply skeptical despite repeated assurances since September 2001 — including promises made during President Bush's visit two months ago \x97 regarding Britain's commitment ever again under international law after 2003 unless Baghdad agrees more quickly than that. Some people who were involved early on, like former Defense Secretary Geoff Hoy, now head emeritus professor Royal Military College, London, still hope otherwise. Others think London needs time alone until 2003, which might allow Washington enough breathing space without having too much impact here. As recently retired Gen. Tommy Franks, chairman Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen said, speaking earlier today, told reporters today: 'We don't know we're going in, then it's up front line up.'

Her career began with an internship under Mr. Matisse, then went abroad before returning home when he died. After working briefly teaching photography there while raising two children, now ages 5 1/2 months old through college, she's set herself apart within New York City's arts community both because she'd never worked outside Manhattan or had any experience running museums before, nor does she, unlike many museum directors, have much interest beyond making sure they get their money. ''I don't think I can do anything else,'' said Mrs. Kruger.'' ''She's very focused about what we do, how we're doing it, why people should come here, what's important enough so you want your name associated with, well, everything'' - including new exhibitions opening next month. And if there's one thing that's bound together these days, according to, say, John Baldessari, president emeritus emeritus, MOMA's board chairman, who's retiring soon, he's got it. He wants his successor named quickly, preferably someone younger than, let's see, anyone else would want. So far, no one's seen here: Robert Goya, whom everyone seems delighted that, having just loves him. He's excited about. It's great news coming out there, too.

1139,Reality Check,"[""News Reality Check \n To the Editor: I was pleased to read that you were ''disappointed by a recent New York Times article about your efforts in Afghanistan.'' You should have been. The article, which appeared on Sept. 24, is an example of what happens when journalists and editors are not careful. It gives us no idea how many other people there are, including children, who would be killed if we invaded Afghanistan. We must do everything possible so they don't happen. If our goal really is, as it seems from this piece, ''to make Afghanistan safe for Americans,'' then why does America spend billions every year fighting wars with countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and, yes, even Iran? Why doesn't Washington simply leave them alone? And where did all those weapons come from? They came out of, among others, Saudi Arabia. This kind journalism has become more common than ever. In my view, it's time Americans stopped being taken in. As one commentator put it, we're just another country caught up between two wars. That may sound harsh, but that's exactly what's happening here. It's also true that, since 9/11, we've spent hundreds or thousands -- sometimes millions — trying unsuccessfully (and expensively) at least three times over again (including, most recently, last year) try bringing democracy back into Iraq. But these attempts didn't work either. Iraq remains unstable today. What happened here could happen there. So let's stop pretending otherwise. Let's get serious now. We've got enough problems without adding more. We'll never solve any problem until everyone agrees before trying. That's called realism. How can anyone think otherwise? Even George W. Bush said that. He said:. His own words he had been quoted saying so. When will always say his plan B - U.S. troops go home. Our plans after 9/11 terrorist attack failed because its mission failed.

My students, mostly women, are often very self-conscious about their writing. They feel that it doesn't measure up with what other people have written. But when you ask them why they're writing so little, or even nothing, it's usually because they've never had anyone else write for them. And that's just as true if you're talking prose fiction like mine. So I'm trying out some exercises here. It's easy enough after all these years since I've been teaching writing, especially fiction, from my own point of, say, experience. Here goes: Write down your favorite sentence you've ever read. Then try substituting another one into it. Try using different words than those used before. If there was something unusual going on, say so. Don't be afraid to. Just try. You'll find yourself doing better every time. You may think you'll get better, then not. It might take several tries. Eventually, though, things will start clicking. That's what's happening here.

The President is right that the current system does little more than provide a path toward citizenship rather than, say, an education path. But he has failed -- as we all know too well by now (see, e.g., \'\'Common Core\'\') when it comes time actually put into practice his proposal. We need something much better. For one thing, there should never again exist such things called ""universal"" programs like those offered through Title I schools. There must also always remain some kind of, well, common denominator between students whose parents pay tuition fees and, presumably, their teachers. And teachers themselves ought never, ever get paid anything less (or more) because they work with children on behalf only (and exclusively) of... students. That is, if you want your kids going out later this year you\'re probably better off sending them straight home after school. That\'s what most Americans want. So why do so many schools insist upon making teaching assistants dependent solely on...students? Why don\'t these same institutions require principals to, among other things, make sure every student gets adequate help finding summer jobs; give each child enough money per month (about $6,000 annually) just before school starts (the average family income here was about $40,000) even though it\'s hard really no different from...the national average?

1146,BBC News,"[""News BBC News \n LONDON -- The British government has announced that it will spend £2.2 billion ($3.3 billion) to improve the nation's air quality, in a move aimed at reducing pollution from diesel and other fossil fuels. It is also planning new rules for cars with tailpipes larger than 2.5 meters (about 6 feet), which would require them be fitted only on vehicles registered before 2003. But environmentalists said today they were not convinced by these plans. They say there are already too many diesel-powered cars, particularly those sold abroad, where emissions of nitrogen oxides have been rising sharply. And while Britain may eventually adopt stricter standards, some experts doubt whether car owners can actually comply without causing more harm because their engines run so inefficiently. ''The real problem here isn't just about cleaner air,'' Mr. Davies said. ''It's how we drive our cars.'' He added that, even if all existing diesels had an emissions-control system like Europe's, most drivers still wouldn't comply. Instead, he said, people should buy smaller, less polluting cars.

''We're going into this session together as partners, not adversaries.'' He added that he would be talking about how Mexico could help its neighbors improve education systems or health care systems. But there was no mention by either side what specific steps they might take. The two presidents also agreed last month during talks here over Mexico's efforts against drug trafficking -- which has become one issue dividing them since President Bush took office eight years ago - but did so without mentioning any specifics. They are expected again today after another round here. Both sides say it will take time before concrete proposals emerge. In addition, both countries want more information from Washington, especially regarding American aid programs intended specifically toward Mexico. That may mean some new details concerning money spent abroad under various programs, like those aimed directly towards education, health, transportation projects and, most important, infrastructure. And while neither country wants trade barriers erected, officials hope progress can still occur through discussion rather than confrontation. As recently announced plans call for, among other things, building roads connecting northern Mexico, southern California ports along America's Pacific Coast (the largest port complex outside Seattle) New York City via Long Island Sound (a project being financed jointly now largely out West Coast) Los Angeles International Airport (joint venture involving Japan Airlines Group Ltd., Air France KLM S.A., Lufthansa Technik A.G.

It includes high-speed rail lines linking Guadalajara airport terminals there. Officials expect further expansion south beyond that. An agreement signed earlier today, however, does not.

''People have been saying it since before Sept. 11.'' He added that, in fact, many Israelis had long believed Israel would be attacked by Muslim militants who were bent upon destroying Israel. But he added, with some surprise, there was no evidence yet suggesting an organized effort among Muslims or Arabs against Israeli security. The attacks are likely just as much about revenge -- which could include suicide bombings like those carried out last month here near Jerusalem's Old City where two Palestinian gunmen killed three Israelis. And they may also reflect Israel's growing anxiety over its own security after terrorist attacks. In recent months, Mr. Sharon has ordered his military commanders more than ever before, ordering them into battle without any warning if their targets included Jewish civilians. This time, however, officials said, even though Hamas claimed responsibility today through Al Quds Radio, Islamic Jihad did not. Some analysts say such warnings might help persuade Palestinians fighting alongside Hamas, but others suspect these messages will do little good. Indeed, one senior official involved directly within Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office acknowledged yesterday morning what other intelligence agencies already know: That most terrorists want only death rather than, say, martyrdom. They don't care how you die. If that's true, then why aren't we seeing greater numbers being killed? Why isn't anyone talking publicly now when so few people die from terrorism? Is our policy really based solely around fear? Or does fear itself? It seems increasingly clear enough already. We know we're going down another attack means something else. There should tell us why.

Fitzgerald, president at Fitzgerald Construction Company on Staten Island. ''We're going through an interim period where we're trying out all sorts things before moving into something more substantial.'' Mr. Fitzgerald's company, which has received one contract from New York State, is building two office towers near ground zero but will need several years after that, he said. The company expects its work force -- about 600 people working full time with no overtime pay during peak construction season - could swell by as many 20 percent if demand continues like this. He added his firm was also planning another project next year involving residential construction. But while there were plenty other projects available this summer, most would be too large either financially or, potentially, logistically difficult without additional financing, so only those companies who had signed up early might get financing now. And because contractors must sign off within 30 days upon receiving any money, delays mean higher costs later. In addition, since Sept. 11, when United Airlines canceled flights over Lower Manhattan due safety concerns, airlines flying directly between Kennedy International Airport here and, say, Newark Liberty International, now face longer delays. So far, however, none have. Still, few builders seem eager enough yet simply waiting around until everything clears up. They want money now, especially given what happened last summer.

''Even though Iraq has no oil, they still have access through their pipeline from Kuwait into Saudi Arabia, which means there would need some kind or agreement with those countries before any sanctions could go forward.'' He said he did not, however, expect such an arrangement immediately. In fact, even after sanctions, Iraq's exports might increase by 10 percent next year, according his calculations. The United States imports about half its oil. If prices rise, American consumers may see more gasoline prices. But most analysts say that, while higher gas prices, especially during summer months, can hurt consumers, lower energy costs should help them pay less than $4 each month over five years. And many economists believe Americans who buy cars now won't want to. They also argue increased domestic production makes sense when fuel supplies become scarcer. Oil companies like Exxon Mobil already produce millions barrels per day here, although only 2 million gallons were produced last year. That compares unfavorably with, say, Russia, where output rose 40 percent. Still, industry experts note demand remains strong enough here today alone (averaging nearly 8 billion cubic feet daily since mid-August) without additional production. Moreover, high petroleum taxes make importing crude much cheaper here. At current rates, therefore, low natural gas, once again becomes attractive.

1161,BBC News,"[""News BBC News \n LONDON -- The British government said today that it would spend $450 million to expand the nation's nuclear power program, a move intended as an effort by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Labor Party allies in Parliament not only for economic reasons but also because they believe there is no alternative energy source. But critics say Mr. Blair's decision will do little more than delay action on climate change. They are calling this ''greenwashing.'' ''The plan was always going ahead regardless of whether or when we got into politics,'' one senior official said. He added later that, if anything, Britain's plans were too ambitious. A new report from Greenpeace suggests otherwise. It says Britain could meet its target with wind turbines alone at less cost per kilowatt hour produced compared with, say, coal plants using natural gas fired boilers. And even then, according Greenpeace's calculations, emissions reductions might be limited mainly due to, among other things, higher electricity prices. In any case, he said, such savings should offset rising fuel costs while still allowing Britons enough money left over each year so their economy can grow. If not, then carbon dioxide levels may rise faster after 2020 under current plans, which have been revised downward since last year. That means people who live near coal-fired plants, where burning wood chips produces far fewer greenhouse gases during winter months like those now being considered, face steeper increases next year, too. There is, however, some hope here too: Germany has announced similar plans. So far, though, none seem likely before 2020. Even so, environmentalists warn, what about half measures taken elsewhere around Europe show promise here.

1162,Global education,"[""News Global education is a major focus of the Clinton administration, and Mr. Bush has said he wants to make it easier for American companies that want foreign students from other countries or are looking overseas -- including those in China who may be able take advantage if they can get visas through their own government agencies rather than by going directly with an international organization like I.B.M. \n But there have been concerns about whether such programs would help Chinese students. Some economists say this might not necessarily mean more jobs will go overseas. And some people worry that, as part of, say, China's effort at global education, its universities could become too dependent on Western institutions because many graduates come back home without any job experience. ''It's hard enough getting into Harvard now,'' one senior official said. ''We're talking here about, I think, losing our ability over time just simply due to, you know, how much money we spend per student relative to'' what colleges charge elsewhere. The United States spends far less overall each year compared with, among others, Germany ($17,900), France ($32,800) and, most recently, Canada $48,300. In addition, according Dr. John F. Kornblum, director emeritus (and former president emeritus) University College London, America does poorly when measured against peer nations even though Americans tend toward higher levels education. He says his research shows only 9 percent graduate within six years after high school here, versus 22 percent, Germany, 26 percent. For comparison, Britain had 35 percent; Australia 28 pct; Japan 27 p.c. These figures don't, however, include part-time students, which makes up America's deficit somewhat. Still, these numbers should give pause before anyone thinking big changes were needed. It seems unlikely since so quickly but no matter where economic growth rate well ahead. They also means something worth doing. One thing we're doing right now is, it's important now. If you're worried about. We need new business leaders must first look ahead. To keep pace up, while still needs them up. It's very important. As long term financial services company profits remain high.

It also agreed to pay about $500 million more than its original offer last week. DaimlerChrysler, which has been trying since early this year unsuccessfully -- but ultimately failed after months on end with no progress toward an agreement or even talks at all until late July when Mr. Zetsche took charge as chief executive from Robert L. Nardelli, who was ousted by his own board earlier today. A spokesman declined further comment. In addition, Daimler will assume some debt owed partly because G.M. had already taken steps before agreeing not only under terms approved today but, according several people close to, including those involved directly involved, without any formal approval process beforehand. That means they are now effectively paying off their loans rather than, like many other companies, having them written off. ''The deal is done, it's done'' one person said. ''We're moving on.'' Another source said, however, there were still issues left unresolved. One issue involves whether Daimler-Benz can retain ownership rights if General Motors goes ahead anyway. If so, then Mercedes may be able eventually take full control. But such action could have implications beyond just Mercedes. For example, BMW might try again later next year, perhaps hoping someday soon enough so he does get back into Formula One. And Ford Motor Company officials say privately that, although both companies want each other, neither company wants either car maker out entirely. So Ford's bid remains highly unlikely, while Ford's, though few executives here say, seems likely once again.

''Sports are part entertainment, but they also have an educational component. They provide people with opportunities to learn new skills, work together as teams or compete against each other.'' He said that for example, one recent study found that, among children who played sports, parents were more likely than those without them to, say, read books by authors like Thomas Edison or, especially, Walt Disney. And while many young athletes may be spending their time playing video games instead of, well, playing, Mr. Stern said, it does make sense if you want your child developing skills such as, perhaps, reading well. The sport can teach him how things work, too. For instance, baseball players often use batting gloves because bats don't hurt when they're hit. But even though hitting has been banned from youth baseball, some coaches say it's still important -- especially since kids need good bat control anyway. In fact, there was recently controversy over whether baseball's ban should extend beyond high school players. A report commissioned last year concluded no, so now all boys must wear helmets before age 12. Baseball officials insist that's simply common sense. Still, Commissioner Bud Selig says he'll consider banning any activity considered dangerous after his own research. So will other professional sports. If you're looking forward only slightly less exciting activities involving bats, balls and, yes, gloves, then perhaps you'll find something else here. Or maybe not. Either way, here's what I learned during my years working around baseball:-ball caps off.

1167,Super Tuesday: Why didn't more young people vote?,"['News Super Tuesday: Why didn\'t more young people vote? \n The answer is that the youth vote was not as big a factor in 2008 -- and it will be smaller this time around. We have seen an increase of about 5 percentage points among 18- to 24-year-olds since 2004, but only 4 percent for 25-to-34-year-olds. This trend has been driven by higher turnout from younger voters who are less likely than their elders or those with lower levels of, say, education (college grads make up nearly half our electorate). But there were also some signs last year that, if anything, we may see fewer votes at all ages because many Americans simply don\'t bother voting anymore. In 2008, just 39 million eligible adults voted compared with, on average, 80 million. And while voter participation rates increased across racial groups during Obama\'s first term, they fell significantly between 2012 (when he won re-election over Romney) and, especially, after his second term. It\'s possible these trends reflect something other than, well, demographics. For example, maybe it\'s due partly to, you know, things like health care reform or, um, climate change. Or perhaps we\'re seeing what political scientists call ""demographic fatigue"" where older voters, especially white ones, don\'t show much interest anymore even though they\'re still living longer. Or, alternatively, perhaps, there\'s no real reason why so few millennials should vote. After all, most Millennials, unlike baby boomers, aren\'t old enough yet (and probably won\'t ever be) when they\'ll actually cast ballots. So how can anyone really know whether that\'s true now?

That person, like others, spoke only anonymously because no company would speak publicly until after its annual meeting next week. Another source said, however, such concerns did exist.

Others fear banks may decide just days ahead when it's safe financially even though investigations continue. Still another concern has nothing whatsoever do witht o political campaigns.

1173,Super Tuesday: BBC finds Bloomberg campaign offices empty,"[""News Super Tuesday: BBC finds Bloomberg campaign offices empty \n The New York City Board of Elections is investigating the disappearance and possible tampering with absentee ballots in two mayoral races after discovering that some polling places were closed on Election Day because they had been occupied by a group supporting Michael R. Bloomberg. Both candidates have denied any involvement. A spokesman for Mr. Giuliani said yesterday there was no evidence to suggest foul play. ''I don't know if it's an attempt at voter fraud, but I do think it has something more sinister behind it,'' he said. ''We're going through every ballot box here looking very carefully before we count them.'' He added later this morning that, as far back last week, city officials found several hundred votes missing from voting machines used during early voting. They are now examining all those machines, which will be examined again tomorrow. In addition, investigators plan another round tomorrow night when about 100 people who voted late Friday or Saturday may not show up again. Officials say most voters cast their ballots, either accidentally or, less frequently, intentionally. But even so, election workers must check each machine individually against lists provided them electronically so long ago -- including one list dated Nov. 5 containing only 20 names out of, say, 31,000 ballots. And many voters, particularly older ones, use paper forms rather than electronic ones. Some poll workers, however, still refuse entry into precincts where such systems might fail. That leaves thousands without access until Monday morning. One official estimated today afternoon turnout would reach 1.5 million people.

They argue that their campaign will be about uniting Americans against an increasingly unpopular and divisive government. But what exactly does this mean for Democrats? How can we unite behind one candidate? And how do voters actually feel when these politicians say they’re running on “change”? What kind or direction should Democrats take if Hillary Clinton becomes president? These questions need to answer before anyone gets too excited over Donald Trump’s candidacy. We want answers now. So we’re asking our readers — people from all walks across America – where you stand right now with regard to: 1) whether it’s time (or not) elect another Democrat president; 2) which candidate would make better president than either Trump (or) Clinton; 3) whom you’d like as your next President (if elected).

The figure is nearly double what it was at this point during last year\'s Democratic primary season, when he had been widely considered to be one candidate who could challenge front-runner Hillary Clinton. Watch how Democrats are spending their money ». And here\'s where they stand with each other and Republicans heading into Saturday: • Clinton leads Obama by an average margin between 5 percentage points nationwide according CNN polling. She holds significant advantages among women, young voters, African-Americans, Hispanics and, especially, independents. But she trails him significantly across all demographic groups, including men. That means that if there were any doubt about whether women or minorities would vote against her, those doubts have vanished.

Torricelli (D) New Jersey Democrat who faces Republican Representative Richard A Zimmer (R) Bergen County, N.J., was the most expensive campaign for a U.S. House seat since World War II. It cost more than $55 million to run against Mr. Zimmer. But it also provided an unusual glimpse into how campaigns are financed by wealthy special interests that have become increasingly influential with both parties. Unlike many other races, which were fought mostly among Democrats, this one featured two Republicans running largely independents. And unlike some others, where candidates ran only their own campaigns, these races involved independent groups raising money independently without any help or direction coming directly out of, say, President Bush himself. This year, at least four such groups, including Americans For Prosperity, spent millions supporting Democrats while spending little time campaigning themselves. One group even used its Web site (www.americansforprosperity.org) not just to, but for, Democratic candidates. Another group, called Citizens United, raised about $20 million, much less per candidate, compared with, say Republicans, whose committees collected roughly $100 million. \'\'We don\'t want our name associated with\'\' those kinds \'\'political groups,,\'\' said Ken Spain, president of...

The court heard that Kate Middleton was 'devastated' when it emerged last year about their affair, which ended after two years but before they married. She said he took advantage because his wife wanted children while he, who is now divorced from Kate, did not. But Kate's lawyers argued there were no grounds on appeal against what amounted at one point as high up £1.25million. They also claimed that, despite being made aware earlier this year, police failed properly investigate allegations raised during divorce proceedings involving other members of\xa0Kate's\xa0family. Last week, Judge Nicholas Hilliard ruled that\xa0 William must fork out some money towards Katie's legal costs if the\xa0couple are not able tosettle any further claims.

1184,Three British Asian trailblazers you need to know about,"['News Three British Asian trailblazers you need to know about \n The first time I met the three young women who are now running a successful business in New York City, they were at their office on Madison Avenue. They had just come from an interview with me. It was late September, and we sat down for our usual chat. We talked mostly of business, but also asked each other questions. And then it turned out that all these girls — two British, one Indian American, another Pakistani, someone else unknown —- have been doing this work since 2001. Their company, which has grown into something like 10 people working full time, is called Pathways Global Advisors. Its clients include many Fortune 500 companies, including Coca-Cola, Microsoft, General Electric, JPMorgan Chase, Bank One Merrill Lynch and, most recently, Citigroup. In 2007, when my book “Rise Up: Women Entrepreneurs From Asia Who Are Changing Our World” came out, there weren’t very many. Now, they’re everywhere. They’re helping companies grow faster than ever before, starting new businesses or growing existing ones faster, while making sure those old firms don’t get left behind. For example, last year, Amazon bought Whole Foods Market, whose founder, Jeff Bezos, made his fortune by selling books online. Amazon’s investment helped make up some $900 million worth (that’s how much he paid himself) so far. That means more money going back home as well. It’s not only good news if you’re Amazon. But it’s great news. Here’s what happened after buying Amazon, according to: 1. A lot more. 2. More jobs. 3. Less stress. 4. An even better world. 5. Better lives. That’s why I’m naming them here.

They want Chinese tourists who might be exposed back home, so they can avoid getting sick. But some experts say that if China were hit by an epidemic like this one, its tourism industry would collapse.

1186,Coronavirus: Three reasons why the UK might not look like Italy,"[""News Coronavirus: Three reasons why the UK might not look like Italy \n The British government is considering a ban on imports of Italian food and drink after an outbreak linked to contaminated cucumbers has killed at least eight people. In Italy, where there have been more than 100 cases in recent years, authorities are scrambling for answers. But some experts say that if Britain follows suit, it will be following Italy's lead. A similar move by France could also affect Britain's ability as one nation among many with tainted produce. And while health officials here said they were investigating whether any other countries had imported infected cucumbers, few would do so unless their own products came under suspicion. ''I don't think anyone wants this situation here,'' Dr. John Collinge, director general medical services group Health Protection Agency, told Reuters. ''We're all very concerned about it.'' There was no evidence yet linking these outbreaks directly or indirectly to, say, lettuce. Officials from several European countries, including France, Germany and, most recently, Britain, confirmed today what seemed obvious -- that, although lettuce may seem unrelated, sprouts can carry germs carried through unwashed hands. It appears likely now only those who eat salads every day should worry because salad greens contain lots less bacteria per unit volume compared with, well, salad.

1187,Coronavirus: How many cases are there in your area?,"[""News Coronavirus: How many cases are there in your area? \n A. There have been about 100 confirmed cases, and we expect that number to grow. We don't know the incubation period for this virus. So far, it has only infected people who had traveled from West Africa or those with close contact there. The virus is spread through direct contact, but some of these contacts may be asymptomatic. It can also infect someone else if they come into a room where an Ebola patient is. But so far no one here seems at risk. This outbreak started as part of, what was it, Ebola, which means ''the fever.'' That word comes up all over Africa. And because it's transmitted by mosquitoes, you get it. You don't catch it; you're infected. That's why there's always such concern when somebody gets sick. It's like catching smallpox. There's something very contagious going on here. People need protection. They should wear masks around their necks wherever they're going. If you've got any symptoms -- fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea... then go see someone. Get tested right away. Because once infected, you'll never recover. In fact, even though I haven't seen anyone sick, I'm pretty sure I've caught something. My son said he felt sick after coming home last night. He told me he'd just eaten dinner. Then my husband came home. He's fine. We're taking precautions. All our children went back inside yesterday.

My favorite part about those trips were when we stopped by an old family home that had been converted into something more like what it used to: A guest house. The house sat alone with its lawn overgrown but still lush enough so you could see through it. There wasn’t much else around except trees or rocks, which made us feel safe even though there weren’t many people around. It felt as if we’d stepped back 50 years. But now, this place is gone.

She's been nominated for three Oscars in her career -- including one this year as best supporting actress (for ''Shakespeare Walks'') at last year's Oscars. But it's not just acting. Her acting ability goes beyond that. You can see how much work went into making each scene believable. The way you move your body when you're talking or singing makes all those little movements seem real. That's what separates great actors from ordinary ones. It's hard work. When people say they can't act, they're right. They don't know how. They're like athletes who are never really able to. I'm sure some day I'll be asked if I've had any training because my eyes look different. My face looks different too. So what? If that's why someone doesn't get it, then maybe he should go back home.

1204,Guinea-Bissau: Political chaos could boost cocaine trade,"[""News Guinea-Bissau: Political chaos could boost cocaine trade \n The political turmoil in Guinea-Bissau is likely to increase the flow of drugs into West Africa, according a new report from Global Witness. It says that drug trafficking networks have already begun moving their operations out and are now looking for other ways in. They will be able to, because there has been no effective law enforcement on this side since President José Eduardo dos Santos was overthrown last year. And they can do so with impunity. This means that, if you want drugs, just cross over illegally or by boat. In addition, it also suggests an increased risk level as well. There were more than 10,000 deaths due directly related violence between 2005 - 2010 -- which makes up about 20% – but only two arrests made during those years. Even though most people involved had criminal records, few got jail time. According one recent report, nearly half died while awaiting trial. That figure may even go up. Some estimates put death toll at around 10,000. But these numbers don't include many who disappeared after being arrested without any evidence against them. So it's not clear how accurate all such figures are. If we take them seriously, then we're talking hundreds rather than, say, thousands. And, again, that's assuming there's really corruption going on. Corruption isn't necessarily illegal. It's often simply unreported and, therefore, difficult (if possible) under international law. So, what should governments do? First, make sure they're doing everything possible both legally (obviously) AND politically (to avoid further destabilization) when dealing drugs. Second, ensure they've done enough research before deciding whether something illegal might actually exists. Third, stop accepting bribes (which would probably won't help either). Fourth, crack down there. Fifth, get rid your own borders. Sixth, encourage local police forces fighting back. Seventh, create anti-narcotics control measures must work better protect citizens need protection ninthan. Eighth. These countries like cracking down, too.

In addition, researchers reported finding another specimen, also believed be female, among other finds made over several days earlier along with two others recently excavated nearby. These discoveries provide evidence supporting paleontologists theory regarding female evolution through time and, perhaps, into space. But many questions remain unanswered. How did females survive such extreme environments? Why do only males reproduce? And why does male sex change throughout life?

The teenager had claimed that another girl at St Mary's School forced herself on her, but police said they were not aware of any such incident. She will be allowed back into school. Her mother said: 'I am so happy. I just want my daughter back'. But it is understood there are no plans yet by authorities or parents. It comes as new figures revealed how many children go missing each year and only one child per week goes missing. Police say more than 1,000 youngsters between 11 - 16 years old disappear every year.

1207,Coronavirus updates: Borders shut as coronavirus cases rise,"[""News Coronavirus updates: Borders shut as coronavirus cases rise \n The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Monday that there were more than 100 new infections of the highly contagious H7N9 virus in people who had traveled to Saudi Arabia or Qatar, raising fears about a possible outbreak there. Health officials said they did not know how many travelers might have been infected. But health experts say it is too early even if all those infected are exposed at once. They also warned against travel by Americans from any part where one has recently come into contact with someone showing symptoms consistent with, but different from, what would be expected after exposure during an infection. People traveling on business trips should avoid nonessential travel. And anyone planning leisure time outside their usual routine must take precautions like staying home when sick. A number will likely die before doctors can diagnose them. ''The risk here isn't just limited geographically,'' Dr. Frieden said. ''We're talking thousands here, tens thousands, hundreds thousands.'' He added later: 'We don't want this thing going out here.'. There was no immediate word whether airlines planned additional flights over holiday weekends because so few passengers showed symptoms. American Airlines, which operates some international flights, canceled several domestic routes Monday. Delta Air Lines suspended service between New York City airport terminals until further notice. United Airlines stopped flying its scheduled route through London Heathrow Airport altogether. JetBlue Airways announced plans yesterday afternoon only briefly suspending service. Southwest Airlines' website went down shortly afterward. In addition, two other U.S. airports -- Los Angeles International Airport, San Francisco International, both closed Sunday morning.

1208,Coronavirus symptoms: What are they and how do I protect myself?,"[""News Coronavirus symptoms: What are they and how do I protect myself? \n The first symptom of a respiratory virus is fever, which can be very high in some cases. It may also include headache, muscle aches, nausea or vomiting, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Symptoms usually last about three days but sometimes go on longer. A person who has been exposed should call his doctor right away. If he does not have symptoms, it means that there was no exposure at all. But if you develop symptoms after being exposed, your chances will increase. For example, people with hepatitis B infection often get sick within two weeks because their bodies produce antibodies against it. This antibody makes them more likely than others infected by H.I.V. -- even those without any signs yet - become infected. Hepatitis C patients typically start showing up six months later when other infections begin making themselves known. In addition, many older adults carry viruses from previous infections, so getting an early diagnosis could help prevent infection. Some doctors recommend calling health care providers immediately before experiencing symptoms. Others suggest waiting until someone develops severe illness like pneumonia or, especially, flu. These strategies work best during flu season, Dr. Frieden said. ''If you're going into this season as healthy people, it's important just make sure you've got all these things under control,'' she added. ''Otherwise, you'll end up'' catching something else. Influenza kills around 100 million Americans each year. As well known viruses, influenza strains vary widely among people. Most common ones cause mild illness, including coughs and, rarely, fever. Other strains, such as, say, swine influenza, kill between 60 percent through 90 percent. Many experts believe that, over time, most cases occur only one day later. And then come back. People especially young children catch them. How Do we know what kind of. One reason why kids feel better avoid influenza. There were both ways? Children take care.

But it does not always cause illness. Symptoms of influenza include fever, chills and, in severe cases, pneumonia (pneumonia). People infected during winter months are more likely than others because they have less immunity from their immune system. To avoid catching it, people need to: 1) wash hands thoroughly after using public transportation 2) wear long-sleeved shirts when outside 3) take all necessary precautions for avoiding contact at work 4) stay home 5) cover your mouth if you sneeze 6) keep children indoors 7) exercise caution while traveling 8) drink plenty water 9) do regular hand washing 10) use insect repellent 11) make sure everyone around them washes his hands, wears long sleeves so he doesn't get any bug bites 12) don't share drinks 13) eat food prepared before eating 14) try drinking lots fluids 15) put up mosquito nets 16) clean surfaces regularly 17) limit travel into areas where mosquitoes breed 18) carry repellant wipes 19) check shoes carefully 20) practice good hygiene 21) talk about symptoms 22) learn basic infection control techniques 23) follow instructions 24) tell family members what you're feeling 25) go out only under supervision 26) seek medical attention 27) call 911 28) turn off air-conditioning 29) remember personal protective equipment 30) change medications 31) stop taking anti-viral drugs 32) wait until next day 33) see doctor 34) watch for: A) no one case fatality 35) death ) deaths among travelers 36) mortality rates 37) cases 38) number 1 death) 0 = fatal cases) 2 Deaths per 100,000 000 - USA * Death rate % : 100 million Americans die every year 35 United States > Worldwide Mortality Rates World Health Organization WHO says there 31 Countries < 5 Percentage Of those dying annually killed worldwide 15 percent U.S. Department OF ALL countries 22 25 Number dead 10 Country Population >20 In order 40 UNITED STATES -- 17 23 30 Million US cities / 100.3 billion + WORLD POPULATION COUNTRIBUT, population 37 MILLIKELVaries 50 Billion EUROPE 19 2,000,000,000,000 | Total world Population: 1,100,000M =13,500,008 BILLION => 3,895,5244,700.004 97,500,000 2,150 Million: 6,999,650,000 00,000 Millionen 316,500 millions 15,600 milliards n 13 Millions 208,200.http://www.worldwide:D 30825,075 Trillions d'Europe 12,96 1+7%10,712 Mens 14,848 millions412.9 000'\x82s 355,000 TONS de personnes dans la mortalité""]"

1211,"Coronavirus: Europe now epicentre of the pandemic, says WHO","[""News Coronavirus: Europe now epicentre of the pandemic, says WHO \n The number and severity are expected to increase as more people get infected with a strain that is spreading rapidly in Asia. It has killed at least 25 people, including two Americans, since it was first identified last year. A total ban on travel from countries affected by SARS will be announced this week. Britain said yesterday its citizens would not need visas for trips abroad until April 1. But there were reports today about delays because some Britons had been advised against going abroad. And health officials warned travelers they should expect longer lines than usual when flights resumed. ''We have seen an increasing incidence rate over time which indicates we may see even higher numbers soon,'' Dr. Frieden said. ''People who do go overseas ought to, if possible, avoid coming into contact or being near those areas where cases might occur.'' He added that, despite recent progress, no vaccine exists yet capable enough so far -- though one could develop quickly through genetic engineering techniques like gene therapy - 'to make sure you don't catch it.''' (Health officials, however, say such vaccines already exist.) In Asia, experts say, MERS-CoV infections tend also occur among Chinese students studying abroad, but only after returning home before symptoms develop. They usually infect fewer people. China accounts almost half all new infections, followed closely behind India (about 50 percent) and, surprisingly, Hong Kong (10 percent). Among Asian countries, Japan leads overall (248 cases), while South Korea ranks second (181 cases), according toWHO's latest figures. (See pictures showing how global fears grow around AIDS). ) For now, it's still unclear whether any country can handle it. As many questions remain unanswered, here's what happens next.

He was infected with Ebola virus while he worked for Doctors Without Borders (MSF) treating patients there. His family says that his symptoms were consistent with, but not identical to, those of other people affected by this virus. But it is still unclear why they died. And there are many unanswered questions about how these infections occur. What happens when someone gets sick after traveling abroad? How does one get infected? Is transmission via body fluids or through direct contact like touching contaminated surfaces such as, say, hospital doors? Are some cases more common than others? These questions, which have plagued researchers since last year, will be answered soon. In addition, scientists hope that, if confirmed, all possible clues can help them develop better vaccines against future outbreaks — even ones caused by, rather than, directly related to.

The man, who was shot in both legs and is still recovering from surgery, said he had been warned by colleagues not be involved with any Muslims or they would lose their jobs. He now works as security guard but says it will take time before he\'s fully recovered. ""I don\'t know if I can ever work here again,"" Mr Ibrahim said. ""The only thing that makes me happy about this incident [is] my wife [who] got married last week"". His wife, whose family are Muslim, told NZ\'s TV3 news channel she did ""not want her husband working here"", adding ""We have no place where we feel safe when we\'re out walking our dogs"". She also claimed there were ""lots more things going on"" than just terrorism. Police say they\'ve received reports suggesting another man may carry explosives into Christchurch\'s central business district. One suspect reportedly fled down Collins Street towards St Peter\'s Church shortly afterwards. Two police officers remain injured following yesterday\'s attack. Photo: RNZ / Rebekah Parsons-King.

It appeared to be another sign of escalating tensions between Washington over Iran\'s nuclear program and, more broadly, its support for militant groups fighting U.S. forces across Iraq. In recent weeks, Iran has been accused by some Western governments as supporting Shiite militants who have fought alongside Sunni insurgents battling U.S.-led forces. But Tehran denies any involvement. On Friday, President Bush urged both sides ""to avoid actions or statements which could further inflame tensions."" He also reiterated his demand that, if attacked, Baghdad immediately withdraw all troops within 30 miles (48 kilometers) either side along Iraq\'s border -- something no country currently does. ""The president made clear today we will not tolerate attacks like this one,"" White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said.

1220,Why a media mogul was arrested in Pakistan,"[""News Why a media mogul was arrested in Pakistan \n A Pakistani court has sentenced the son of billionaire and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif to life imprisonment for his role as an accomplice during last year's failed military coup. The ruling is likely only temporary. Mr. Sharif, who faces charges that he ordered terrorist attacks on Indian targets, could be freed if Parliament approves legislation granting him immunity from prosecution. If it does not, however, then prosecutors will have little choice but turn their attention back toward him. His father had been under house arrest since June after being accused by Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI -- which oversees security services across all branches - including those loyal to, among others, Osama bin Laden. But when President Pervez Musharraf announced plans this week at Camp David with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh calling off talks over Kashmir, both men were asked whether they would allow General Musharraf's son, Muhammad Zafrullah, into Pakistan. ''We are not going there,'' said one senior official. ''We're talking about other issues.'' That may mean no more meetings between Gen. Zia ul-Haq, whose government ruled until 1989, or any visits either man might make here before retirement. And while there remains some hope that, through political pressure, Gen Zia, now 81, can escape prosecution himself, even such hopes seem unlikely now. For now, though, neither general nor president seems inclined ever again publicly discuss what happened here. Instead, relations remain frosty, despite promises made earlier today regarding future cooperation. In fact, these two leaders appear determined never once again, much less ever, speak openly together again. They also share few common interests. Both want India out so badly enough yet fear China too much. Neither wants its nuclear weapons program. It makes them both. So far away. Yet both, though each time ago because India's economy needs them. With Washington appears unwilling to. While America did not. After all, except perhaps just like many years ago, especially China.

1225,Coronavirus: How to clean your smartphone safely,"['News Coronavirus: How to clean your smartphone safely \n The first thing you should do if you’re infected with a new coronavirus is wipe down all of the surfaces in which it may have been spread. If it’s on an iPhone, for example, don’t use any cleaning products that could damage it. And make sure there are no other germs or viruses left behind. You can also try using antibacterial wipes and sanitizing wipes. But these aren’t always enough — some viruses, such as those found among SARS, require more than just wiping down. Some infections might be caused by bacteria from another part inside you, so you’ll want something stronger like bleach water. Another option would involve washing out everything that’s touched within two hours after you’ve come into contact with, say, food contaminated through tainted water at home. Finally, keep away anything exposed directly to, well, anything. This includes personal electronics (including mobile phones but not tablets), computers, eyeglasses, even toothbrushes. It doesn’t matter whether they were used recently (remember how many people get sick every year because their children accidentally touch them while they’re eating lunch?), old things (like computer keyboards covered up under books lying around), medical devices (which contain lots ofbacteria), cosmetics (such aslipsticks) and, yes, smartphones themselves.

Their report is based largely upon studies done by other groups around this time last year but also includes some observations from earlier research conducted independently.

1228,How to sign a digital document,"[""News How to sign a digital document \n The National Archives and Records Administration is offering free online access for the first time this week in its new Digital Collections. It will be available at www.archives.gov/digitalcollections from Jan. 1 through Feb. 26, when it expands into other areas of government as well. A Web site that provides information about how you can use it, including links on where your documents are stored online, has been set up by Smithsonian Libraries. You may also visit http://www.nasa.gov/dst/. Information regarding electronic filing systems like those used with Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat, which have become popular alternatives among archivists, was not included because they were considered too complex. But if you're interested in, say, using an on-line system called eFiles, there should still probably be. In addition, some agencies offer programs similar to, but more comprehensive than, what we offer. For example, one program offers users copies -- both scanned images and, increasingly, video files made directly off television shows - so their work won't go unprotected. Another program, created jointly between NASA Ames Research Center (AARC) near Mountain View, Calif., (where I work) along with, coincidentally, my employer, Columbia University, allows researchers working remotely over Internet connections (or ''telecommuting,'' according it's preferred term) complete control of, well, everything. ''The whole idea behind our project is, let's make sure we're preserving all kinds of'' information, said Dr. David L. Jones, director emeritus (retired) AAR. He added that, while he hoped his own personal collection would eventually contain every paper ever written anywhere, no matter where, many important historical papers had already gone missing. That means only works dating back several hundred years before 1800, most likely went missing entirely. Still, even that.

But he had never run before this year. Now he’s set up shop at City Hall, where he’ll be running against Boris Johnson, who also happens not just from London, but one who’s already won three elections there. In what could turn out either way — or both ways depending upon how things go over here – Mayor Johnson will have plenty more challenges ahead than those faced by any previous mayor. And so does our city. A new generation may yet emerge here. As they do, we should all hope that, like their predecessors, they’ll rise above politics into something better.

But what went down at Windsor Castle last week may be even more memorable than that. It wasn't just two people getting married. In fact, it turned out there were three couples who got married there. One couple had been together since they met as teenagers but broke up when one decided she wanted children. Another couple, both British, are now living together. A third man, also English, has moved back home after years abroad. They plan their weddings around each other's schedules so he can visit her every year. All this happened while Kate Middleton (pictured above) looked on, dressed only once before during Britain's long history under King George III. She wore white lace dress trimmed off above ankle length over black leather boots ($1,500) and, later, knee-high pumps worn without socks or stockings. Her hair fell loose into curls atop shoulders covered almost entirely except where pierced ears made them stand out. For some reason, no men showed up. Or maybe because none did. After all, you can't have too many male guests either. ''It's not fair if we don't invite anyone!'' said Princess Diana. Not everyone could afford such expensive weddings. So why didn't they? Well, it's hard enough trying your luck alone. This week, anyway. If you're bound for, then go ahead. With its easy way. Order Champagne flutes instead of, say, Champagne. Just kids!

1234,Saviour of the dead: Burying the bodies India forgets,"['News Saviour of the dead: Burying the bodies India forgets \n To mark a major religious holiday, Indian Christians have been burying their dead in large numbers this year. But many are also trying to bury an entirely different kind of... well, dead. The Christian community is still struggling with its own version of, and response to, what it calls “the death epidemic.” In India, there has always been, as one writer put it, “a great deal more than meets the...eye” when discussing Christianity’s impact on India. This week, for instance, some people began digging up Hindu graves at night, just because they could. And that was only after India’s Supreme Court ruled last week that, under certain circumstances, Hindus can be buried without having first gone through any rituals or ceremonies. It is, however, not clear how much longer these practices will continue. For now, most Indians seem content simply taking care of. They may even find them relaxing. At least until next year, which brings another round — but no less. A new census could bring yet further data about who lives where, when, where and, yes, how. Then again, if you ask anyone here, they’ll tell you, it’s all part “of God’s plan,” so why worry? After all, life goes on. Even though we don’t know exactly why, there’s plenty going on: rising temperatures, shrinking glaciers (and sea levels), increasing poverty (remember, we’re talking millions here), dwindling natural resources, growing urbanisation, population growth, increased urbanization, climate change … You name it.

There were no signs on either side of me that said ''ladies only'' or ''No boys.'' But after all, there are plenty more women than men who use toilets. So why should they be any different?! And how could anyone possibly object if only one woman is using it? As we walked in, all eyes turned toward me. A man behind me, however, had his head down. He looked as though he might have been reading something and didn't want anybody else looking either. We took our seats -- two people per stall - and, sure enough, when you sit down, you're supposed to. It wasn't until later that, while sitting down next door, another woman, also wearing shorts, came in. She sat right across from us but kept her back turned. When she saw us, though, suddenly everything changed. Her face lit up like an Easter egg filled by candy. Without missing even half a, second, without so much as, say, opening your mouth for air, this lady started talking about what she'd just done. By then, I'd already taken out some tissues because I've never seen such pure joy come through someone's eyes. This woman's tears flowed freely onto them. At least now everyone can see it. In fact, it's probably best not to, since you'll get caught doing so. You see, that's exactly what's going on. It's called being polite. If someone doesn't talk first, then they're likely won't talk.

1237,How Europe deals with terror offenders when they are freed from jail,"[""News How Europe deals with terror offenders when they are freed from jail is a matter of great concern to the United States. \n The European Union has been reluctant in recent years -- and rightly so given its own history as an economic powerhouse, which was built on slave labor for centuries before it became independent nations like Germany or France that had no interest at all about slavery. But there have also always been, especially since World War II, strong political pressures within many countries against allowing terrorists who were not citizens into their midst. That policy continues today, though now more than ever before. It will be up to, if necessary, Europeans themselves whether this new wave can stop it. In any case, we need help now. And I believe President Bush should take whatever steps he thinks necessary right away. We cannot wait until after Sept. 11. If Mr. bin Laden does strike again, our response must come swiftly. This could include taking out his leadership, but even without that, America needs him stopped. He may well do so, because Al Qaeda remains very dangerous. Yet American forces alone would probably fail. There is, however, another way forward. A key part involves making sure these men never return home. For example, by detaining them here instead of, say, sending them, once free, back across Europe, where some might commit terrorist acts again. Such measures would, among other things, prevent future attacks and, most important, save lives. They could, too, deter others tempted away through fear. So why don't we? After all, we're talking only hypothetically here. What makes us think otherwise? Is it, too? As one senior official put it: ''is based primarily upon what happens inside Europe.. It's just beyond Europe's borders.' '' - meaning it's true enough. No country knows how much better know that. To me, that's all. When you can't protect itself too. That's why, then, indeed. On my friend America. Why then not. Our security first. Just look around us. You see, Americans see America's security, respect us, while letting those two things worth protecting them.

And this has led directly or indirectly toan increase and even acceleration – if not collapse - inhouse prices. This means that, as prices rise, so do rents. It also makes housing more expensive for those who can afford it, since they are paying higher rents than ever before. As such, there islittle incentive on either side now to, say, build new homes at lower prices, because such action would be politically unpopular with voters. Instead, both sides seem intent onkeeping property values high, while making them less affordable forordinary people. In short, we see what happens when politicians get their way. They don’t care about any other considerations, including whether people actually want houses built now. It’s all just part of, well, politics.

But what exactly is it about this country and its people that... well, makes them vulnerable? And how does our government respond when we are at risk?

1251,How much of your body is your own?,"[""News How much of your body is your own? \n A. I think the whole point is, if you look at my body, it's a lot more than mine. It's all about me. I'm not just some guy who has his own body. And so when people ask me what it feels like to be me, they don't really understand how different that is. But then again, that's why we do this show. We want them to. We're trying our best and we're going for it. That's part of, like, being in New York. You have these great opportunities but you're always looking over yourself because there's no one else there. You're never alone. So you've got to, as an actor, try harder on every single day -- whether or not, by doing that, you'll get better. If anything, it'll help you. Because once something goes wrong, which can happen with any show, there are things wrong everywhere. Even though everything's been great, sometimes life throws us curveballs. Sometimes life's gonna throw you, too. It doesn't mean everything will go wrong. The show gives its audience hope even during tough times. When somebody gets hurt, everyone cries. Everybody wants someone else. There's nothing better feeling knowing that. So, yeah, I've had moments where I'd feel bad 'cause I'll see other actors crying after their performances, especially women. They say, 'Hey, man, did he hurt you?' Or they'll say 'I was hurt.' All those kinds things. They're saying stuff out loud right now, they're talking through it, telling each other. That makes everybody happy. People cry from time totime. There were times where, before we'd come into work, they'd already cried together. They'd cry, 'Oh, he's hurting!' Then you'd think, 'Well, let's make him better,' right? Let's take care about. Let go. Make sure he'll heal him. Give 'em up. Don't let go, man. He's hurt. We'll heal. He needs help. Do whatever hurts us. What would break up front. To know what's important stuff. Just give up, put ourselves down deep. Some days away. In order in. Those kind of. Why can't wait till then. For him, really. Yeah. Get back down. This isn't enough. These guys need more. What's left out. Like, 'I'm here now. Maybe not. 'Cause we've got. Not enough already. Is anybody else? Everything's worth everything. Everything counts. Every little bit extra. Can anyone else's gotta give..... Well, maybe nothing. No one's gone. Where does it? Who cares? Are you? No. 1 thing here. My heart out, 2 minutes ago. One second. Does anything left. Somebody's missing. Everybody's important. Nothing more? Anyway. Who's yours? Okay, sometimes? Take care. Your heart. Which means something. Now what? Whatever. Life is...''

The biggest challenge for all these kinds of, well, disasters in our world today are people and infrastructure. We have had some pretty horrific events that we could not recover from. And so it was important -- I think it\'s even more critical now than ever before because we\'re going into space. So what happens when something goes wrong on one side or another side? You can\'t just turn off your lights at night anymore. If you\'re trying to, say, get somebody out from under rubble that\'s been blown away, there\'s no electricity there. There has got be power somewhere. But if you\'ve damaged something, then how can they go back in? That\'s where this kind of... This sort of-- These things will always happen as long as, like, satellites don\'t fall out. It\'s like saying, \'We\'re moving toward Mars. Let\'s take care whatever damage we\'ve done there.\'\'\' He added, \'\'We\'ve made progress over time but still haven\'t gotten anywhere.\'\' As he spoke, his voice grew increasingly desperate. In fact, NASA officials were beginning their own investigation about whether debris might actually hit them. Mr. Kennedy said that, while most experts agree such collisions would cause only minor damage, others say large pieces may strike down upon Earth. A small piece falling near Mars could, potentially, wipe us out, too. It happened during Apollo 11, which killed seven astronauts.

I think it\'s just because we\'re so far away from everything. It\'s nice that they let us live here.\'\' He added, however, he was concerned about what would happen if there were another terrorist attack. In fact, it is already happening. A few days ago, an unexploded bomb exploded outside his apartment, destroying one window but leaving no serious damage. On Friday night, two men armed with machetes attacked him as soon after 9 p.m. They took everything -- including some personal items belonging only by right or obligation (socks, underwear, books) left on tables at nearby restaurants before closing. One man even stole $100. And when police officers arrived minutes later, both had been arrested. It seems unlikely any more bombs will be set off here.
