"" how can that be possible! "" \n he nods solemnly. "" i\'m sorry. "" \n "" no, not really, "" i tell him quickly. "" i mean, it makes sense now : your mom would have been killed by some kind of meteor or other if she \'d gotten too close to our home base. but why would someone want to kill my dad? "" \n "" he was working undercover in afghanistan, trying to find information on terrorists. "" \n "" oh. okay. "" i swallow hard. "" that explains everything. "" \n ben shakes his head slowly. "" actually, it doesn\'t explain anything. it only explained why your parents\'deaths could never happen again. "" \n i look away, suddenly feeling very tired. "" so all these lies you told me - you lied to protect yourself from me? "" \n he stares down into his coffee cup. "" yes. i thought it might make things easier, since i knew you would hate me even more once you found out what i am. but i guess you already figured that out. "" \n i sigh heavily, staring up at the ceiling, thinking about how much worse this whole situation will get if he tells me. "" you should\'ve said something sooner. i would\'ve listened to any explanation i wanted. "" \n he glances over at me. "" do you think i made a mistake telling you all of this? "" \n "" no,']"

"" \n she didn\'t answer right away. instead, her eyes narrowed and then she looked down at the ground as if to hide behind a wall or something. i could tell that it was difficult for her not to look up into my face. \n finally, after what felt like an eternity, she said in a small voice, "" yes. "" \n "" good girl! now we can talk about you. who are you really? where do you come from? why have you been here all these years? "" \n her head snapped back toward me with surprise. "" oh... um.... well, this whole time i\'ve just assumed that everyone else knew who i am because they were always so sure of themselves. but, no one ever told anyone before. nobody even asked questions. "" \n i nodded slowly. "" okay, well let\'s start over again. when i first came out here i thought that people would think that i\'m some kind of freak who has lost my mind. i mean, you know, the way i feel sometimes when someone looks at me. it doesn\'t make sense, though. "" \n "" yeah, i guess it probably shouldn\'t. "" she shrugged. "" but anyway, it seems pretty obvious that there must be more than two hundred kids around here somewhere. maybe hundreds. it makes total sense that most likely there \'ll be thousands.

"" wow, thanks. that sounds great. "" \n "" hey, "" she continued quickly, "" i meant it when i said that i \'d only seen humans once before today. it was during my last visit to earth and they had brought me here. i saw them in the park earlier tonight. "" \n "" wait, you\'re talking about the same place you found us on our journey through space? "" \n "" yep, that\'s the spot. "" \n "" oh... cool...

"" i haven\'t been here long enough to get used to it yet, but i\'m pretty sure the maintenance people are on their way now and they \'ll be able to help us with whatever needs doing in this place. "" \n he nodded his head slowly as if considering her words before saying, "" let\'s go check out your room first. we can talk there then. "" \n she followed him into what was obviously an old - fashioned bedroom that had no windows or doors. it looked like someone who \'d lived in one of those luxury hotels for years must have spent time at some point during his life. the bed was made up in bright colors and black silk sheets were spread over white pillows and blankets. \n when he opened the door to reveal another small bathroom off to the side, emma gasped again. she walked inside and stared around in awe. there was even more than just a shower stall and several sinks. everything about the room screamed money! \n "" wow! look at all these rooms, "" she said, walking back towards him to take a closer inspection. "" where did you find so much stuff? "" \n dimitri laughed softly. "" my father has always wanted me to own something large, but since my mother died, he decided not to give me any money until after i graduated from college. he never thought it would come down to my being wealthy enough to buy anything else. "" \n "" why is that? "" \n he took her hand in both of his and led her through the house, stopping once outside the kitchen area which held two huge stainless steel appliances, three ovens and four refrigerators. "" because i love cooking, "" he explained simply. \n she shook her head. "" no wonder you\'re such good cook. "" \n he smiled slightly and pulled open a cabinet. "" this will work fine. "" pulling out a pot and spatula, he turned to face her. "" please tell me you\'ve cooked dinner already tonight?

"" we\'re not going back there. that\'s why it was so important for us to get out of here before they found me or killed all those people who were trying to kill you... because if someone had seen what happened to your family when you left this morning, then they would have been able to track down any other survivors from your past. "" \n i shook my head slowly. "" no! "" i cried, tears welling up again as i stared at him with horror written across every inch of my skin. i didn\'t know how long i could keep doing this ; i just knew that i needed time to process everything that had occurred today. i wanted nothing more than to go home and crawl under my covers and never come out until things settled down enough for me to think clearly once more. but even though i felt like an idiot, i still managed to hold myself together by sheer will power alone. i tried hard not to show fear, especially now that cade stood beside me, looking completely confident in himself and our future. \n "" bethany? are you ok? "" bret inquired softly. \n i nodded absently, unable to respond. cade placed one hand on top of mine as he squeezed gently. "" do you want some water bethy? "" jenna asked quietly. \n i glanced around nervously, searching desperately for something that might help ease her fears. she seemed oblivious to them, unaware of their presence, yet she kept glancing over toward cade, her gaze darting briefly to me before returning to lloyd. i swallowed heavily, hating the fact that she saw him like this, hated knowing that i caused it. i wished i could tell her that bret would be fine, but i doubted that she \'d believe me anyway. \n "" yes please, "" abby said briskly. \n i took a deep breath as darnell handed me two bottles of cold coke. it tasted awful, but it helped clear away the lingering effects of yesterday. my stomach rumbled loudly, reminding everyone that dinner should\'ve already started. \n aiden came forward and grabbed another bottle from darnell.

"" oh my goodness! what\'s going on? is everything okay here? did something happen that requires your immediate presence right now or can someone please tell us what happened?

"" turning to nick, she added, "" and since the last time i saw either of you was after dinner at the restaurant where we were having dessert, i think you need to go ahead and give mr. hamilton some space. "" \n nick stepped closer to emma and whispered against her ear, "" don\'t worry about anything. just stay close to me and let me handle things here. "" \n emma felt herself blushing furiously. she had never seen such blatant male possessiveness in any person before. even though he \'d only known her a few days, he seemed completely possessive of her. maybe it was because he knew how much it bothered her that brant had called him out. whatever the reason, she found herself wanting to see nick hurt. not once during the past week had he ever shown signs of being emotionally involved with another female. so why should he care whether her relationship status improved with declan? \n chapter twenty - four \n brant stood outside his office door waiting impatiently for ava to come through. he hated waiting. if he hadn\'t already gone into work early enough, he might have missed seeing ava walk inside. he watched as she paused at the top step and glanced around as if searching for someone. she finally stopped moving and gave him a small smile as she approached. she reached out to touch his cheek lightly and he leaned towards']"
