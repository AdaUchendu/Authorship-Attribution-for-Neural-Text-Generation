The latest developments include: The Obama administration announced that it plans to push state and local governments to make available more fuel-efficient vehicles to help the growing auto industry. The Obama administration will make $50 million available in the next six months for fuel-efficient passenger cars. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz says the department expects to sell about 80,000 electric cars and plug-in hybrids by 2017. The U.S. government will continue to offer tax credits for electric cars to help consumers buy more fuel-efficient vehicles. The U.S. auto industry is facing a looming cash crunch due to a lack of credit and rising costs. The government's Energy Information Administration said Wednesday the average price of a gallon of regular is $3.50. The new vehicle tax credit will be extended through March, which will help spur U.S. car sales. The average price of a gallon of regular is $3.36. An auto company claims the credit from the government. The company that manufactures the Ford Focus said it will offer the credit to as many as 12,000 dealers. The company says it is the first time the credit has been provided. The Ford Focus was launched in October 2008. Ford Motor Co. is changing its name to Ford Motor Company Holden.

1,"China wants to take a victory lap over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. On Tuesday, the Chinese Health Ministry announced it would continue to monitor the situation at the Sanaa International Airport. The airport has been closed since late November, and the city's last Ebola patient, a New York doctor, died on Tuesday at a hospital. The city's hospitals have been on heightened alert in recent days. The World Health Organization said on Tuesday it was sending an additional 25 experts to Liberia to help combat the outbreak. It said that the coronavirus, which causes severe fever, vomiting, diarrhea and internal and external bleeding, is now spreading rapidly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. It has become a known problem in Guinea, which has never before witnessed an outbreak of the virus outside Africa. The WHO said on Tuesday that it would send a team of scientists to Sierra Leone to assess the threat of the virus there. The team was expected to visit schools and hospitals and provide information to the health authorities, the WHO said. As of Tuesday, the WHO had about 1,400 people it would need to contact. The virus is already spreading rapidly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The outbreak has so far sickened 2,036 people and killed more than 1,400, the WHO said. Doctors Without Borders, the international aid group, said that it had isolated more than 50 new cases of the virus over the past few days, and that more patients were being tested for the virus. It said it would monitor the situation closely. ""We believe this is an escalating situation,"" said Jonathan Paye, a spokesman for the group. The health authorities are now doing their utmost to minimize the impact on civilians. ""We would like to warn people not to go to areas where there is a large outbreak,"" Ms. Paye said. We ask people to be very cautious about visiting these areas. Dr. Paye said that the worst of the outbreak remained in the city of Odienne, where some schools and houses had been inundated since Nov. Local health officials had told Reuters that the epidemic was not yet under control. The hospital in Odienne was not the only one in the city to be hit. The Ebola outbreak in Guinea spread to Conakry, the capital, and other affected areas in neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone, and the United Nations said on Wednesday that it was concerned that the outbreak"
2,"Coronavirus disinformation creates challenges for China's government 2 (Xinhua) -- The spread of coronavirus in China is hampering the development of a vaccine against the infection, according to a report on the ministry of public health. Meanwhile, a report on the case of a woman in the southern province of Guangdong who contracted the virus two weeks ago has found that the person infected had no contact with her since the start of January. The unnamed woman with the vaccine, who had been in the city of Anhui, in Jilin Province, was also unaware that she had contracted the virus, which is a rare disease in China and afflicts about 10 million people. She contacted the authorities and said she had not been vaccinated against coronavirus because she had not used a needle or had been able to come into contact with her person who had started to show symptoms. The case occurred after her sister, who also had a virus, underwent surgery for a severe heart issue. The hospital report also said the woman was working in another city after the surgery, but that the hospital said she had not been able to contact her employer about her illness. Last month, a 52-year-old woman whose surname was not disclosed was diagnosed with the virus in Anhui, according to the report. At least four people have died from the virus in China in the first two weeks after it was first reported in Anhui. A total of 48 people have come down with the virus and eight have died, according to the Ministry of Public Health. The official cause of the virus has not been determined. Symptoms of the disease include fever, muscle aches and pneumonia. The virus can be transmitted by coughing or sneezing, or by touching infected secretions such as doorknobs or surfaces. All cases have been treated with antibiotics and the virus has not spread to the general public. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends testing for coronavirus in all residents who work with children, pregnant women and people who have not reported any of their family members to the health authorities. China, the World Health Organization (WHO) says the disease is the most serious health threat facing humanity. The virus is spread through close contact with infected birds and animals, such as humans. It is also sometimes transmitted through contact with contaminated food or water."
3,"China coronavirus: Eating wild animals made illegal but ending the trade won't be easy A pig carcass at a farm in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen on August 20, 2012. Beijing: China's main animal health authorities have banned the consumption and sale of wild animals, including horses. The decision by the State Food and Drug Administration came after it had warned that wild animals could also suffer from the deadly coronavirus. This week, China's top leaders met in Hangzhou to discuss the issue and it is estimated that almost six million animals are slaughtered each year in China, with many pets brought to hastily destroyed hospitals by the disease. The Hangzhou meeting on animal health, announced by the China Economic Daily newspaper on Friday, called for the ""closing down of all wild animals that could be brought into the country."" It said that animals must be kept for human consumption, which in turn would prevent their digestive organs from rejecting the food. The officials also expressed concern over the loss of livestock to the virus, saying that a shortage of antibiotics and vaccines would keep the disease from spreading. The meeting was chaired by Premier Li Keqiang and included the China National Agriculture and Food Administration, the China Food and Drug Administration, the State Council, the State Council, the State Council Information Office and the Ministry of Commerce. The meeting did not identify the countries that would be affected. Last month, China banned the sale of some pork and pork products to the United States, saying they can carry the disease. ""The United States is not the only country outside the region where people can get sick from this virus,"" EARC spokesman Alex Yan told Reuters on Thursday. Eating wild animals is a tradition in China and is regarded as an important part of the country's religious culture. A number of US hospitals have reported having to treat wild animals, including people who died from the disease after eating the animals. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are about 20,000 cases of the virus every year. Eating wild animals is not illegal in China. Those who are infected are not considered to be pets and could face fines if they are found to have infected their animals. However, China's strict enforcement of animal welfare laws has meant that restaurants and markets that sell wild animals in China are increasingly overcrowded, and often dangerous."
4,"China's economy could shrink for the first time in decades because of the coronavirus, which is spread by close contact with infected blood or secretions of faeces or saliva. The virus, which has a fatality rate of about 40 percent, has spread globally to more than 20 countries. China is the world's top importer of raw materials for pharmaceuticals and meat, and has been slow to step up its fight against the virus, which can cause life-threatening ailments in the developing world. But on Saturday, the Ministry of Health released figures showing a slight fall in new cases, but an overall drop in deaths. Health officials did not say how many people had been infected by the disease, or release the actual number. The virus originated in Vietnam and infected dozens of people in China, where it is known to be widespread. In Hong Kong, the number of new infections had dropped. Four people died there from the virus last year, and two in a local hospital, said Michael Tong, spokesman for the Hong Kong Department of Health. But on Saturday, the Ministry of Health said that the number of new infections fell to 16 over the past week, with the province reporting two new cases in the past week. The city's health department said that five people had died from the virus since late June. The government has been stepping up testing of travelers at Hong Kong airport and at nearby Shenzhen International Airport, in addition to its efforts to control the spread of the virus, which is transmitted through coughing and sneezing, and who has been in close contact with infected passengers. The government has also been urging airlines to screen passengers for the virus that has been detected in China. Mr. Tong said the government was making efforts to prevent the spread of the virus elsewhere in the world. In a statement, the World Health Organization said in a statement that there was no confirmed case of the virus in Hong Kong. ""It is difficult to predict how the virus may affect Hong Kong, but it is very difficult to say whether it will affect the rest of the world,"" it said. The C.D.C. said the Hong Kong cases had involved people who traveled to and from China. The virus had also been found at a military base in Hong Kong, but no trace was found there, the C.D.C. said. There were a total of 10 cases in five of China's nine provinces."
5,"China and Japan's budding relationship in the time of coronavirus A person passes through a coronavirus in the Beijing Olympic Park in 2008. A new study suggests that Japan's new leader, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, is unlikely to be persuaded to make a swift ""correction"" in his insistence on fiscal stimulus and reconstruction spending, and not to follow the example of China, which is being challenged by economic contraction and rising Chinese debt. The new study published last week in Archives of Disease in Childhood by Harvard University's Chan & Woo Lin and colleagues found that China's economy would need to grow by about 10 per cent per year to meet Japan's growth target of 5 per cent. China's growth rate would require a growth rate of only 3.1 per cent, said the authors, led by Yu Qiang of Harvard's School of Foreign Service and the Japan Institute of Development. They calculated that Japan's GDP would expand by almost 5 per cent, or an additional $380bn, based on the new numbers. Japan is facing a significant budget deficit, so the findings are relevant to Abe, who will be sworn in on Friday. ""China has been challenging Japan's growth assumptions for a long time,"" said the authors, who were joined by Jeffrey Wasserstrom, Michael Byng, and Ken Takahashi of Harvard's Langston Hughes School of Government. They concluded, however, that China would be underestimated in the long run in the short term, given that it would need to endure low inflation, near-zero growth and ""strong external demand."" ""Compounding the challenge of fiscal stimulus and fiscal repair are the challenges that Japan faces in a post-war world,"" the authors said. However, China continues to offer the alternative to policies which have produced very low growth. They added: ""The study demonstrates that China's fiscal policy needs to be reformed in order to meet its growth targets."" The authors highlighted China's efforts to improve its digestive system, which they said is still a ""neglected"" part of its infrastructure, and encouraged Japan to move more quickly. ""The study also supports China's efforts to transform its development model,"" it said. The findings provided a reminder to Japan that China's economy had not reached full employment levels yet, the authors said. This article is based on research by researchers at Harvard University's School of"
6,"Coronavirus is fast becoming an 'economic pandemic' There is a ""strong"" economic case for controlling the spread of the human coronavirus (CMV), according to a leading public health expert. The highly contagious virus has now become a ""financial pandemic"" with up to 100 million people suffering from the disease by mid-2018, according to Professor Chris Ham, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He said the emergence of the disease is causing ""unprecedented"" damage to health systems and infrastructure, with the international community ""running out of options"" and a new influenza pandemic needed to be ""dealt with immediately."" Scientists have now identified the mosquito which is responsible for the outbreak and are looking at ways to control it as well as trace the source to where it came from. The virus is highly infectious and can cause severe illness in those most at risk. However, in some cases, it can be passed on to others, including people who have recently had a dental procedure. Professor Ham said that there is a strong case for controlling the virus as long as it is contained. ""We can't, for example, stop a person doing what he or she wants to do,"" he said. It's not going to happen. If people are at serious risk of having a CMV outbreak, there is an important lesson to be learnt, so that we stop people getting the infection and if it is not stopped it will be much worse in future. It is not a pandemic. It is now a financial pandemic with economic consequences for the population. Professor Ham added that the strain of the virus, which causes joint pain and fever, could be as serious as the new Ebola scare, which has seen one person die in Nigeria and three have been infected in the UK. He said there were also ""worrying indications"" that the outbreak is spreading through hospitals and healthcare centres around the world. A number of countries have reported increased cases of the illness, including the US, Italy, Germany and Spain. Professor Ham said: ""We are now in the position where we have to say to the public,' We have to be prepared, we have to be prepared and we have to take action now '."" The current outbreak in South America will be most significant in South America, where people have had a high number of cases."
7,"A history of Wuhan, one-time Chinese capital and coronavirus epicenter HONG KONG - The city that was once Asia's top manufacturing hub and was once a magnet for medical student students and engineers is now China's top exporter. The number of highly polluting cars and trucks in China has plummeted by half in recent years, and has reached a total of 2.2 million - making it the world's third largest market after the U.S. and Europe. But Wuhan's growth is fading. The city's population has swelled from just over 1.5 million in the 1950s to more than 4.4 million today. In 2005, the city's population soared from only 30,000 to around 500,000. In 2009, the city's population fell from around 300,000 to just 6,000. In Wuhan's case, that number has shrunk to around 50,000 now. Dr. Xu Qingquan, a professor in the school of political science at Hangzhou university, said it's not just the factories that are under pressure. ""Our main concern is pollution,"" he said. We have to do a better job in controlling the air. In a study published in the scientific journal Science, the researchers found that there was a reduction of nearly 37% in the number of pollutants in the air. ""China has a tremendous amount of pollution, so it's really under pressure to improve it,"" said Jonathan Shirk, a researcher at the Center for Global Development, who co-authored the study with Dr Xu. ""Some of that pollution is directly attributable to emissions from industries that are operating under very high standards,"" he said. It's not just factories, but ports, factories, ports all are in serious trouble. It's a very wide-ranging problem. The study found that pollution from many industries is most prevalent in industrial areas in China as well as in low-income areas. The overall percentage of pollutants measured by the World Health Organization in 2009 rose to 39% from 37% in 1970. That's down from 47% in 1970. But China's new leader, Xi Jinping, has promised to tackle pollution. He's vowed to clean up some of China's dirtiest cities, including Beijing, where the government is taking steps to improve air quality. He's even announced a goal to eliminate the country's smog from the air by 2030."

9,"Chinese diplomat promotes conspiracy theory that US military brought virus to Wuhan Caijing Magazine reported that a source in the US government gave a secret warning that there were microcephaly cases in Wuhan and that the Chinese authorities were planning on destroying the mosquitoes that carry Zika. As Chinese news outlets have been reporting in recent days, the US government has revealed that it conducted surveillance flights over parts of China to monitor suspected cases of Zika in April. Wuhan, in China's central Hubei province, is the spiritual home of the Chinese military, which has been reeling from the controversy over the spread of the Zika virus during its World War II battle. In the past 12 months, the virus has disrupted the distribution of mosquito larvae in Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, Panama, and Peru. However, the virus has not been completely eradicated. In an article published in Xinhua, the Chinese diplomat said that the virus was created by the United States as a ""political cudgel"" against China. ""We can't keep an individual from wanting to spread the virus,"" he said. The Chinese diplomat was referring to the United States, where President Barack Obama has proposed putting a $300 million buffer on the $3.8 billion in annual military aid to the South American nation's military. The military spending comes as American military leaders have been working to keep the virus from spreading to other countries. Most of the US budget requests for that year included $13 billion in funding for the military's anti-Zika response. The US military has been using the money to beef up its response, with the department's chief of staff Gen. Ray Odierno telling Reuters last week that the military has already completed a $224 million effort to fight Zika. The US is also moving forward with a $4.6 billion study to identify Zika virus threats in the blood of infected males, as well as in the body. The current Zika virus outbreak has infected more than 3,000 people worldwide since it first emerged in Brazil in March. It is unclear how long this outbreak will continue to spread in the US. There have been reported cases in Canada and at least 10 in Spain. The World Health Organization has said it expects the virus to spread to other countries in the Western Hemisphere, although most of the cases have been in Latin America. CNN's Kevin Wang and Pamela Boykoff contributed to this report."
10,"Putin and Xi are using the coronavirus crisis to extend their control. Across the world, Trump is struggling to keep up with the anti-virus crisis. He has ordered his federal agencies to step up efforts to combat it and to warn of new threats. In Washington, Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said on Monday the U.S. government had seen signs of the bug and that countries in the Middle East were on high alert. According to the World Health Organization, there are more than 1.9 billion people who are infected with the deadly virus, and it is spread by tiny droplets through sex or coughing. It is unclear how many of the countries affected are vaccinated against the virus, and many are reluctant to vaccinate their people. The United States has ordered military personnel to help contain the outbreak. In an attempt to get more medical workers at its borders, the State Department on Monday began asking the United States' Defense Department for help. The department also asked international medical organizations to supply more beds and medical kits to help with the outbreak. The State Department declined to say how many beds it would need. The World Health Organization has warned the illness could be transmitted through contaminated surfaces such as doorknobs, faucets, door handles and door handles. It said that without prompt action, the disease could begin to spread. That means that even if the U.S. authorities don't find the source of the virus, the U.S. health care system could be in trouble. The Trump administration has already begun to restrict travel to the United States, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has not said whether he will lift the country's travel ban on travelers from six mostly Muslim countries. The Department of Homeland Security said on Monday that it has suspended the processing of visas from the six countries, and it has also sent a letter of warning to U.S. citizens about the outbreak. It said that people who had made trips to the affected countries should contact their airlines. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday that it had sent 10 million doses of Tamiflu to the regions hardest hit by the virus, citing experts' predictions of a 60 percent chance the virus would spread to the U.S. The CDC said the number of cases could rise. The World Health Organization said it expected the disease to become a major global emergency by the end of the year, with more than 60 percent of the cases being experienced in West Africa."
11,"How this South Korean company created coronavirus test kits in three weeks We've all been treated to a ""coronavirus scare"" during the summer. Whether you're a student studying in the UK or a medical student studying in South Korea, coronavirus is one thing: it has a reputation for bringing a deadly epidemic to the masses. However, this week's news that a South Korean company has developed a new diagnostic tool for the virus may just be the most shocking sign yet that the virus is thriving. The company behind the KVWR, which allows researchers to test a patient's immune system using a high-tech machine, has developed a range of coronavirus vaccines. These include the mammal vaccine containing the virus, which is designed to replicate the mutated H5N1 strain in humans. The mammal vaccine contains a protein that influences how the virus spreads. It also contains a number of other molecules and genetic modifications that can lead to the virus spreading to humans - something that is not currently possible. The MMR vaccine contains a number of molecules that can influence the virus, which one of the researchers behind the KVWR has described as ""a new milestone"" in the development of new vaccines. This research may also help researchers in the US develop a new vaccine for the disease - which, according to The Independent, could be ready within weeks. The KVWR technique only functions on individual cells, but it does not require an immunisation programme of any kind. It is likely to be used by researchers in other countries as well. The company was founded in the South Korean city of Taehei in 2014 by Hwang Hyok, a former researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. According to The Independent, Hwang and his colleagues hope it will be able to develop a vaccine for a virus that is more likely to cause a disease than a simple virus. ""It's not a virus,"" Hwang says, ""but a virus that is in the gut."" Coronaviruses are caused by a range of viruses, including some that cause cervical cancer, pneumonia, influenza, multiple organ failure, and the common cold.

13,"Coronavirus could hurt Boeing more than the 737 Max crisis Coronavirus may hurt aerospace giant Boeing more than the 737, according to a new study. The study, by JMU Professors Mark Baird and Matthew Riley, found that if the virus hits jet fuel, it could increase the risk of jet fuel leaks by up to 50 percent. While Boeing has offered no evidence to support the claims, some experts have also questioned the data. ""The data suggest that the coronavirus is not just contagious but is highly lethal,"" said Mike McAllister, a University of Maryland professor emeritus of transportation science. Coronaviruses aren't just a contagious health threat, but have been linked to avian flu emergencies in the past. And they can spread more quickly between people, despite the fact that most people are aware that the virus can cause severe respiratory illness. ""There's not much we can do to protect our airplanes and engines,"" said Dr. Robert Pastukowski, executive director of the World Health Organization's Center for Infectious Diseases and Global Health. However, he said he's encouraged by the research and had ""great confidence"" in the results. ""The message from this research is that we can do something for our bodies to protect themselves,"" Pastukowski said. But he cautioned that ""there's a way to go"" with the research. ""We need to do a better job of educating workers about this virus in order to make sure they are taking part. The study, published in the online edition of the journal Cell Host and Microbe, assessed the health status of 737 employees from the U.S. and around the world, and found that 30 percent experienced either severe respiratory illness or severe illness in the past week. Boeing has said that it had a team of scientists in the Netherlands and is working with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to find more information about the virus. Boeing's 737 Max is one of the first plane-making aircraft in the world. The plane is a big seller. The new study found that people that had chronic respiratory illnesses were more likely to suffer symptoms such as coughing and sneezing than those who were healthy.

14,"Hong Kong protests: How unrest criminalized a generation The Hong Kong government has launched an investigation into police practices during demonstrations last year to see if evidence of police brutality was used during the crackdown. Demonstrators protested against the government's ban on candidates from mainland China being vetted by Hong Kong's Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying. But according to a report published on Monday, police used pepper spray, pepper spray, smoke grenades and tear gas to disperse demonstrators. Police officers also allegedly used excessive force against hundreds of pro-democracy protesters. Speaking to the BBC, Leung said his administration would make ""every effort to crack down"" on any wrongdoing that led to the violence. Speaking to the Associated Press, he said: ""The people feel that it's not a question of the police or us, it's about why they did what they did."" The Hong Kong government says the elections were legitimate, but the BBC reported that there were allegations of fraud and intimidation, with protest organisers saying they were beaten by police. Protesters say they were assaulted while trying to clear the route of a cross-border rail station in the Admiralty district of Hong Kong. During the protest, there were clashes between police and demonstrators, with buildings being pepper sprayed and tear gas used. In December, more than 100 people were hurt in clashes between police and demonstrators at a rally in the city. Video of the incident was widely shared on social media. The police claim that more than 500 people were arrested during the violent clashes, while in February, more than 400 protesters were injured after a group of about 500 protesters clashed with police. A small number of people have been arrested for public order offenses after the clashes. Protesters are calling for a full investigation into the police. Demonstrators are calling for a full investigation of the police and the Hong Kong government. Demonstrators in Hong Kong call for freedom of speech, but police use pepper spray to disperse demonstrators. According to the Hong Kong government, they are seeking a broader inquiry into police use of force. They said further investigation would reveal if the police used excessive force. About 2,000 people were arrested during the march. CNN's Ben Westcott, Kristina Sgueglia, Michael Martinez and James Griffiths contributed to this report.

15,"Christmas in Hong Kong marked by demonstrations and tear gas The annual holiday in Hong Kong has been marked by events to mark the first anniversary of the Chinese Communists seizing the city's economic and political control in 1997. Thousands of protesters gathered to celebrate after the Chinese Communist Party came to power and many people took to the streets of the city to demonstrate against the Chinese Communist Party. Many people chanted ""Long live the Chinese Communist Party"" and ""Long live the Chinese Communist Party."" One Chinese man carried a sign reading: ""Hang the Communist Party."" Many people waved flags and sang patriotic songs. Protesters gathered in Hong Kong as well. Beijing has said it will review the territory's political framework and legal systems to ensure that Hong Kong is seen as a fully independent country. The demonstrations began in late July. They have since evolved into a broader call for universal suffrage. The BBC's Chris Hogg in Hong Kong says the protests have become a test of China's rule over the city. The unrest in Hong Kong began after the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1997. While Communist Party leaders have been cracking down on dissent and suppressing pro-democracy demonstrators, they have also warned of a possible crackdown on those who break the law. Thousands of people are expected to take part in a peaceful protest in the city centre later on Friday. What is the most popular holiday in Hong Kong?

Hong Kong's government has dismissed reports that Beijing has decided to offer direct talks with the protesters and urged them to live up to their pledges to protect the city's ""autonomy and sovereignty."" Last month the former British colony was handed back to China by Beijing after more than two decades of civil unrest. The move followed a series of meetings hosted by President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang. Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it remains under the control of Beijing. Beijing has ruled the city since 1949. Hong Kong remains under intense Chinese control, with the rule of law and a heavy police presence. There are fears about the rise of nationalism in the city, which has seen a surge of activism in recent years.

16,"New arts district aims to brighten Chennai community's dark reputation The district centre will house more than 400 educational spaces, as well as the Kasikori gallery. Photo: Anurag Kashyap The district centre for Chennai in the Indian state of Jharkhand has been opened to the public - and to the community as a whole. The town's new arts district launched on Monday, aims to brighten Chennai's ""dark reputation"" as an ""eyesore,"" reports the Hindustan Times. In recent years, the district centre has become a place to congregate. But a new building with a focus on education has also been created to attract students and tourists, and a new library has also been built. According to the district centre's administrator, Arati Srinivasan, the new arts district will not only transform Chennai's image, but also create a ""better sense of belonging in the town."" The project, which also includes an entertainment district, is expected to lead to an increase in tourists and foreign investment, especially in the area. The district centre will open to the public on Monday and will be run by the Centre for Music, Arts and Culture, an arm of the Jharkhand state government, which is responsible for the area. The Kasikori gallery, which will also serve as a hub for arts performances, will also have a permanent exhibition space. ""It is a city that needs to open, to make a mark,"" says Srinivasan. There is too much red tape here, all of the bureaucracy, and the culture is lacking in Chennai. Jharkhand has a reputation for being really ugly, very sad, and it has been seen as a jewel of India. And a lot of people don't like that, ""he added. Chennai's education minister, RK Naik, has welcomed the new centre as an opportunity to attract tourists."" It was a new district centre which opened with a big project, and is starting to create a stronger sense of belonging in Chennai, ""Naik told the Hindustan Times. It is a city that needs to open.

17,"From east Paris to world fame -- how imagination and travel fueled Christian Louboutin's success in Paris Christian Louboutin's work in France will be on display this month at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Paris. In a series of exhibitions, the British designer celebrates his 25 years in Paris. The exhibition, ""Music of Paris: A Tribute to His Unfinished Year,"" will run from May 18-July 3. It wraps up with the first of Louboutin's solo fashion shows -- a collection of suits and knitted socks that looks as if Louboutin has come full circle. Although the show was curated by the designer, his own show has been running for nearly 20 years. Louboutin's solo show drew about 30,000 people to Paris' Place de la Concorde, a monument to the city's architectural heritage. The show - which included a piano lesson from American pianist and film composer John Williams -- is part of a larger project by Louboutin to promote his work in his native country. The exhibition has been in Paris for two years. Louboutin's ""Music of Paris"" shows are sold around the world, including in London, New York and Tokyo. It's been a big year for Louboutin. He won a silver medal in the ""Best International Designer of the Year"" for his work at the London 2012 Olympics. In addition to his international success, Louboutin has created a vast array of collections, and the designer is the master of creating the perfect outfit. The show is open at the Institute of Contemporary Art, 790 Eighth Avenue, New York, until July 22. Tickets cost $150, but in 2011 the Paris museum offered tickets to watch the show at its outdoor museum -- ""Paris is not Paris."" If you want to see Louboutin's work, there's a tour of the exhibition Friday and Saturday, May 19 and 20 -- admission is free. Info: Paris Louboutin Institute of Contemporary Art, 1 Place de la Concorde, Paris; 209-961-3553. It's open to the public every Thursday night from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Friday and Saturday, and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday. All photos taken in Paris.

18,"12 famous buildings in India: From ancient wonders to modern marvels The Maharaja Gandhi International Historic Park is a Unesco World Heritage Site, and was created in 1932 by India's former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. A collection of 15 historic buildings, including the Imperial Palace and several palaces, and a large, ancient fort are still being restored in the park, which includes the Mahabharata Palace. The park is home to the world's largest collection of archaeological finds, including artefacts from the 16th century, the first written scriptures and the first printed reports of the great Mahatma Gandhi. The park was previously known as the Great Barrier Reef, but it was built using a combination of carbon, sand, and salt. It was also home to the Mahatma Gandhi Museum, which was built in the late 1830s. The park was named after the Mahatma Gandhi and was closed to the public in 1992 after a massive earthquake struck Nepal. It is also home to the Mahatma Gandhi Trust, which funds research into the history of the park and its impact on the environment. The park was created to promote environmental awareness. There are over three million people living in the park, of which less than 2% of whom are women. Image credit: Indian Ministry of Tourism and Sports via Storyful.

19,"Coronavirus: Which countries have travel bans? Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The UK is among the countries affected by the illness which has now spread to the Philippines The number of people affected by a highly contagious coronavirus outbreak in the Philippines has risen to nine. Most of the cases have occurred in Mexico and is believed to be spread by a mosquito carrying the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus was being spread in the same way as the 2009 SARS outbreak in China. However, the organisation stressed the need for continued vigilance in the case of the outbreak. In a statement, the WHO noted that there were cases in Spain and France. ""The WFP has already activated its emergency response teams to assist with the spread of this highly contagious virus, and they continue to monitor the situation and update the situation,"" the WHO said. The virus, which has killed more than 170 people since 2003, has been found in a number of regions of the world. China is one of those countries included in the WHO list of countries affected by the outbreak. In a statement, the WHO said: ""It is essential that the situation in countries affected does not become more dangerous."" Mexico has also reported two cases and there have been five in China, the WHO said. The number of cases in Peru rose from 20 to 17, while six cases were confirmed in the US. Earlier this month the WHO said further cases in the Philippines and Vietnam were expected. It said it was working with other countries ""to confirm and contain any further spread of the virus."" In the Philippines, more than 3,000 students have been affected. Most of the students have suffered headache, muscle pain, fever, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. The government has warned that the virus could infect up to two million people. The disease is contagious in the US through mosquitoes, mainly bites from the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carry Zika. Health experts say that the virus is more transmissible in the air than in soil. It can be passed from person to person through sexual contact. In 2014, a woman contracted the virus in Haiti, where she was admitted to hospital. The virus has spread through the Caribbean, spreading to Guadeloupe, the British Virgin Islands and the US Virgin Islands. It is also spreading through Mexico."
20,"Mount Everest closed over coronavirus fears Mount Everest has been closed due to fears of an outbreak of the deadly disease known as coronavirus. The Nepalese tourism ministry said the mountain's 850-metre-high Mount Everest was closed to climbers because of fears it was spreading, and to guide and carry out medical evacuations. The mountain is the highest and most highest peak in the world, and is regarded as one of the most sacred structures on earth. Coronavirus (Mers) is characterised by severe shortness of breath and fatigue, and is spread by infected animals such as animals. It is not airborne but can be carried by tiny droplets, which can pass from person to person so people do not become sick. In 2013, four British mountaineers died in a serious climbing accident on Mount Everest. The World Health Organisation, the United Nations and some European nations have warned of a potential threat to the entire world's mountain climbing infrastructure. Mers has been blamed on a lack of clean snow and poor sanitation in many camps, and there have been concerns that the disease could be transmitted by humans and could have been carried by rats or mice. The World Health Organisation has warned of a possible threat to the entire mountain climbing infrastructure. The area where the outbreak occurred is extremely remote in the Himalayas. Many bodies have been found there, while mountaineers have died due to the virus. It is also believed that rats and mice have infected people in many camps, and that the disease could have been carried by ""rats and mice."" Nepal is one of the world's poorest countries, where the health ministry says it has been unable to provide basic services to the 1.9m people who are currently living in poverty. Since the country's last measles outbreak, Mount Everest closed for three weeks in 2016. Coronaviruses are spread by sharing needles. They are not contagious at high altitude or from person to person. However, if a person has a temperature above 85ºC during the day, they may become infected with Mers. The WHO says that unless people are regularly washing their hands after using the bathroom, wearing long-sleeved clothing and using soap and water, and staying away from contaminated surfaces, it is impossible to know how far an outbreak of the illness has spread."

The party is on course to win more than 50 of the 92 lower house seats, which are up for grabs. But Tokyo 2020 officials have said that a decision to cancel the vote would not affect whether the 2024 Olympic Games are allowed to go ahead. The city of Tokyo is facing a $4.9bn budget deficit and has been shunned from the world's biggest sporting event. If the Games were cancelled, some people may have seen an opportunity for the Japanese government to save face.

Watch: The Japanese economy's recovery could be slower than previously thought, says JPMorgan China to cut China's credit interest rate by one percentage point from 6.1% to 6.0%, the first increase in over two years, which will help the world's second-largest economy improve its economic growth faster, according to officials. The central bank also said it would raise its reserve requirement ratio for banks to 10% and introduce more funds to the economy to counter the effects of the Chinese slowdown. China was forced to introduce a one trillion yuan (£896bn) stimulus package following its surprise decision to abandon a rate rise. The move was aimed at lifting growth, but it took months to unravel. Beijing has also been hit by a series of setbacks in its efforts to encourage more lending. The US Congress this week approved a $1.2bn (£9bn) stimulus package to help the country out of the downturn. However, analysts say the rate rises could be delayed or cancelled without any immediate effect on Beijing's economy. And new data from China's National Bureau of Statistics suggests the country's manufacturing sector is slowing, although the world's second biggest economy is doing well. Meanwhile, the value of China's currency, the yuan, has fallen by more than 20% since the start of the year. Also, the value of the Japanese yen has fallen by 15%, while the price of US dollars has risen by 13% The yen is currently trading at 116.41"
22,"Despite coronavirus concerns, Inter Milan president Steven Zhang confident Serie A season will be completed After a week in which Inter Milan were rocked by the virus, President Steven Zhang is confident that the Serie A season will be completed. The Brazil international was admitted to hospital on Monday with a severe acute respiratory infection. He was expected to stay in hospital for several days and return to Brazil for further tests. Following the virus, Zhang said in a statement: ""I am optimistic that the season will be complete. I am thankful that I do not have to leave hospital before the end of the season. I hope that the atmosphere will be positive for the players, the fans and Marina - and for the club. I have taken off my shirt and will return to my home on Tuesday. Zhang's statement added:"" In the next few days, I will be in Sao Paolo to get a clearer picture and assess the progress of the medical team here. I want to be sure that the team and our players go on to get it done, as I am sure they will. My own personal hope is that the season will be completed. I would like to thank all my players at Inter Milan for their patience and support. I thank them very much for having faith in me throughout this process. I wish the team and the fans well. I am sure they will now put their energies into helping me take care of my family. I wish each and every one of them a great season with Inter Milan. I thank you very much for the patience and support you have given me, I wish you every success in the future. Zhang also thanked his co-workers at the club. I am very thankful that I didn't tell anyone that I was going to be hospitalised before the end of the season. I have great respect for all of you, and the fans. I pray that you will receive the best possible care. I am hoping that you will take care of yourselves during this difficult time. I would also like to thank everyone at Inter Milan and Marina for your tremendous support over the past week. Thank you for all the love and support you have given me and I wish you every success in the future. I would also like to thank all the sponsors of the club, players and staff.

23,"Coronavirus threat to Tokyo 2020 is' heartbreaking, 'says surfer Kanoa Igarashi, known as ""Kanoa,"" has revealed that he is suffering from the coronavirus. The virus has now spread to almost half the population of Japan, and is already affecting a number of other major cities including Tokyo and Osaka. ""It's heartbreaking seeing the number of deaths, and the number of illness,"" Igarashi said. It's just devastating. I've had to learn to live with it. [Exposure to the virus] is very serious. I have this problem when I have to go to restaurants and when I have to go to the gym. I don't even know what else to do. The virus, which causes sore eyes, fever and muscle aches, has also affected people in the United States, France, the UK and the Netherlands. In April, a British surfer, who was infected, was hospitalised in Hawaii for a week. It is not known if his infection has affected other people in Japan. Igarashi, who said he suffered from it for many years, told the Guardian he has been in close contact with his surfing family, and that they have been at a level that he would not have expected to be exposed to the disease. ""I don't consider myself ill,"" he said. I don't think it's a major risk to the public. I think it's a simple matter of working with your doctor. I'm not that concerned. I'm not concerned about it. I think it's a virus. There is no vaccine or treatment for the disease, but experts say the best way to prevent it is to avoid touching your surfboards. If someone is sick they should wash their hands thoroughly, wash their hands frequently, and use hand sanitisers. They also said that if people are ill they should contact family members, close friends and friends, and put the virus in a bucket. The Japanese public health ministry advised people to avoid surfing outside of their homes or going indoors. It has also issued a warning to pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems to avoid contact with the virus. The World Health Organisation has warned that there is a ""high risk"" of the virus spreading to the US, Mexico and much of Southeast Asia. It is spread through contact with the blood or secretions of an infected individual, or contaminated surfboards."
24,"A state-by-state breakdown of US coronavirus cases shows that 21 states had confirmed cases of swine flu. Two have had more deaths and some 2,833 suspected cases of the virus as of Thursday. Seven people remain in hospital, one of them in a critical condition. The outbreak has hit the United States hard, with at least 7,543 confirmed cases, including around 430 deaths. The latest figure was released late Wednesday. The new figures are well below the total of 3,421 initial outbreaks, including 986 deaths, during last year's outbreak, when some 20 countries had reported their first cases. The government has been quick to blame the outbreak on human error, with a recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pointing to the fact that the virus can infect pigs for a number of reasons. Most of the outbreaks in the United States were traced to a specific strain of the virus, known as H1N1, but it has now spread to China. The latest data indicates that the virus is in a much better position to spread to the US, after other countries failed to detect the strain, said Dr David Heymann, an epidemiologist at the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The number of people infected with the disease has increased each week. Almost 35,000 people have contracted swine flu in the US, and more than 2,500 have died. Nearly a third of those who have been admitted to hospital have been in a critical condition, and about half have undergone treatment. The CDC said it was still in contact with a ""significant"" number of people who had been sickened by the strain that has infected them. The outbreak began in Mexico and spread to the US where it has since spread to Canada. Four people have been confirmed as having the disease in Mexico: a man from New York, a woman from California, an American from Texas and a Spaniard. More than half of those in hospital have been treated, but all have been discharged. A total of 4,763 people across the US have been infected but no deaths have been reported. Nearly all of those infected have been in Mexico, although some 4,457 Mexicans have been confirmed with the virus. The CDC has said that most cases of the disease have been in the US state of Texas, with 11 people infected in California and one in Texas."
25,"Why the impact of coronavirus could be particularly bad on college campuses While it's not exactly public health news that affects college campuses, the impact of the virus on campus is being closely watched. The CDC released a report this week to illustrate how much of the risk to college students comes from travel to places such as Mexico. This is the second year in a row that the CDC released a report on the virus. Previous estimates have put the impact at more than $5 billion. So what are the potential effects? Some believe the higher level of risk is because the virus lingers in the air around the campus. But another theory is the virus can persist in the environment, such as the air conditioning units. For instance, the CDC believes that the virus can survive in the air for up to a week after exposure to the air, and then dissipate. Other studies have also found the virus can linger for days or even weeks in the air. In fact, experts believe that the virus can live for up to six weeks when people are exposed to it. However, the CDC report said that since the virus is still circulating in the air near buildings, people are still most likely to fall ill and so people should cover their mouth and nose when they come into contact with the virus. However, the CDC also notes that while other studies have found that the virus can linger in the air for a long time, there is no way to tell how long the virus has lingered in the air. So why the effects of the virus may be more severe on college campuses? The CDC also recommends students not bring their school ID to the school. That means that students can't bring their school ID. And while students may not bring their school ID because of the virus they may bring it with them to the school. The CDC also says students should not bring their school ID if they are sick, because the virus can linger in the air for up to six weeks after exposure to the air. The CDC also recommends that students take their school identification with them. If a student is ill, they should take their school ID with them to a local hospital. Other school districts also have policies that limit the number of students per class when students are sick. The CDC says students must be in school for at least three days before they can bring their school ID. The CDC suggests that students should take all necessary precautions to ensure their health"
26,"Diplomat at the UN tests positive for coronavirus GENEVA (AP) - A diplomat at the United Nations is being taken to a Geneva hospital with a gastrointestinal infection and is suspected to have contracted the virus from the same source, the U.N. health agency said on Wednesday. The diplomat, who works in Switzerland, was hospitalized following his initial exposure to the Ebola virus on September 29. ""He has exhibited symptoms of the contagious disease in his contacts,"" the U.N. health agency said in a statement. ""He has been admitted to hospital as a precautionary measure for suspected infection,"" it said. The U.N. health agency has been monitoring the situation of the diplomat, who was the third person to contract the disease in connection with travel to West Africa, and the Ebola virus, a viral hemorrhagic fever that is spread through bodily fluids of infected people. The U.N. panel of experts is to visit the hospital to investigate the case. It is not known whether the diplomat is sick. The panel is to report back to the U.N. General Assembly on September 24. The World Health Organization said on Tuesday that the number of cases of Ebola has reached 2,319, a level that it said was ""alarming,"" and that the death toll is likely to rise. WHO said Wednesday it confirmed the details of the case to The Associated Press, which said the diplomat had been in contact with two patients who had died in Guinea, and that the outbreak has spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. Guinea, meanwhile, said this week it had reported the first case of Ebola in its outbreak zone, bringing the total number of confirmed, probable and suspected cases in the country to 258. The Guinea government said in a statement on Wednesday the diplomat had not been symptomatic and that he was being treated in an isolation ward at a state hospital. ""The situation is under control,"" the government statement said. Dr. Jose Fornos, director of the Ebola Institute of the World Health Organization's Guinea office, said in an interview that the world was preparing for the possibility of an increase in the number of cases. He said the first cases were recorded in Liberia on Aug. 19 and then in neighboring Sierra Leone two days later. He said the situation appeared ""under control and very contained"" in Liberia. AP journalists on the ground in West Africa contributed to this report"
27,"What the US can learn from Singapore's coronavirus strategy The US Army's response to its largest ever outbreak of meningitis in Singapore is being closely watched by the Pentagon. The US military said four soldiers may have contracted the new coronavirus, which is spread via saliva. The disease is caused by the same bacteria that causes flu. The US Army has conducted a ""high-level"" review of the strategy to reduce the risk of more infections. The military is reviewing the response of its 91st Airborne Division. On Tuesday, five members of staff at a US military hospital were infected. Two of them died and the fourth was hospitalised, becoming the first US military personnel in the case to die from the deadly infection. The Department of Defense said the two soldiers were in a location where their ""symptoms had not changed."" Both had been in Singapore preparing for deployment. The Washington Post says the US Army has been notified of a case of meningitis in Singapore and that the Army is working with federal and Singapore health authorities to investigate the latest case. The virus, which causes brain inflammation, is part of a growing list of infectious diseases that are spreading in Asia. Between 2000 and 2013, 11 people died in the outbreak. China accounted for the most deaths, at almost 800 and the rest were from other countries. The Pentagon will conduct a review of the current outbreak to assess the possibility that the disease could have come from neighbouring countries. It is expected to report in the next few weeks. The US military is working with health authorities to develop a plan for how to prevent the spread of the disease. ""If the US Army determines it is not possible to establish an effective strategy to contain the outbreak in the future, the military will work with the coronavirus community to develop and implement a plan to deal with this emerging threat,"" the Pentagon said. The US has already flown more than 17,000 troops to Singapore to help in the response, which is expected to cost more than $1bn a month. The outbreak has prompted concerns about what America's role in the region could mean. A senior defence official said the US may not be able to ensure that the infections do not spread further and that the US military can play a more active role in the region. US officials have also said they stand ready to respond to any emerging threat, including logistical support. The Department of Defense has described the virus as ""a highly"

It's like this will change his life. It's like he'll have Alzheimer's. It's not the first time Ted has shown himself to be a fierce critic of Trump. In 2007, Ted criticized Trump's healthcare plan, which was known as Obamacare, saying,"" It's horrible, it's cruel, and it's unfair to the American people. ""In a statement, he said,"" If this were a Republican president, it'd be much more devastating than the devastation that is currently being wrought on America. ""In the weeks following the election, Ted's son even said he wouldn't run for office, if Trump won. He told CNN,"" I don't trust Donald Trump. He doesn't know anything about national security, he doesn't know anything about people who are not citizens, he doesn't know anything about veterans, he doesn't care about veterans. He's just a blowhard on Twitter and he's got no idea what he's talking about. Ted is the product of a very unhappy childhood. I wasn't born to see a blowhard. I was just born to see someone that you're going to hate, and if the person that you hate comes to you, you're going to hate them as well.

She is travelling to Afghanistan to launch the World Food Programme's partnership with the UN to help the country's women. Her visit will be a show of solidarity with the women who have been affected by sexual violence. Women and girls are particularly vulnerable to sexual assault, including girls and women who have been raped and abused. Angelina Jolie told the UN there is a clear need to get more girls into primary education. This is the first time she's going to the UN Women meeting. ""I really hope that I can inspire the world as well to take action,"" she said. She was speaking at the UN Women's Food Summit and is due to meet with Mr Ban. She's also been attending the summit with her partner Brad Pitt. The couple are heading on holiday to the Maldives. The UN is hoping to get more women into primary school and primary education. So far more than 2.2 million girls are being taught how to cook, make food, and to use their own hands, according to the UN. To support the effort there is a fund to help with school uniforms, books and technology. Angelina Jolie is also a UN special envoy for Afghanistan. She has been at the world body's headquarters for the past three years. She called for all countries to do more to help the girls. She said there is still no end in sight to the conflict. I think Afghanistan is a very brutal country and we just cannot ignore it; I think we need more help, more help from the international community, more help, more attention from the world. What we need is support - a greater ability to help women and girls, not just"

33,"Rugby World Cup 2019 draw: Four key clashes The nations competing at the 2019 Rugby World Cup discovered who they will face in the group stages on Wednesday, with several intriguing fixtures being thrown up. England were dumped in the pool of death alongside France and Argentina, while Wales will face Australia and New Zealand are set to take on South Africa in the tournament in Japan. Here, <unk>'s NIK SIMON picks out one key clash from each group... Excitement levels will reach fever pitch any time Japan pull on their white and red jerseys. The hosts are targeting a top-eight finish and they will be eyeing up Scotland as potential prey. Following their famous victory over South Africa in 2015, anything could happen. If the Springboks can rediscover their old punch, any Test between these two powerhouses has the makings of a classic. The All Blacks can be slow starters at a World Cup so, with Italy as their band three opponent, this will be one of the headline match-ups. No doubt Steve Hansen will want a challenge so his team do not go through undercooked. This is the first time Le Crunch will feature in the pool stages of a World Cup. France are so often a tier one nation but they have slipped down the rankings to become a dangerous band two side. There were glimpses of their magic during the Six Nations and, with two years to prepare, they could be title challengers in 2019. The paths of these two nations crossed at the 2007, 2011 and the 2015 World Cups; with Australia winning all three Tests. Michael Cheika and Warren Gatland are now set for another showdown, with the loser potentially facing England in the quarter final, if Eddie Jones ""side live up to their billing and finish top of Pool C. Eddie Jones"" side are in Pool B with Scotland, Ireland and Wales while South Africa are in Group B. Follow the action here. <unk>'s NIK SIMON picks out one key clash from each group... Excitement levels will reach fever pitch any time Japan pull on their white and red jerseys. The hosts and Japan will be hoping to avoid a repeat of last year's famous Pool 1 heroics. If the Springboks can replicate the physicality of their historic rivals, they can match those monsters on their imaginations. If that means a slight mental edge in their play, they can emerge from nowhere."
34,"The movies that predicted an outbreak like coronavirus were mostly based on the idea that infections could spread in the United States. But many of the movies they predicted were based on the assumption that the first cases of an infection would occur in the United States, not in other countries. That assumption was widely debunked. The report also found that the WHO's global pandemic alert was based on the belief that the world was on the brink of a global pandemic, and that the virus was not yet contained. The new report, which addresses the possibility that the virus could still emerge in the coming years, relied on information from six global agencies that advise the U.N. Security Council on the threat of pandemics. They developed a risk analysis for the risk of pandemic in order to determine which countries should be most at risk. The United States and Canada were the most vulnerable countries to pandemic threats. China, India and Iceland, all of whom were in the highest risk groups, were the most vulnerable. The report warned that a pandemic was possible in the United States, and not in the world. A pandemic in the United States would take place almost every three years, with the United States and the rest of the world expected to experience a spate of outbreaks, the report said. The first wave of outbreaks would start in the summer of 1918, and the next wave would start in summer 1919 and continue until the end of this century. The first outbreak of AIDS in the United States during the Great Depression was attributed to the flu vaccine. The last flu pandemic, in 1968, came from the swine flu virus. The report suggested that the risk of a pandemic in the United States was still the same today as it was in the 1918 and 1919 pandemics. Dr. Douglas Shulman, director of the Center for Global Health Security at Columbia University, said that the report was ""very compelling"" and that it showed that the risk from a pandemic was much higher in the United States than in other countries. The report said that the risk of pandemics in the United States was so great in the past, that the only way to avoid a pandemic was to invest in public health programs and public education. Dr. Shulman said he was encouraged by the report's findings. ""We're seeing that the public health preparedness is now more robust again,"" he said."

57,"TV shows to watch if you're in the mood to lean into your worries about the economy. A quarter of households plan to spend more on the holidays than last year. Economist and author of the new book, ""The Return: How to Adjust for Economic Challenges,"" Dr. Seuss says the holidays are crucial for families - a time when their children watch TV and toys. ""I think it's important for families to think about the amount of time their kids spend in front of the TV every day,"" Dr. Seuss said. This is the time of year that is when people spend more money. The nation's economy is slowly recovering and it is expected to grow by at least 3 percent for the year. But worries about the economy are not uncommon. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, many families were watching TV and toys at the same time and spending more time with their children. This time, Dr. Seuss said, it's normal to feel uneasy about whether to spend more money on family happiness. ""We expect economic stability to continue, but it is important to be careful and aware of the impact of economic uncertainty,"" Dr. Seuss said. Children tend to focus their attention on the present day, and parents in general, he said. Dr. Seuss said he sees more families planning to spend more than they did during the recession. While they may be more relaxed about the economy, parents have been concerned about the financial health of the nation's most important industries. ""Economic anxiety could be leading consumers to view the recession as a negative,"" Dr. Seuss said. They should really be cautious. Dr. Seuss said he believes the consumer is starting to feel more ""cautious"" about the economy - and that might lead to price increases. ""The consumer's mood is probably just a little bit more cautious,"" Dr. Seuss said. He said parents are concerned about the economic health of their children, and this could increase the price of their items. He said he's worried about the economy's impact on parents. ""My problem is they are going to have a hard time getting insurance or buying their own child is going to be a tough time,"" he said. This is a time of the year when it's more important to be around in the family and understand the economic situation. It's not like they're worried about inflation or unemployment or the economy. In the past, American families did spend a lot but didn't spend much."

The plot involves a series of events that may seem like farce for some, but it's a fascinating and entertaining way to explore the dark and tragic underbelly of the Nazi regime. Pacino, who recently landed a role in ""A Most Violent Year,"" is a master storyteller, and his stories are often witty and sympathetic. The actor is a master storyteller, and his stories are often witty and sympathetic The film has a great deal of heart and soul in its telling, and the filmmakers didn't attempt to put this one away because it's a film that feels like a tragedy of sorts. They were simply trying to make it funny and unambiguous. This is the second installment of the ""Hunters"" series. The first was released in 2015, and the second, which also stars Anna Paquin, opens in 2017. The movies are only made with a relatively low budget, and they don't have the many stars that ""Hunters"" has. Some of the films on the series are about a group of Nazi officers -- many of them are just ordinary civilians -- who are told by a colleague that the Gestapo has a secret intelligence unit that's secretly tracking them. The films are also an exercise in comedy, but their characters are less realistic than Pacino's. The plot is set at a time of war, when Hitler's Germany was a brutal and fearsome power, and the Nazis still control many of the same countries that they wielded during the war. A Most Violent Year (82 minutes, at Landmark's E Street Cinema) is rated PG-13 for some violence and terror. It opens on Friday in New York. Written and directed by Roberto Orci; director of photography, Anthony Rapp; edited by Robert Cancel; music by Chad Brown; production designer, Michael"
62,"'Onward 'continues Pixar's apparent quest to make us cry Pixar's new animated film, ""Up,"" did not impress critics, though at times there was much applause. The film, for which director John Lasseter wrote and directed, stars Will Arnett and Tobey Maguire, and tells the story of a young boy named Oscar who falls in love with his evil aunt, who then drives him to extremes. As the film plays out on the big screen, Pixar did not shy away from its apparent quest to make us cry. In a statement, the studio said that ""Up"" has ""created a new generation of animators, artists, actors and producers and we couldn't be more pleased with how its creative team has adapted, rewritten and introduced the film to audiences in a spirit of dialogue."" At first, the film was praised for its storytelling and star power, and some critics were not impressed. ""We were shocked,"" film critic Alan Boyle wrote in a review for The Times. There's often the feeling that the film is a bland, unfeeling, formulaic attempt to make the world a smaller place, less concerned about the emotional and intellectual problems we're all facing. The animation industry is a constant battleground for people's cynicism and hatred of the industry. But ""Up"" offers an ironic example of why that shouldn't be. The movie is a lot like ""Up,"" as in, ""Okay, so we've got the same problem, but not the same problem."" ""But it's a real, serious problem,"" said Amy Pascal, president of the Writers Guild of America. What we're really talking about here is how your colleagues are working together to solve the problems of a society that is obsessed with being obsessed with having all the resources for all the things you want to do. In the new version of ""Up,"" Pixar plans to use ""the best of the best"" animation techniques to make the film a more realistic and less complicated movie. ""We have been working on this film for over a year,"" Pixar said in a statement. I'm still overwhelmed by the enthusiasm and enthusiasm for this film. I'm hopeful that we will have something very exciting to be told in a movie that people have a great appreciation for. The movie will be released in the United States on Feb."

64,"The Fastest Way To Pay Off $10,000 In Credit Card Debt: Credit Card Debt Is a Big Problem For Your Credit Card Photo Credit: David Becker / Bloomberg There's a new study out today that shows that getting a paid-for balance card can be a big problem for your credit card balance. The study, produced by the consumer advocacy group Consumers Union, found that the average balance on a credit card for a person with a $10,000 credit card debt is $623, almost entirely due to interest charges. That's well above the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's threshold of $33,500. The study comes in response to a June report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that showed that people are being forced to pay more in interest and fees than they otherwise would. The study found that 10 out of every 10 credit card holders said they'd pay off their debts if they had a card with a $1,000 balance. That is more than the average credit card debt, which is at $56,500. The study also found that average balance on a credit card is $17,500, including the maximum interest rate. However, the average balance on a card with a $1,000 balance is still only about 1.5 per cent higher than the average credit card debt of $15,240. ""It's frustrating to see consumers being forced to pay more in interest and fees than they otherwise would,"" said Consumers Union President Pamela Geller. Credit card companies and consumers need to be more diligent about their credit card debt. Credit card debt should be treated with the same importance as any other form of investment or loan. We applaud the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for its decision to proactively investigate the issue and look into ways to make credit cards more affordable. According to the CFPB's latest study, more than 90 per cent of credit card holders say they'd pay off their interest and fees in full if they paid for their credit cards in full along with an annual return of 10 per cent a year. The study also found that 63 per cent of people would pay off their credit card debt in full if they paid off $1,000 in debt. ""Credit cards are a good idea for consumers to manage their debt,"" Geller said. This article originally appeared on Bankrate.

71,"Fly in a WWI fighter plane in the sky for the first time in 50 years It was made using the same technology used to create the first ever British fighter jet. The first flight took place in 1942, and since then the two planes have been operated by the same company - the British Aircraft Corporation. The plane had to be taken out of service for repairs, so it could fly again on a permanent basis. The pilot made a last-minute take-off to the UK from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. It landed in the field of the Hampshire conservation area. It's thought the plane - called the ""Daft Punk"" - will have special attention from tourists and locals alike. The two planes will fly together for the first time in the morning sky as part of a UK-wide initiative called ""The Fly in a WWI Story.""

The aircraft, which is said to be the first plane to fly in WWII, was found by a man who was walking his dog on Tuesday. He said he saw the aircraft on a ledge, and called the police. The original project, run by the Heritage Lottery Fund, was in its early stages when it was unveiled in 1943, and has since been used by the RAF, the Royal Navy and other organisations to improve search and rescue. The Daft Punk plane, which was built in conjunction with the United States Air Force, is known as ""The Fly in a WWI Story"" and is known as the ""Fly in a WWII Flight"" and ""The Fly in a WWII Flight."" The UK government set up the project, which it hoped would foster and encourage interest in the country's 1940-41 history. It hopes to raise £30,000 to fund the project. The aircraft is expected to take off from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire and land at Dawlish Airfield in Wiltshire.

74,"One of India's biggest banks has been rescued by the government after its assets tumbled by a quarter in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. BCCI, the country's largest brokerage by market value, announced the rescue of its parent company, India's largest lender by market value, after making huge writedowns on the value of bad loans, which have grown sharply in the current financial crisis. The move was meant to help to plug a $2.5bn (£1.6bn) capital shortfall in BCCI's business, which has suffered steep losses on credit card loans and other debt made to people with poor credit histories. BCCI said it had recorded $176m of writedowns related to bad loans, but said it was still likely to hit the group's profits this year. The writedowns and other losses have been partly offset by a $5.9bn revaluation of its own debt, which BCCI said should reduce its net interest margin by another $114m this year. Mr Vijayan said that BCCI's main problem was that it had been in a difficult position in the past due to its large exposure to bad loans. However he added that the BCCI's losses were ""contained"" and not ""detrimental."" ""The main issue is the global recession, and the bad loans are still piling up,"" he said. We need to take care of that. But we will take action. BCCI said it would hold a further review of its business in the second half of the year. The bank said it had $8.4bn of net cash at the end of September and a further $2.2bn of net debt at the end of March. The writedowns stemmed from loans to people classed as low-risk due to poor credit quality. The government has set quotas for new loans at which banks must lower their bad loan ratio by 10 per cent this year, or face suspension. BCCI's shares fell by nearly 15 per cent in early trading in Mumbai on Monday. The stock exchange was closed because of a strike. The government faces an election this year in which the BCCI's popularity will be in the political spotlight. The BCCI has an estimated 600 million customers but has been seen as overly reliant on its financial services arm. A poll by the Times of India put the BCCI at 54 per cent."
75,"India's top court strikes down ban on cryptocurrency trading - RT Business News India's Supreme Court has struck down a central proposal to ban cryptocurrency trading in the country, which had been proposed by the finance minister, Dharmendra Pradhan. The decision comes after the country's central bank cut interest rates in a bid to stem the decline of the rupee after the rupee dropped below a record low against the US dollar. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are seen as ""speculative"" investments in the country and the recent declines in the rupee have come out of this vein, according to Pradhan. The declines were triggered by the US dollar's decline against the euro, which has fallen by about 15 percent against the greenback this year. The decision by the court on Monday leaves the ban unchanged. India has been trying to fight the perceived threat of cryptocurrency innovation in the country by raising interest rates. In a letter to the finance minister, Pradhan told Reuters the lower interest rate ""is the right thing to do and is a positive step forward in efforts to fight cryptocurrency and other speculative investments in the country."" The ruling is likely to have wider ramifications beyond the rupee. On Tuesday, India's central bank lowered its key interest rate by a quarter point to 6.25 percent. The rupee has been in steady decline against the US dollar since the end of May, plunging 3.7 percent against the dollar. Bitcoin fell to $20,000 on Friday, according to CoinDesk. As a result, the country's finance minister, Arun Jaitley, announced a tax rise and spending cuts. Jaitley has said the government would do everything it can to combat the cryptocurrency and crack down on illegal trading in the country. India's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced a tax hike and spending cuts on Monday. The tax hike is the first by a government in the country in five years. Jaitley said he believes the government will push hard to curb the rise of the virtual currency, which is often used as an alternative currency to buying bitcoin and other foreign currencies. Jaitley said that the government will continue to implement reforms in the financial sector, including the purchase of digital currencies and a government-led digital economy.

78,"India has an increasingly global perspective on beauty -- but the patriarchy still looms large. For the past 20 years, the Indian woman has lived in the United States, but she now lives in the United States -- where she's becoming the first Indian-American woman to be named a finalist for the Miss Universe pageant in 2005. She has had her fair share of controversies, including a series of legal matters that have delayed her entry into the United States. But this is the first time in her career that she's been nominated for the Miss America pageant. ""I feel like I won the Miss Universe crown,"" said the 32-year-old. But I feel like I lost the contest because of certain things. I was very nervous going into this. I did get a lot of questions from people, but it wasn't as fun as I imagined, especially with the controversy. But I can finally say that I've been given the opportunity to be a winner. The Miss Universe competition is held every year in Las Vegas, and the first year the winner is crowned -- which means that the final will be performed in New York. ""I've been to New York!"" said Modi. I've already had a lot of great conversations with the pageant's producers. This is a tremendous honor for me. I'm really excited, and I'm very proud. ""The Miss Universe pageant has been around in many different countries,"" she added. It's a very different environment. It's not a beauty pageant. It's a human pageant. It's a competition that's going to be won by a woman, and that's the beauty of it. ""It's difficult to prepare,"" said Modi. Every day you're preparing yourself. It's tough. But I know it's OK to prepare when you get off the stage. I always have, and I'm happy to do it now. Modi's father is Indian-American, and her mother is a Pakistani-American. She's also from New York and raised in the Bronx and Manhattan. Though she's a born-again Christian, Modi said, ""I'm very spiritual and I've had a lot of good experiences.""

79,"Fact check: Donald Trump made 115 false claims in the last two weeks of February, far above the total number of false claims filed by the previous president, Barack Obama. However, Trump's numbers do not take into account the amount of time that Trump used to make his false claims, and the fact that he claimed twice as many false claims in the first two weeks of February, according to AP. Trump's claims were the most false, at 201 in the first two weeks of February, and the worst, at 225. The number of false claims is about the same as Obama's total. The president has been counting on the claim of the incoming speaker of the House to be just as accurate as his predecessor, Republican John Boehner. Related: Trump's numbers on the trail: 11 things he did wrong Fact Check: Trump's number on the day In fact, the president's claim was the sixth-highest in several weeks. It was the second highest in two weeks and the highest number ever recorded. The House speaker was in office for just over four weeks, and the claim of a false election was lower than that of Obama's. Trump was in the process of adding more false claims, according to AP, and the number of false claims has since declined. It's a bit like the Obama administration was making up Obama's claim of a false election in the final weeks before his inauguration. The number of false claims filed by the previous president - which was the most frequently reported figure in a single week - was no different than the previous administration. The two presidents had separate claims that year. Obama's claim was the third highest in a single week and the biggest weekly gain in a single month. The final four states reporting on the president's claims on the day of his inauguration also showed an increase in claims. Ohio had six false claims, Michigan eight, and Washington, D.C., six. Obama, Boehner, Obama, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell all claimed more than 81,000 claims, while Trump claimed 95,176. The Trump administration's claims were almost exclusively false. Trump's claims totaled almost 50,000 claims, the most in the history of the White House, according to AP. The most recent count of claims was released earlier this month.

The virus has infected some 95,000 people with almost 3,000 deaths, the DAPA said in a statement, adding that more than one million health workers have been sent to fight the virus. ""Globally, the H1N1 virus is still emerging from the 1918-1919 pandemic, but has since spread globally,"" the statement added. According to recent data, the virus has now spread over the world, with at least 49 countries reporting cases of the disease in 2017. More than 800 cases of infections are reported in the UK every day, according to health officials, with the WHO estimating that a further 600 to 800 cases could be anticipated over the next six months. The disease is caused by the A (H1N1) virus and is known to present a high risk of complications such as pneumonia. There have also been cases in several West African countries, including Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone. The UK and US have said they are committed to dealing with the virus, but the WHO has warned any further spread could pose a threat to food supplies and international travel. The health department of Nigeria has also warned the country is in the midst of a ""serious food crisis"" as farmers struggle to cope with the outbreak. READ MORE: ""Don't panic,"" FDA warns as H1N1 outbreak spreads to US, Canada & Mexico The World Health Organization, which announced in late September that the epidemic had officially been declared over, said it was closely monitoring the situation. Health facilities in Mexico are running out of supplies of the ""Tamiflu"" drug, which the US Food and Drug Administration says is a ""very important"" strain of the virus. The CDC has now issued an alert for pregnant women to keep away from work, schools and nurseries. Mexico reported 9,000 cases of the virus in 2017, including 366 deaths, while the US reported 2,143 cases. The WHO has warned that it could take another year before the virus is completely eradicated from Mexico."
81,"Trump stumbles in first efforts to control virus response as fear spreads and markets fall in wake of Paris attacks and spreads across the globe as fears grow over global health and wider security weakens. The first statement by President Donald Trump, in which he said the United States was in a ""period of emergency,"" also set out his readiness to ""respond"" to the Paris attacks, which claimed the lives of more than 130 people. For the first time he also said the US would stand with France in ""the face of the terrorists,"" and on Friday, he announced that the US was also considering banning all Muslims from entering the country, and was considering taking action against Russian meddling in the US election. The White House had earlier played down the significance of Trump's remarks, saying Mr Trump's response, when he did not specifically identify the perpetrators of the attacks, was more about security than specifically addressing the threat posed by jihadist groups. ""As President Trump said recently, he will act immediately to protect our citizens - law enforcement agencies, and our civilian law enforcement agencies - against any attackers who seek to harm us and to do us harm,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. A White House official said Mr Trump was ""not talking about the United States"" when he spoke of Paris. It was more about a ""broader fight against terrorism."" Speaking in the Rose Garden, Mr Trump was asked about the Paris attacks in a direct reference to the attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. That attack was carried out by a man who had an envelope with explosives in it and who was killed by police after a shootout with officers. That attack was carried out by a man who had a permit to carry out a shooting on French soil, and who had a permit to carry out bombing on French soil. That attack was carried out by a man who had a permit to use a shooting at a French military base, ""Mr Trump said."" I think it was very sad, ""Mr Trump added. And I think it was a very, very bad, very unfortunate situation. As the president spoke, the US stock market plunged as fears spread over international security and the US economy, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 1000 points in early trading in Europe, after news of the Paris attacks. Markets in Europe and the US also fell. In the US, the Dow Jones closed down 2.2 per cent."

Vice President Mike Pence had earlier been named as the acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Speaking at an event in Indiana, Mr Trump said he had been informed of Pence's plans to hold a meeting with the acting director of the CDC, Richard Besser. I have decided to get the Vice President to be involved in this. Mike has been an outstanding director. He is one of a kind. I have every confidence in him. He is the best, ""Mr Trump said. We have a lot of options. The VP is working on it. The Vice President will take over the director's role. Pence will still work at the CDC and will not be a full-time assistant director, the US leader said. Mr Trump also said he was told Mr Pence was"" the right person to lead this effort. ""Earlier the president had tweeted that he had spoken to the CDC director about the potential impacts of the outbreak on the US economy. The White House said the president was"" reviewing the situation and working with (CDC Director) Tom Frieden. ""Mr Pence is a seasoned public servant, having served as deputy governor of Indiana in the 1990s. He has previously served as mayor of Chicago and as governor of Indiana. He previously served as a congressman and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Before the US outbreak of the deadly virus was declared over last month, the virus was seen for the first time in years in the US. The US had already reported 54 cases. The virus has caused an outbreak of some illnesses in recent years in Mexico, Brazil and Central America, and scientists are examining how the virus spreads. The virus has affected about 600 people in 33 countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said most affected countries have been able to control the spread of the virus. Its latest update says the threat of spread in the region between April and December has dropped from the highest level seen in the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa since it was first identified in 1976 to its lowest level in the past five years.

Ten years ago we had four attacks every day in Delhi. We thought they were bad. But just yesterday, by the way, a village was attacked in north Delhi. Now the government has ordered a review. Video Journalist: Pardeep Guleria India's deadly sectarian violence has left at least four people dead in the past week. Last week, two girls, aged 15 and 15, were killed when a crowd gathered in a village in Uttar Pradesh state. In a similar attack, two men killed a taxi driver in the state on Friday. And last Saturday a teenager was slain in the same area in a similar attack. In the three previous sectarian attacks in Delhi, Muslims killed more than 600 people - of whom 335 died. Are we afraid? Yes, and we are afraid to be afraid. We fear that there could be more attacks as we travel around the country, ""said one man in a bus shelter in Manesar, outside Delhi in the Hindu Kush district of the Indian capital. We don't want to be afraid. We are afraid of being on the roads and walking alone,"" he said. Image copyright Reuters Image caption The attacks took place at a bus shelter in Manesar In the previous attack, an 18-year-old was killed in a bus shelter in the Kaligal area of Delhi, and the following day, a woman was killed and four people were killed in a stampede as people tried to flee from a nearby mosque. The sectarian violence, first of its kind in India, began in the northern state of Bihar in July 2014, when residents in the town of Kandhamal killed a Shia man who had been accused of involvement in a fatal attack on a Hindu temple in the same district. The government has blamed the attacks on ""terrorists,"" who it said are mostly from the Muslim majority in India. Last month three Sunni Muslims were killed in a similar attack in a village in the north-eastern state of Assam. The motive for that attack has not been made clear, but an internet posting identified the attackers as a militant group called the ""Baramullah"" or ""Lord of Baramullah.""

84,"Big Tech's honeymoon with the world's second-largest internet market is ending. The $12 billion company has been trying to put a stop to Facebook and other social media sites that control more than 80 percent of the Internet's traffic. It hopes to make money from selling ads outside its own Web site, a business that Facebook still dominates. But the company also believes that Facebook is beginning to challenge its dominance. The company's shares fell 2 percent in after-hours trading to $17.83. Microsoft and Intel announced that they would launch a platform this week that would allow people to search and share videos. The new service will be called ""News Watch,"" or ""Video Watch."" Microsoft said it expects the site to spread quickly through its own website. Meanwhile, Facebook is in the midst of its search for a new leader. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has turned over the reins to his chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. ""We're just looking at a new model,"" said Tom Porcelli, a Facebook spokesman. In the absence of a clear leader, we're going to continue to find new ways to innovate for the benefit of everyone. But Porcelli concedes that the company needs to start looking for a new chief executive. That could be even tougher than searching for someone else. Google and Yahoo, for instance, have been searching for a chief executive for years. ""You're looking for someone who's going to keep on doing what's important to your business,"" Porcelli said. You have to keep innovating. But Facebook's business is different from Google's. It sells ads on the Web and shares its profits with advertisers. The company does not break out earnings from its advertising business. But because Facebook's users like to see their profiles in profiles that have already been seen by advertisers, the company can earn significant revenue from it. Mr. Porcelli said Facebook was planning to make money off of the market opportunity. ""We believe it's a huge opportunity for Facebook to really differentiate itself,"" he said. We're excited about that opportunity. But we also think that it's going to take time. It could take time to get it right. Mr. Porcelli said that the company expected to begin selling ads on Facebook next year. That is the company's first ad program, which could take longer than expected. Facebook is the latest company to start its own Facebook ads. Google has already rolled out ads on its site."
85,"24 dead, at least 188 injured in New Delhi clashes amid Trump's visit - RT News At least 24 people have died in clashes between police and protestors in New Delhi, with New Delhi blaming the violence on opponents of US President Donald Trump. Protesters have clashed with police in New Delhi after Trump's visit. The protesters are angry at a plan by the Indian government to open nine military bases in the city in the first phase of a new US-India military alliance. The plan has been fiercely criticized by human rights groups, who say the Indian government has acted to diminish rights and freedoms, and that it has not lived up to international standards. The police action came just hours after at least one person died and dozens more were injured. At least 10 people were also injured in the clashes. The protests began on Tuesday, and the demonstrators are angry that the government has not informed them of the decision to open eight military bases, including the new Delhi International Airport, on the same day as Trump's visit. The demonstrators clashed with the police and arrested about 1,000 protesters, who were later arrested, Reuters reported. Many of the protesters attacked police, forcing them to withdraw. Some of the demonstrators used petrol bombs and set fire to vehicles and stores. The protesters also threw stones at the police and set fire to their vehicles, according to police. The Indian government has denied any involvement in the protests. On Thursday, Trump was scheduled to hold talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The two men have been holding talks since May. Both men have called for an end to the violence and offered to implement anti-terrorism and anti-corruption measures, according to a statement from Modi's office. Trump had also left India on Thursday morning, for his first foreign trip since taking office. He has spent much of his time in New Delhi, visiting India's capital and holding meetings with Indian leaders. He will then head to Washington, D.C., where he will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. On Monday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that Trump is in India for summit discussions aimed at deepening relations with the US. ""I'm here to meet with Prime Minister Modi,"" Modi said. He is here to discuss the implementation of the agreement between India and the US on the defence agreement. It is a great opportunity to forge a new partnership."

The religious event can be traced back to the time of the Mushtaq Lama, who died about 550 years ago. It has an important historical significance. It is typically celebrated on a Friday in July, a Hindu festival dedicated to the festival. The Hindu calendar relates to the timing of the harvest and the beginning of spring. It is not considered sacred by the government, which considers it a harvest day. It is also celebrated on the Hindu religious calendar. An estimated 200 million Hindus visit India every year for Holi, with the country celebrating the spring harvest on March 14 and March 15. In November, the UN estimated that in 2016, Indians spent more than £8bn on gifts, food, entertainment and gifts to themselves. Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that children from low-income homes would receive free education for nine years, along with special health checks and extra money to set up special places in hospitals. The Hindu calendar is often used as a platform for political and religious rhetoric, to promote religious harmony. The Hindu religious festival is celebrated in more than 70 countries around the world. This year's celebrations started on Monday with a procession to the site of Satyabrata, a mythical Hindu god, on which people traditionally cross. Watch more on India Business Report.

88,"Indian MP: Our nation's glorious tradition of religious tolerance is being shredded - RT Viral India's former Muslim chairman has launched a scathing attack on Indian Muslims, who he claims have been subjected to ""years of discrimination and persecution"" by their ""brutal and intolerant"" culture. Ramma Rajan, a member of the Muslim Uttar Pradesh Diaspora, told the Indian Express newspaper that Indian Muslims no longer had the luxury of ""having another year of humiliation and humiliation,"" which he said was affecting their belief in India's unique culture and values. Rajan, who was mayor of the Jaipur district, was among a group of politicians visiting India in January to discuss the national vote in the state. He told the Times of India newspaper he was looking forward to seeing some of the Hindu stars of Indian cinema and being able to attend film screenings. He said he had been ""encouraged"" by the Indian government's efforts to encourage the integration of Muslims in the country. People have been discriminated against for centuries and then they are slapped with violence, humiliation and persecution. It is just a matter of time, ""he said. Rajan has been forced to reconsider his position on the issue of Hindus' Muslim rights in India after the country's Supreme Court upheld a law banning political parties representing minorities and its political parties. In January, the court ruled that the law violated the country's constitution, which dates back to the British colonial era. The law has been widely condemned by rights organizations, particularly India's Hindu minority, as an attempt to stifle dissent. However, the Indian High Commissioner to the UK is upbeat, saying the legislation is actually working."" The Hindu government has already shown that it is prepared to introduce a law that permits the participation of non-Hindu groups in political activities in the country, ""the High Commissioner, Mike Gapes, told the Times of India. We expect that a new bill will be presented soon. One of the main challenges to the new law is that many of India's Hindus believe that Islam is the true religion of God, and have taken to running anti-Muslim events for the past two years, using the slogan"" Don't be a Muslim. ""And so it appears that the Hindu community remains determined to create a law that will prevent the spread of extremism."
89,"Why India's citizenship law crosses the line From the late 1980s to the early 2000s, Indian citizenship was granted to nearly 300,000 people, according to government statistics. That's enough to account for an 11th of the population, but not to account for the entire U.S. population. How does that work? In theory, if you apply for citizenship, your parents are Indian. If you apply for citizenship, your parents are citizens of the U.S. If you apply for citizenship, your parents are U.S. citizens. If you apply for citizenship, your parents are citizens of the United States. The U.S. Department of Justice recently filed a lawsuit against the Indian government to block the new law and the government's efforts to block the new law from going into effect. The Justice Department is expected to file a lawsuit soon, according to a Department of Justice official who requested anonymity. The new law is expected to go into effect in 2018. That would give the U.S. an estimated 1.7 million Indian immigrants. The law is in effect for three years, and the government has said it will seek a review before any permanent changes are made. The new law would also give the government an estimated 600,000 more Indian citizens, and make the country one of the most polluted countries in the world. Related: India's new law is a test of U.S. resolve The new law would allow the government to continue granting citizenship to U.S. citizens regardless of the country's nationality, but it would also prohibit the government from granting citizenship to U.S. citizens over the age of 18, according to the White House. In the case of Indian citizenship, the government has argued, even though the applicant doesn't have American citizenship, the citizenship must be valid when he joined the military. The White House has argued in court papers that the decision constitutes persecution. ""This law is intended to provide people of the United States citizenship that exceeds the statutory requirements in the Constitution,"" the Justice Department has said, according to the official. The new law would require more than 20 years of age to become an American citizen, but the new law would have to meet other requirements. But the White House says no changes have been made to the law since President Trump took office. CNNMoney (New Delhi) First published March 24, 2018: 12: 20 PM ET PM ET. The story has been updated to reflect the official filing of a lawsuit. The story was originally published March 24, 2018."

The move comes after the US banned internet providers from running adverts on India's most popular social networking services, including WhatsApp and Line. The government has demanded the internet companies halt adverts on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter as part of an effort to tackle the spread of lethal encryption in its most heavily-regulated economy. Photograph: Marcos Cabral / AP / REX / Shutterstock India follows US and parts of Europe in seeking to prevent internet providers from intercepting messages sent by terrorists and other spies, and from spreading them through encrypted networks. But it has faced criticism from human rights activists who say its efforts are fuelling the spread of Islamic extremism. Mahesh Rangarajan, a professor at Mumbai's Jawaharlal Nehru University, said on Twitter: ""The government should cease blocking users in India for a mere 10 minutes, they should also be banned from hosting or hosting this information.""

On Wednesday, Google, Facebook and Twitter were also blocked in India by the authorities. In March, the country's cabinet ordered that WhatsApp and Line be blocked. In April, officials in the capital Delhi reported that an offensive on the city's streets had killed more than 70 people. The latest announcement by the government comes after a month-long stand-off in which police arrested and briefly detained dozens of people over alleged links to the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba. The group is blamed for the 2008 Mumbai attacks and which the government blames for the deadliest attack in the history of Indian politics. India is under pressure from the US, Britain, Canada and parts of Europe to crack down on encryption. Lashkar-e-Taiba, also known as Jaish-e-Mohammed, is seeking to create a separate state and has been designated a terrorist group by Islamabad"

Some of them are being trained as suicide bombers. Most of them are not even in school. I feel for the children who are there, because there are so many people who have lost everything. It is so difficult to see the other side of the conflict. There are so many little kids dying, and the parents are crying. It is so close to their home. After that we will see more and more. But the children will not be back. This is not the war the people want to fight. This war is destroying them. They are like the victims of the war they are fighting. They will only be supported if we are strong, the government, the religious and political leaders. People are afraid to speak out and they are afraid to eat, so we have to protect them. We can't wait for them to come home. The real war is not about the children. It is about the war. It is not the time to talk of the war, or show off. But if we want to protect the children, we need to help them. And if we want to help the people, we need to help the children who are suffering. People are afraid to speak out and they are afraid to eat, so we have to help the people. But our priority is to support the children and not to shoot at children.

The agency reported that a court issued a detention order on Friday evening for Prince Mohammed, Sheikh Nayef bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, and several others with suspected links to the prince. The seven others were named as Abdullah bin Saud, Amr al-Haj Abdullah, Abdullah bin Sultan bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, and Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz al Saud. The three men were detained in the capital Riyadh. The crown prince has been pushing for reform and reconciliation in Saudi Arabia, one of the world's top oil producers. He says he is committed to a ""moderate Islam"" and for the kingdom's Sunni minority to be free of discrimination. Critics say his harsh interpretation of Islam limits the role of religious authorities in the society and leaves them susceptible to abuse. The crown prince, who serves as defence minister and is second in line to the throne, has also been critical of his fellow royals, saying they have ""paid a high price"" for their role in the country's troubles. Saudi Arabia has been rocked by months of protests calling for the reinstatement of deposed Interior Minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who was removed after his security forces used force to disperse hundreds of thousands of protesters. The opposition has called for an entirely new constitutional monarchy. The next step in the reform programme includes a new system of council, which would be the most powerful in the kingdom. Following the announcement of that plan, opposition activists in the kingdom have called for a protest march planned for the following day on the streets of the capital Riyadh. The plan was reportedly approved by King Salman, who has been in power for two years. It comes after two young princes were disqualified from running for the first time in the kingdom. Mohammed bin Nayef, who was in power for 23 years, was among 22 princes and businessmen who have been disqualified. The disqualification prompted an outcry by human rights campaigners, who said the decision to bar Prince Mohammed and others of his generation from running for office was undemocratic."
93,"Turkey and Russia announce ceasefire in northwest Syria 21 (UPI) -- The Turkish and Russian governments announced a ceasefire in the town of Tel Abyad in northwest Syria, the third confirmed ceasefire in less than a week. The two partners announced Saturday that they were beginning a new ceasefire ""in the coming days"" that was ""to take effect immediately,"" and would last for 24 hours. The deal calls for all militants and civilians to leave, and for the remaining captives and their family members to be freed. The two countries will also begin the process of evacuating about 2,000 people from the area, which is near the Iranian border. The United Nations said it would work on securing the evacuation of the people, as well as those who are currently in Syria. Syrian state news agency SANA said that the ceasefire began Saturday morning. The announcement comes after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan suggested in an interview published Saturday that a Turkish offensive against Kurdish fighters in Syria would be a ""big mistake."" ""We have to prevent this from happening,"" Erdoğan said. We will not allow it to happen. Turkey has been battling the Kurdish YPG militia and the United States, the allies of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, in Syria. Ankara has repeatedly threatened to launch a military campaign against the group. The ceasefire comes as Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan continues to push for a ""greater Turkey-Syrian"" relationship, something which the United States has not been willing to agree to. Erdogan has argued that the U.S. is taking sides in the Syrian conflict. ""We are still the ones who are against U.S. intervention... we have to defend Turkey and defend our lands, our borders and our national interests,"" he said Friday. Many of our allies and partners have killed ISIS, supported [Iraqi militant group] ISIS and have threatened to attack our borders. The U.S. strategy is to eliminate it. U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday the U.S. would ""love"" to see the two countries find a settlement in Syria, but expressed doubt as to whether Turkey would seek NATO membership. This is an idea that Turkey wants to see, and Turkey wants to see, but we cannot go into it. We have to wait and see what happens, ""he said. We can't go in and say we would love to have Turkey there. We have to look at the other side of the argument and see what happens."
94,"21 of the world's 30 cities with the worst air pollution are in India. In the city of Ahmedabad, residents from around the world were forced to breathe in dangerous levels of harmful air, with the country ranking sixth out of 23 cities in the World Health Organisation's Air Quality Index. The state government, which is responsible for managing the pollution, has called on India's polluting industries to cut emissions. The government announced the beginning of a campaign to ""clean up"" Delhi's air. Air quality is really not good at the moment. It's not going to improve until we cut emissions, ""Dilip Vyas, deputy chief minister of Tamil Nadu, told reporters on Friday. Even though we get the pollution, we still get the health issue. What is the point of cleaning the air? We have to breathe in it. The fact is, Delhi is a very polluted city, the air is not good. Vyas said he had consulted the medical experts in Ahmedabad and was confident the city would avoid an increase in asthma cases in the coming years."" I have worked for the last 20 years to improve Delhi's air quality, ""he told reporters. The mayor has already said he's going to clean up the city. The situation has stabilised. The WHO said its figures showed a"" significant improvement ""in air quality in India's largest city in the last 10 years and that Indian cities were now on average cleaner than the WHO's standard. In India, the government aims to cut emissions by at least 40% by 2030 from 2005 levels. While India is not a signatory to the Paris climate accord, the country is one of the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. The World Health Organization says it will propose new targets for cutting emissions by 2020 but does not set a specific target for a national target. Vyas said last week that the government would look at the recommendations submitted by public health experts and the scientific community. The government has also made progress in cleaning up Delhi's notorious air. During the past decade, the city's population has grown by more than 2,000 people and the city's air quality has improved, according to the state government. The city has also provided free public transport for city employees and taken steps to reduce vehicle emissions. The government has also offered free access to the subway and public bus. The city last year suspended services for a day to deal with air pollution."
95,"A coronavirus outbreak could be devastating for poorer countries, WHO says NEW YORK -- A combination of outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and camels has been blamed for the deaths of hundreds of people in Saudi Arabia since last month. ""This is the first time that we see this many people,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, told ""CBS This Morning"" Thursday. More than 300 people have been infected with MERS since the Middle East outbreak was first reported last month. It was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The virus is spread through direct contact with camels. Cases in the United States have been rare. Most of the deaths have been in Saudi Arabia, but the outbreak has spread to other parts of the Middle East. Cases in the United States have been rare. Experts say the risk of MERS to humans is very low. But the virus is spreading rapidly. ""There is no cure for MERS,"" said Dr. Richard Besser, ABC News chief health and medical correspondent. It is one of the most baffling and horrible diseases ever seen. The MERS virus can cause pneumonia, fever and kidney failure, but can also lead to severe breathing problems when coughing or sneezing. According to the CDC, one of the most common symptoms of Middle East respiratory syndrome is coughing, sneezing and a runny nose. The virus is spread by animals. In winter, it can be fatal. And in people with poor immunity, people who have unvaccinated family members or who do not get flu shots are at highest risk. Despite the risks, experts say the virus can be prevented by improving vaccination. ""It's important that we protect ourselves against the spread of MERS among people who have been in close contact with humans,"" said Dr. Fauci. He says it is possible that the virus could be passed on to one person. ""I think it's possible that this virus could be passed on this way to someone else,"" he said. The World Health Organization recommends that people get vaccinated before traveling to a Middle Eastern country. The CDC is working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine how well the virus is spreading. ""This virus can be passed on through saliva and through bodily fluids"
96,"Snake venom can now be made in a lab and that could save many lives. The new venom contains a combination of three anti-venom combinations that work within a synthesis of the venom's anti-inflammatory and anti-venom. Dr. Jonathan Allen, who described the new clinical trial, said that if this new FDA approval is anything to go by, it could be a very big step forward. Not everyone is convinced that a new and safe form of venom is in the works. ""It's not that surprising,"" said Dr. Peter Oyama, head of the Department of Oncology and Emergency Medicine at the University of Toronto. It's just the sheer magnitude of the evidence and the potential (of the venom). Dr. Dennis Grisham, chief of the division of emergency medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, told Reuters: ""There's certainly strong evidence of a need for new drugs to protect people against cancer."" ""I think there's a risk of false positives,"" said Oyama, who was not involved in the new research. But there is very real potential for a very safe drug.

97,"Australian official who met with Ivanka Trump and Barr last week tests positive for coronavirus An Australian official who met with Ivanka Trump and Barr last week tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the Australian government. An official with the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources said he was one of the three people who attended the President Donald Trump's business meeting in Washington on Friday. Neither the official nor a representative for the Australian government were named due to the sensitivity of the situation. The official told Fairfax Media that the two businessmen were ""relaxed,"" and that it was unknown if they were sick before or after the meeting. The department said the meeting was not an official business meeting, and was attended by both political and business leaders, and the government had no idea who was in attendance. The official said the man who did attend was one of three people who attended. ""It was clearly something of a surprise, because you would expect it from a government-to-government meeting,"" the official told Fairfax Media. It's kind of naive not to know who would be in attendance. The man was among 10 people who were invited to the meeting, an official said, but it was never an official business meeting. The official said he could not confirm whether they were employees at the meeting or were in the office. The department confirmed in a statement that it was ""aware of an outbreak of the so-called Barr virus,"" and was working with FDA and CDC since it was identified in the United States. The Australian government has not confirmed the source of the virus. The first family is known to have had close contact with officials. It has also been linked to a spike in cases of the virus in Sydney, Scotland and Germany. The Australian government has been asked to provide details of the Barr virus outbreak after it was identified in New York City on Monday. The Department of Health and Human Services said that it was reviewing all cases of the virus and that there was no evidence of any human-to-human transmission. ""An outbreak of a virus like Barr virus would be likely to present a serious risk to health in the community,"" the department said. The US government has previously been asked to provide information about the outbreak of the bug. The coronavirus is one of the most common and serious illnesses in the world. It can be treated by washing hands, keeping coughs and sneezes clean and eating food contaminated by virus."

The Australian government said it will make a decision on whether to ban travel to Brazil for the Olympics. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has called for a worldwide ban on travel to Rio de Janeiro amid concerns that the city's beaches could become stagnant. In Australia, there are concerns the disease could be transmitted through contact with an infected person. But this doesn't mean the virus will disappear from the tropics as some climate models have suggested.

99,"Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson diagnosed with coronavirus Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have been diagnosed with the deadly coronavirus, it has been revealed. The two stars have been suffering from the illness, which causes inflammation of the membranes of the eye, causing them to lose vision early in their performances. Hanks, 61, and Wilson, 56, have both been battling the flu, with the star revealing it had hit the couple after they shared a hotel room together. Intriguingly, the pair were on a long-haul flight from Los Angeles to New York, which the couple visited after their tour. According to British newspaper The Sun, Mr Hanks was diagnosed with the coronavirus, which causes inflammation of the membranes of the eye, when he and Wilson shared a hotel room, and returned to Los Angeles on Sunday. A source said: 'The couple were on the plane back to L.A. to spend New Year's Eve. They had a few drinks, but unfortunately the last time they checked in, they were sick. The source added that there was a chance that Mr Hanks will be' okay 'for New Year's Eve, but said he was' not great 'for the event. The source added:' He's fine now and he's got the flu. 'MailOnline has contacted representatives for Hanks and Wilson for comment. The pair was due to perform on Tuesday night at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem. They were due to go on stage together at a show celebrating Harry Hanks' 75th birthday. Last week the actor told Collider: 'I hope the illness won't affect me too much because I've always loved acting.' The Hollywood star is currently promoting his latest film Sully which is out in cinemas and on demand on Friday. Hanks also expressed his concern for the future of the acting industry after the recent deaths of directors Ben and Gary Whitta, both of whom were in their mid-30s. He said: 'I think there has to be an end to it. You just can't keep putting other people's careers at risk.' Both actors are said to be safe on set, and are expected to return to the stage in New York shortly. Tom and Rita are currently promoting their film Sully, which is out in cinemas and on demand on Friday. The movie stars Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, and Willem Dafoe."
100,"'It's crazy ': Panic buying forces stores to limit purchases of toilet paper and masks A US convenience store chain is threatening to stop making toilet paper from paper - with customers forced to order more than 30 of the products in their own homes. A new report by the Shops Council suggests it is the worst example of a ""lack of trust"" between staff and customers among stores. The report, which comes as millions of Americans are struggling to afford sanitary protection, says more than 500 pharmacies in the US have stopped selling toilet paper. The company behind the move says it's not its policy to sell paper from paper. Shoppers have been buying toilet paper in store. The company - based in Georgia - says it's not its policy to sell paper. Video courtesy of Storyful user Shana, Storyful CEO Tom Bogumire said there's a lack of trust between staff and customers. They're saying,' If you don't want that, you're going to stand in your bathroom and put dirty toilet paper in your basement. 'And it's basically like we're making the product all the way to the wall. And that's a problem. At the height of the crisis in 2006, there were 1,167 stores in the US, according to the Council on the Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. Storyful is a website where shoppers share their complaints from the toilet paper issue. The website has around 60,000 unique visitors per month, the most people in China. The website currently has close to a million unique visitors, that's an increase of 60 per cent. Storyful CEO Tom Bogumire said he was in talks with the company's management. Mr Bogumire told Storyful: ""We're going to make sure that we're paying attention to the customers. We want to make sure that these sanitary issues are shared with our customers and that we're doing everything we can to make sure that they're aware. His comments come after the number of families in the US who have to take steps to manage the toilet paper shortage doubled between 2010 and 2016. The council says that there is a"" high incidence ""of young children with eating sanitary products. The report is the latest in an increasing trend in which more than one billion Americans, or nearly half of the US population, are now in need of sanitary products.

101,"The koala population faces an immediate threat of extinction after the Australia bushfires, new report finds Wildlife experts say an estimated 80 per cent of the koalas in Australia are being lost due to the fires. TELL US BELOW: Do you know more about Australia's koala population? Is it threatened? What are the problems? Send us your stories via Facebook using the link below. The koalas have been saved from extinction thanks to a high number of native trees that have been transplanted into the area, which have been used to feed the animals. Australia's koala population could be at risk from an epidemic of disease. The Australian Koala Foundation has released an independent report into the country's koala populations which says the rate of extinction has dramatically increased in less than 10 years. ""This study confirms what we have been saying all along - that we need to invest and improve our koala health to maintain the ecosystem,"" Australia's environment minister, Greg Hunt, said. The report found that the koala population was in ""urgent crisis"" due to the lack of suitable habitat and disease. ""This is a critical area for koala survival,"" said Dr Dan Harrison, an ecologist at the University of Queensland. The Australia Koala Foundation's report estimates that there are about 80 per cent of the koala population in Australia and half of them are in remote areas of south-east Queensland. The report also found that koala numbers in cities were also falling, and in certain areas more needed to be done to increase protection for koalas and other wildlife. Dr Harrison said that if koala numbers were to decline at this rate, ""we could potentially lose between one and two per cent of the koala population in the coming decades."" ""If those koala populations are not curbed,"" he added, ""we may lose a few thousand koalas."" The report is the third such report and is the second from the Foundation, which was set up in December 2012. Dr Harrison said the report was also a warning to conservationists that the loss of koala habitat was not inevitable, and it would take more than a century to reverse the trend. He says that a key lesson for conservationists is not to assume that local governments will cut back on the koala population in the short-term. ""We need people to do their own research,"" he said."
102,"Australian paper prints blank pages to help tackle toilet paper shortage The Australian newspaper industry has been left frustrated after printing blank pages in an attempt to solve a growing toilet paper shortage. The Daily Telegraph reports that paper has been stretched to breaking point in the past few years, with some newspapers reporting a shortage of 10cm and 200g of paper in their newsstands. However, publishers say that their printing efforts are now helping to solve the problem, saying that they are now printing paper at twice the rate as they did a decade ago. According to the publication, the newspaper industry is struggling to cope with rising costs as people become more aware of the need for paper and the need to keep it at a good temperature. It has already introduced new printing methods, such as making 20in, 30in and 55in sheets ""as paper continues to be sold to keep up with demand,"" the paper reports. The paper also reports on reports that a shortage of about 20cm of paper has caused one newspaper to run two pages of a paper about a child's birthday. The paper's printing manager, Luke Rankin, told The Telegraph that if the paper ran a single page of paper, the issue would be fixed within 24 hours. He said: ""If the paper ran an equally tiny page or the larger page, there would be 100 sheets to go and we'd run all the paper to all the different sections."" Mr Rankin added that the paper printing process is less time consuming than the printed page printing process. However, he admitted that he has had to adapt how paper is manufactured from scratch. We've had to find other ways to printing the paper. A lot of people choose to print a paper in their spare time, ""Mr Rankin told the paper. We've been able to reduce our printing costs and still produce a paper for just over half of the paper we produce each day. In the meantime, the paper industry is now using paper from around the world to keep up with demand."" We are currently printing 200 sheets a week and another 200 on a daily basis, ""Mr Rankin added. The Daily Telegraph is a large print publication that is run by the Australian Associated Press. It's not the first time that the paper industry has struggled with the changing landscape. In 2011, John Batchelor, the managing director of the Daily Mail and General Trust, told The Guardian newspaper that paper production had fallen below its peak"
103,"The climate crisis made Australia's fires at least 30% more likely, study finds ""When the fires were beginning, the risk of fires in Australia was likely to be more than 10% higher than in the US,"" the paper said. That estimate - based on estimates of temperature, rainfall and precipitation - was based on five climate records produced in the year before the fires. ""This suggests that the US was at greater risk of a major fire,"" the climate scientists said. The study, which is published in the journal Nature Climate Change, also found that Australia's previous hotter-than-average winter was also linked to a rise in wildfires. In the southern Flinders Ranges, the number of fires had increased by more than a million in the past two years, the study said. The study also found that Australia's fires were more intense in the spring, when temperatures soared. Scientists said they hoped the findings could lead to better predictions of future fires. ""This study shows that climate change is changing what is happening in Australia,"" said Professor Mark Bellis, a fire scientist at the University of Melbourne. The idea that this might be due to global warming is just that bit more significant. But it's extremely hard to know if this is because of global warming or really because of climate change. More than 40 years of global warming and the associated melting of ice and snow have caused the Antarctic Peninsula to grow more rapidly than it has in the past, experts say. But the researchers said this was likely to be due to human activities, which contributed to the recent emergence of fires. The study was funded by the Australian Research Council, the Australian Research Council and the National Science Foundation. Dr Martine Beer, head of the Climate Change Research Program at the Australian National University, said the study used previous research by the University of Melbourne's Centre for Climate and Environmental Research. ""It's a very difficult problem to quantify in a single context,"" she said. In a global scale, the risk of fires is three times greater than in a small town in Australia. So if you are dealing with fires or other natural disasters, all these different problems would be more important. ""It doesn't mean that there will be a big change in climate, but it does mean that we've got to plan for future fires,"" she said. Follow Roger on Twitter @ rharrabin. Follow Karen on Facebook.

104,"An Australian thief used a fishing rod to steal a Versace necklace worth more than $300,000, police said Tuesday. The 19-year-old attacker, who was not identified, was jailed for two to 10 weeks for the crime. The Versace necklace, which the British fashion house said belonged to the woman's late father, was unearthed by maintenance workers searching for the family's old home in the Australian state of Queensland. ""The man has ripped out the whole thing,"" Detective Inspector Tony Langdon, of the Brisbane Police Service, told reporters. The man had placed a piece of wood in the hole in the ground to keep it from being swallowed. It was unheard of before the man attached some of his own wood to the outside of the palm of his hand. He then grabbed the expensive necklace with his bare hands, pulled the trigger, and took it with him. It's not known if the victim was the victim's father. The jewelry was found by a maintenance worker who had been called the following day to clean the hole. Police said the thief was ""extremely lucky"" as he had not realised how long it had been missing. They said he had robbed a gold coin purse worth about $3,500 before fleeing. The thief also stole a gold necklace worth about $80,000. ""When you get a theft like this it's really worrying,"" Queensland Police Service Inspector Langdon said. It's hard to believe someone would do that because it's not usually that much of a risk. It's usually somebody coming in overnight to take something. Police said the man is likely to appeal the sentence. The Versace necklace is valued at between $400,000 and $500,000, and police have offered a reward of up to $250,000 for information leading to the return of the jewels. The Versace jewels are displayed at the Versace store in Milan, Italy, on May 24, 2006. Photos: AP Photo / Alberto Pizzoli Originally published as Thieves steal $300,000 artwork from Versace house in Queensland ""He's not going to get away with it,"" Inspector Langdon said.

Photo: Tom Huntley The largest bushfire raging through Australia's New South Wales this summer is finally under control after a week of being controlled by more than 240 days of inactivity. Since Monday morning, Victoria's Tonnes blaze had burned through 133,000 hectares and destroyed 22,200 homes, most of them in the state's north-west. But the danger level for the week has eased marginally to ""watch and act,"" the bureau said on Friday, indicating the fire now has ""almost zero"" containment. The total fire ban for Victoria is now in place. Firefighters remained on standby on Thursday to guard against any large fires which could grow in size or develop into a large bushfire. ""It is important that people in the area prepare plans to protect their homes,"" a NSW Rural Fire Service spokesman said. While the fire alert remains at ""high"", people in affected areas have been told to evacuate. Fires that started on Monday are now being controlled by 232 days of lightning. The hot, dry conditions have led to large fires burning across the state. A separate fire raging through Victoria's northwest had been brought under control on Wednesday night. The blaze, which started in the state's northwest, had burnt through more than 11,000 hectares and destroyed 21,200 homes. Victoria has also been under a state of emergency since the weekend. The Country Fire Authority, which has been fighting other fires, said on Friday that the fire season had been one of the most active since the end of the Victorian bushfires in the 1970s. An overnight cool change brought a drought-stricken outlook over the Australian summer, with temperatures likely to dip below 10 degrees celsius this week. But this year's warm weather has meant the grass and woodlands of about 30,000 acres have grown in size in the past week. The State Emergency Service said people should: Move vehicles under cover; Secure or put away loose items around your house; Keep clear of creeks and storm drains. Avoid vigorous exercise, such as running; Secure or put away loose items around your home. Follow WAtoday on Twitter @ WAtoday and Facebook.

This week we'll also look at the latest figures on deaths from flu and malaria in Northern Ireland, and the latest reports on the number of people using the winter vomiting bug as their first line of defence against the disease. The new information comes from the Department of Health. This week we'll focus on which deaths have occurred in Northern Ireland related to this winter's flu outbreak. Here we take a look at the latest figures on deaths from flu and malaria in Northern Ireland. The number of deaths from flu and malaria in Northern Ireland increased from 396 to 480 in the second quarter of 2017. There were over 2,400 cases of the virus between January and March. There were 107 deaths from malaria between January and April. There were more than 7,000 cases of the disease between May and July of this year. There were 113 cases of malaria between May and June of this year. There were 405 new cases of malaria between May and July of this year. This is a rise of just over 17% from May to July this year. The number of people who are in hospital with malaria rose from 2,276 in January to 3,720 in July. This is an increase of almost 20% from the same period last year. The number of patients who have been admitted to hospital with the illness during this winter's outbreak in Northern Ireland dropped from 1,797 to 1,782. All but 12 of the patients admitted to hospital with malaria were admitted to hospital during March. The number of patients admitted to hospital with respiratory infections increased from 1,246 to 1,276 between January and July this year. There were 244 cases of malaria between January and July. While the number of patients admitted to hospital with malaria has been reduced by almost 20% this year, malaria has been reported as a major cause of death among those who are not admitted to hospital. There were also two new cases reported in England and Wales. These were in the form of malaria and influenza. In Northern Ireland, there were 510 cases of malaria between January and July this year. This is up from 532 cases in the same period last year and up from 390 in the same period in 2014. There were also five new cases of the disease in England and Wales."

It is the coldest temperatures in the UK for a decade and is expected to hit a high of -3C (23F) on Tuesday. The last time it was below freezing temperature was in November 2009, when it was -4C (-2F) in Cannock, Staffordshire. A spokesman for the Met Office said the north-east will be the coldest of the winter, with a high of -4C (23F) expected to hit some places. He said: ""The cold weather will cause sleet and snow on high ground in Northern Ireland, Scotland and northern England, and further north. The snow is expected to settle in the Highlands or Scotland. The cold air is expected to start to spread northwards across Europe by this evening and the rest of the week, pushing through eastern and central Europe. The cold will stay away from southern Europe until Saturday at the earliest. The cold will be replaced by a milder blast of northerly air from the continent, which will bring colder air. The cold air will be replaced by a cold front from the north, which will bring milder air. At the weekend, a study suggested the virus does not have to be transmitted between people. The researchers, from the University of Washington, said it could instead be passed on from person-to-person. However, they said it was unlikely to cause symptoms due to the different ways people carry the virus. The virus has infected more than 330 people in 28 countries in the last three months. Some of the victims are children under the age of five. BBC weather forecaster Caroline Rolland said:"" We have seen some very mild and damp weather but the cold weather is going to continue. ""The Department of Health said there was no evidence of the virus spreading to others. Follow Matt on Twitter... and on Facebook. and Twitter..."
108,"This tiny lion with teeth like bolt-cutters once roamed Australia, a big cat was spotted in NSW's Goulburn Valley, near the Great Pyramid, but no-one has seen it in 40 years. Bears are considered a ""pest"" by many wildlife charities, which say they are in danger of extinction and they can be killed by farmers and other hunters. The creatures were spotted near the Goulburn Valley during a two-week period in October this year. Photo: Courtesy of the Goulburn Valley Safari Club The lioness, which was in a cage, had its claws and claws cut off and was covered with dirt and rubbish. The animals were reportedly spotted by police patrolling the area, who seized the animals for welfare. A spokesperson for the Goulburn Valley Safari Club said the lion was likely a female. ""She was a real cutie and seemed a little overprotective of the large male,"" the spokesperson said. She had a huge claw and she had wounds on her face and was covered in dirt. The park also said there was a large male spotted near the cage. ""He was very frightened and had had a small injury on his shoulder,"" the spokesperson said. It looks like he has been mauled. We are very lucky to have had some kind of rescue, so that he can be put down. But if it doesn't happen, we will be relocating him as soon as possible. The Goulburn Valley Safari Club said on Facebook that it had been in contact with the man and was grateful for the chance to have captured the lioness. ""The lioness (pictured) was obviously scared and we are very lucky to have had some kind of rescue, so that he can be put down as soon as possible,"" the spokeswoman said. We know he is a very special person and we are pleased that this particular cutie made it to the cages, as he was quite frightened and a bit overprotective. If he only found food, like any other lion, he will probably not stay alive, but he's now a happy little cutie to us. The lioness has been taken to the RSPCA's Haven Wildlife Rescue Centre in Goulburn to be put down. The organisation said that the man who caught the lion was an experienced rescuer. ""We don't recommend these sorts of rescues,"
109,"Baboons break out of captivity and go on the run near Sydney hospital ""It is likely that the animals were brought together because it is rare for the two species to come together in captivity,"" Mr Barneley said. The area where the incident took place is known for its abundance of wildlife. It is estimated there are as few as 3,000 baboons in the wild. The baboons have been handed over to the NSW Department of Primary Industries. The department is yet to be able to identify which of the beasts is the baboon. At about 12.20pm local time, police responded to a report of a large baboon in a creek near the hospital. Police and RSPCA officers located the baboons and took them to Wentworth Park. Officers say the baboons are now being cared for in a local wildlife sanctuary. ""This is a sad incident and our thoughts are with the family involved,"" RSPCA Australia regional manager of investigations Chris Gray said. Beau is a wonderful mum and is currently resting in a sanctuary. We would ask anyone who recognises this male to contact police immediately on 131 444. The baboons have been named Beau and Lili by the RSPCA. Beau is receiving treatment at the RSPCA Wentworth Park. Originally published as Baboons break out of captivity and go on the run near hospital ""It's not uncommon for baboons to mate and breed, but this is the first baboon to be born in a sanctuary,"" Mr Gray said. It is a reminder that baboons are the most dangerous animal in any environment, but we urge anyone who sees them to call our Wildcare Helpline on (02) 9444. According to the RSPCA, baboons can survive up to six months in high-stress environments so the chances of them surviving for so long is extremely slim. The current baboon is being monitored by a veterinary nurse at Sydney's Taronga Zoo. ""The welfare of the baboons is the most important consideration for any wildlife protection agency,"" Mr Gray said. While we are unable to comment directly on this incident, the welfare of the animal is the main priority.

The World Health Organisation has already declared the outbreak a global health emergency, and the United Nations has launched a response, with plans for a rapid response to provide support. The coronavirus, which is spread by contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person, is thought to have originated in Africa and is now infecting the Pacific Islands. It is the most common source of infection in the world, affecting the tropics, and has also been reported in South Africa and the Caribbean. Britain has confirmed cases of the disease, with health officials reporting four possible cases in a week. The disease causes vomiting, diarrhoea, and muscle pain. The virus causes symptoms including fever, headache, constipation, stomach cramps, blurred vision, nausea and vomiting. Health officials advise that anyone who has been outside for more than 24 hours should remain indoors and avoid contact with those affected. The most common course of treatment is to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. There is no vaccine for the virus, though people can get an effective dose if they are not feeling well. The virus is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluid of an infected person, often through contaminated food or water. An estimated 12,000 cases are reported each year in the UK with more than 350 deaths. The deadly virus can be found in many parts of the world, particularly in eastern Africa.

The man died at the scene from serious injuries, police said. His death comes after a 22-year-old man was charged with threatening to kill the elderly man. The man allegedly was assaulted on Monday, a day after he posted on Facebook that he was ""the one trying to take care of him."" ""I want to die,"" he said. Police said the victim had previously been involved in an assault. The man had allegedly driven his car over the barricade to stop an elderly man from entering the driveway of his home, police said. The 77-year-old man allegedly chased the car before police arrested him and brought him to the ground, where he allegedly tried to stop the car and fell. Police said the incident lasted several minutes before the driver fled the scene. Neither the driver nor the man can be named because of their age. There have been a spate of stabbing attacks in Melbourne in recent weeks. Two men were attacked and another was stabbed in a stabbing attack. In Melbourne, an 18-year-old man died in hospital on Sunday after being stabbed at the scene of a violent altercation in Mt Druitt on Monday. Police have said a 19-year-old man from Mt Druitt, who sustained stab wounds to his upper body, is in a stable condition in hospital. The stabbing is the fifth violent attack on young people in Melbourne in just 45 days. On June 13, a man was stabbed three times by a group of men near a McDonald's restaurant in Toorak. And in Sydney, an 18-year-old boy was stabbed while walking to school on February 6. The 18-year-old was attacked by up to six men as he left a gym.

Tom Owens' work, known as ""The Diner,"" depicts a figure wearing a red velvet dress with a bow tie. It was later auctioned for £1,600. The owners of the pub, in Hove, East Sussex, said they were not aware of the tattoo until now. The couple went to the pub to see a woman who had used the name of the pub as a reference. Their friend, who has lived there for more than 50 years, said she had been surprised to find the owners were not in the pub. ""I was quite surprised to see how much they were out there,"" she said. Mrs Owens said the owner was ""very friendly, very friendly"" but declined to reveal any further details. She told how the pub had a gentlemen's room that can hold up to 12 people. ""It was the same as they used to, but I guess it was a little older, as there wasn't much room,"" she said. She said she had been in the pub for about 35 years.

His wife, who worked with him at the pub for around 30 years, said she did not know when the photograph came up but that it was a gift from Tom Owens' friend. The owners of the pub have put their house on the market for £2,500, but have not yet decided on a new owner. They have put it on the market for £2,500 but it will be sold at auction next month. It is not the first time the Owens' work has been put on the auction block. Last year a portrait of a woman that was part of an oil painting sold for £1,600."

116,"The cities designed to be capitals of innovation have been built to withstand future shocks. But it's also crucial to see what's to come. If you're interested in being part of the future, here are some ideas to help you work out what's around the corner. The city of Oakland has launched the city's first ever ""urban tech ecosystem"" for urban professionals. The city of Vancouver developed the Green and Blue Zone, which is a new area of public space in the B.C. city. It will include a community hub with shops, cafes, a day care centre, a health centre and a community hospital. Vancouver has a great record of innovation, with the first city to use its ""Green Touch"" approach to bring tech to the city, and the second to use this approach to connect with its neighbours. However, the city of Vancouver's first Green Touch centre in the North Shore has come in second to the idea. It's also essential to see what's next. On July 1, Green Touch will open its doors to North Shore residents. It will be located in a building called ""Kill Tech,"" which will be able to produce ecosystems that will be of benefit to humans and other creatures. Developers will be able to distribute the ecosystems to other communities. The Green Touch centre will help the community develop sustainability projects and help communities plan for the future. In all, it will feature a community park designed to sustain the city's ecosystem. It will also be a safe and eco-friendly space. It's a great start to Green Touch's new era after a tough few years. But the city must also continue to develop its tech ecosystem. It's not yet clear what the government will do about the Green Touch project, but the city is already working on a program to encourage energy efficient use of the city's parks. It's expected that a government study will be launched by the end of the year to evaluate how best to implement his vision. But the Green Touch initiative will not have a lasting effect on the city's ecosystem, but it's a good start. The Green Touch partnership between developers and city governments will help the city continue to modernize the city. The Green Touch partnership provides the city with the tools to make sustainable urban use of its parks and spaces more accessible. The city should play an important role in that process."

The latest plans from the U.S. Department of Transportation to eliminate the need for a ""toddler seating"" were announced Thursday by American Airlines and the advocacy group Children's Travel. The policy changes will enforce existing policies with the expectation that ""a new parent will be on-board,"" said Lisa Jackson, a spokeswoman for the group. The policy changes also require parents to ""carefully review their child's airplane routing and the consequences of his or her absence,"" Jackson said. Some of the new requirements also include a ban on forcing children to sit together on airplanes. They also require airlines to offer a safety course, an assessment of lost bags, and training for flight attendants. The policy changes ""will provide a safe, secure, and healthy environment for all children and their families,"" Jackson said. It also ""will set a new standard that is consistent with what we have known in the past,"" she said. ""We are proud to stand on the shoulders of our most vulnerable passengers -- children and families -- and work to make them safe, comfortable and loved,"" said American Airlines CEO Doug Parker in a statement. The airline said it would expand the standards to six additional regional hubs, including Miami, San Francisco, New York / Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, Seattle, Tampa, Washington and Boston. The new restrictions apply to children up to age 16, and anyone traveling with children younger than 16. The latest updates will include the introduction of new seating for children on select flights. These children are usually seated in the same row, in aisles one through four, the airline said. ""The new guidelines reflect the airline's commitment to helping parents make the right choice for their children,"" Jackson said. Passengers who are not satisfied with the airline's seating policy can file a lawsuit with the Department of Transportation."
118,"Chinese restaurants are losing business over coronavirus fears, says chef A chef who is on a food poisoning mission to test the health of food is warning that local restaurateurs are not immune from the illness. Jen Wang, a 30-year-old native of Shenzhen, has been working to establish the proper protocols for the food supply chain and a better understanding of the virus. In a video posted on her blog, the British chef says she is working to reduce the number of outbreaks of food poisoning by supplementing the supply chain with food from overseas. ""I want to stress again that we are not immune to food poisoning, so the best you can do is to find a safe and reliable source of food,"" she said. It's important that you have food that is safe, that's fit for people to eat, and that's safe to eat. Jen Wang said she hopes to test restaurants using their own supply chains. ""Every year, we get a lot of outbreaks of food poisoning and that's always a risk because of the high number of food poisoning incidents,"" she said. And you can also be exposed to bacteria so people get sick because of the food they eat and those people are vulnerable to more cases. So if you have to eat a lot of food, you can't just throw it away. It's not only about food safety, but also about food safety. Last year, Jen set up her own company, Jade's Kitchen, which employs 40 people across the UK. The company is based in Shenzhen, not Guangzhou. According to the World Health Organisation, the majority of food poisoning cases around the world were caused by Chinese households that have closed their gates to foreigners. The disease is relatively rare in China so the risk to other residents is low. But the food chain is at risk of being wiped out if the food poisoning outbreak ever turns into something similar. Jade's Kitchen is currently working with affected restaurants to ensure they are ensuring safety standards are met. Jade's Kitchen currently employs 35 people. It recently opened its first US outlet in New York. In the viral outbreak, Jade's Kitchen has made headlines the world over for failing to disclose the source of the outbreak.

Israel Folau won his first Australia jersey in his debut for the Wallabies on Saturday. The fan, who did not wish to be named, was reprimanded by a Canberra Stadium stadium steward in 2013 after tweeting that she would not return to her seat directly after Folau's debut match with the Wallabies. While stewards met with the fan on Wednesday in an official capacity, they were told to eject her from the stadium. The fan was issued with a $150 fine for breaching the conditions of the stadium's rule not to wear a rainbow flag, which carries a $365 fine and a $322 fine. The steward also came to the club with a sign urging the fan to leave the stadium immediately. The woman told Fairfax Media the steward had reminded her that she was not allowed to wear the rainbow flag and that she would be fined if she refused to comply with the rules. This is just me. This is not a family matter, ""she said. It's not a game. I came to see the first game and there's a lot of big names in it and I don't want to get in the way of the big names.

122,"Volcano victims: New Zealand orders 1,292 square feet of skin for patients injured in eruption More than 1,292 square feet of skin from the eruption have been donated to medical charities, including the country's largest national cancer treatment center. The disease, called granulocytes, has destroyed a kidney and spleen and left the patient in a coma, an announcement from New Zealand's Ministry of Health and Wellness said Sunday. The group, known as the SkinCure foundation, is working with Macquarie University to treat patients in the region where the volcano erupted Saturday. They are also seeking to donate their skin, tissue and blood. The SkinCure foundation confirmed the donations and said it is donating 1,292 square feet of skin to help individuals who have been directly affected by the eruption and who are still suffering from the long-term effects, including kidney failure. Two-thirds of the patients have already undergone treatment for their cancers. The organization is also asking for the donation to be sent to a cancer hospital in Wellington, the country's largest city. The SkinCure foundation's president-in-waiting, Andy Hay, has told the BBC that the organization has been overwhelmed by messages from the public about their support of the group. More than 4,000 people are affected by granulocytes and 11,000 suffered skin and muscle cancer. The volcano is one of the most active in New Zealand and is considered one of the country's most hazardous. A 2010 eruption at the nearby Crater Rim killed 126 people and destroyed large parts of the city. National park rangers have been temporarily rerouting the nearby Eyre Peninsula, and the SkinCure foundation plans to have a memorial at New Plymouth Castle on the island of the north ship of the peninsula. The site was established in 1842 to protect the historic town of Parvaux, whose name means ""the new pond"" in French. The current eruption has not disrupted the park's activities, but the National Park Service said in a statement that it is ""closely monitoring"" the situation and will continue to monitor developments. The park service has been instructed to use the best available equipment, including a helicopter, to bring in extra staff to help. It is still not clear how widespread the ash is or how long it will last."
123,"Fight is not over, says winner of vaginal mesh implant court victory It has been a long, drawn-out saga, and as the verdict was read out in the Court of Appeal in London, lawyers for the patients were cheered by supporters holding up placards reading ""Justice for the Dignity of all."" ""We are delighted and proud that this action has been successful,"" said Professor Sir Rory Collins, medical director of the NICE. Over the last few years we have refined our approach to managing complications of urinary incontinence, to ensure women are treated with respect and dignity, and patients are protected from unnecessary implant procedures. Having carefully considered all the evidence in this case, we have concluded that the medical benefits outweigh the risks to the patient. An NICE spokesman said: ""We recognize that a number of patients have experienced adverse events following the use of pelvic mesh procedures and we are currently reviewing the evidence to ensure that the safety of this procedure is maintained."" The women will now be able to undergo further surgery to have a womb created from the mesh. The court would be advised if they chose to do so or if they do not wish to have more surgical treatment. The court will hear oral arguments on the case at a later date. Dr Amit Soni, the solicitor who represented the patients, said: ""We are delighted and proud of this victory and the fact that this ruling has been upheld by the court of appeal. We are confident that it will reduce the risk of complications for women who have had a mesh implant and at the same time help to prevent the loss of life caused by mesh complications. The court is clear that many women who have undergone mesh surgery have experienced serious complications. The fact is that there is always a risk when surgical mesh therapy is used in conjunction with pelvic organ prolapse surgery, which can lead to painful urinary incontinence or incontinence. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said:"" The court has found in favour of Prof Soni in this case. This has opened the door for any further legal action against the manufacturer of vaginal mesh implants. It is too early to speculate on how this verdict will impact other cases. A final verdict is expected at the end of October. The number of women affected by the mesh scandal has steadily risen."
124,"Flames are chewing up my country, ""wrote one of the letter's signatories, Abdul Abdullah, a member of the Wajeha party, on Twitter on Thursday."" We are against any person's country and the Koran, ""he wrote. We are against any ideology and any political parties. It's not our government's business. Western governments and private groups have also been calling for the reinstatement of Sharia law at a time when the Taliban is trying to regain strength and impose an Islamist rule across the country after being routed in a US-led invasion in 2001. The Taliban says Islamic law is similar to the Afghan constitution and has been empowered by a US push to train and arm Afghan police and army. The insurgents have made particular efforts to establish an Islamist regime in Afghanistan. In April, they attacked the UN headquarters in the Afghan capital Kabul with suicide bombers, sparking a sustained assault on the building that killed more than 100 people. In a separate incident, the Taliban killed eight civilians and policemen in an attack on a military convoy in Kandahar on Tuesday in the south of the war-torn country. No group claimed responsibility for the Kabul attack, but the Taliban have frequently attacked Afghan security forces and government officials and there have been some attempts to target the government. In addition to the Afghan attack, the Taliban have stepped up attacks on civilians in the country's north in recent months, targeting a police training camp in the province of Kunduz. In late September, a suicide car bomber killed seven people and wounded nine in an attack in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif. The Taliban have killed thousands of civilians in a campaign to topple the Western-backed government of President Hamid Karzai. They are also active in Nangarhar, where a US soldier was shot dead last week and in the south recently. The Taliban have been blamed for other attacks in Afghanistan, including an attack at the US embassy in Kabul in March, which killed about 60 people. In another incident, a soldier was shot dead and two other soldiers were wounded in the south of the country, according to Afghan officials. Meanwhile in western Herat province, Afghan police shot dead a suicide bomber in the city of Jalalabad, the provincial governor's spokesman, Fazle Stanekzai, said. The attacker detonated his vest in the crowd, which was gathering at a checkpoint."
125,"Lewis the koala's death is a sad end to a terrible tale ""There are a lot of amazing koalas in North America who are suffering because of the hunting industry and that's why we have a ban on hunting them,"" she said. While the ban is not in place, we are doing our best to try and stop it happening. Another koala, Katrina, who has been sick for several months, died of dehydration and infection in June. There had been growing concern over the case, which the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs described as ""tragic."" But the coroner said he expected the ban to be lifted shortly. Rats killed for sport include cows, goats and deer. But despite the ban, there are huge numbers of koalas in the wild in North America. The animals are protected from hunting because they are ""habituated"" to humans and for their wellbeing. The ban on hunting is legal under UK wildlife law and if it is not overturned, it can be challenged in the courts. The RSPCA said it was working to provide support to Koalas as they recover. ""It is devastating not only to the Koalas and their keepers but to the ecosystem in which they live,"" Mr Sanderson said. Rats are our main living ancestors, our greatest natural resources and our most important part of our ecosystem. It's time we stopped this tragic death of one of our most iconic animals. The RSPCA said the ban on hunting should be lifted immediately. It said it would continue to work with the RSPCA to ensure that koalas could return to the wild. An RSPCA spokesman said: ""We have a huge number of koalas in North America which are suffering because of the hunting industry and that's why we have a ban on hunting them,"" he said. They are endangered which means they are threatened with extinction. The ban on hunting koalas is illegal in the UK. The RSPCA has been encouraging people to sign the petition to save the animals. Under UK law, the animal's life must be protected. ""It is a very sad end to a terrible story and we are hopeful that the ban will be lifted soon,"" Mr Sanderson added. Mr Sanderson said the ban on hunting koalas had led to a loss of about five million koalas in the last 20 years."
126,"Australia's Gladys Liu scandal shows how the Chinese Communist Party is weaponizing race as a political weapon By Malcolm Moore in Shanghai Last Updated: 7: 04PM BST 09 Apr 2009 The country's political system now has a far more aggressive form of racial discrimination than in the 1960s, when it stood accused of carrying out murder, sodomy, rape, forced disappearances and forced marriages of Chinese women. In Australia the 1950s, both white and black men were the subject of horrific attacks and forced marriages. The Chinese Communist Party has been blamed for the most severe form of abuse. The Chinese women were often tortured and executed. Mr Li, who is now a prominent political commentator on China Central Television, said the problem is much less severe in Australia than in the 1960s because the Chinese state has managed to control the population effectively. ""The Chinese Communist Party has managed to control the population effectively and I think that is more because they have been able to do this on a very large scale,"" he said. They have created a pretty bad environment for the population. The Chinese Communist Party has been under pressure to find ways to balance the rights of women and minorities by opening up to them. But the Chinese Communist Party has done little to promote this agenda. In 2004, the Labor opposition demanded more funding for ""universal economic rights."" ""Despite its power, the new Chinese government has failed to put into practice any kind of national policy for women and minorities,"" said Mr Li. Meanwhile, Sydney University Professor Irene Spence, a co-director of the Centre for Chinese Studies at Australia's University of Technology, said China had a long way to go. ""The Communist Party is now much more aggressive,"" she said. Their most powerful machinery is cyber crime. They're constantly using new tools and new techniques in order to control the information and disseminate information. Human rights groups say the government is still not providing sufficient protection to women and minorities. A recent United Nations report found that there are around 2,000 women and girls in China, at a rate of about 1,000 a year. The report said a quarter had been trafficked into prostitution, which is the ""lowest level"" to date among women and girls. The problem of forced marriage and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases is also showing the strain on women's health. The UN report said some of the women who were raped had already given birth to boys."

A new study has found the extinction crisis is far worse than you thought. Photo: University of Sydney The extinction crisis is far worse than you thought, according to a new study by the University of Sydney. A new study has found the extinction crisis is far worse than you thought. The research, which is published in the journal PLOS One, found the extinction crisis is far worse than you thought. The researchers analyzed data on more than 1000 species of plants and animals. They found that populations of fish, reptiles, amphibians, snakes, birds, amphibians, birds, fish and mammals were at risk of extinction. ""Our results suggest that changes in habitat, intensification of climate, and loss of food have played a part in extinction,"" said lead author Dr Steve Galsworthy, from the Faculty of Sciences. This is important given the abundance of plant and animal species in the region, but the impact of declining populations on biodiversity is difficult to quantify. The study looked at samples of plant and animal species from the Australian desert and the Indonesian island of Sumatra, as well as those from India and Bangladesh. In the past 40 years, the extinction crisis has been worse than had been thought, the researchers found. The largest population losses were observed in the tropical forests of north-eastern India and the Philippines. ""The extinction crisis is far worse than we thought,"" Dr Galsworthy said. We found that species that are threatened by human invaders are at risk of extinction, but that they are not. The extinction crisis is much worse than we thought. The species that are most likely to face extinction are plants and animals that are threatened by humans. The study found that the extinction crisis was concentrated in the tropical forests of north-eastern India and the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The research team did not speculate on the reasons for the big drops in plant and animal populations in the past 40 years, but Galsworthy said the results would help to highlight the importance of preserving biodiversity. ""Our results show that the extinction crisis is far worse than you thought"
128,"'We are failing the elephants' The former head of the National Public Prosecution Service (NPCC), Sir Keir Starmer, has told how the government is failing the victims of serious crime. In a speech to the Oxford Union, Sir Keir described David Cameron as ""an arrogant, self-centred, venal, selfish, self-involved, self-obsessed, self-indulgent, self-righteous, self-absorbed, posh."" He said an ""insidious culture of entitlement"" in the UK is to blame. A culture where ""the public can expect a slice of the pie above all others,"" he added. Sir Keir told the Oxford Union: ""I have been a huge admirer of David Cameron for the last six years and I believe his approach is perfectly suited to the challenges confronting the country and the government."" The former Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Keir faced calls to resign after it emerged that he had sent a text message to a 17-year-old girl while also receiving payments from members of the public. Sir Keir added: ""I would like to remind the public that we work incredibly hard to bring order and accountability to the criminal justice system and to make clear that it is only through effective reform that we can truly trust the public to act in the best interests of victims."" He said that after a year of ""steady and steady improvement"" in the conviction rate of children, there had been a 14% fall in the number of children being held for longer than six months. He said: ""While the criminal justice system is now stronger than it was in early 2010, with fewer children being detained for longer than six months, it is not yet nearly as strong as it was at the moment."" Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: ""What we need is a radical re-organisation of the criminal justice system and changes to the way crime is calculated."" He said he would ""do all that I can to stop the Tories from transforming the criminal justice system."" A government spokesman said: ""We are making great progress in bringing offenders to justice. We are also investing £300m a year to transform community sentences, through a review of the sentencing and rehabilitation system, including moving away from the"" fit for purpose ""regime for short prison sentences.""

131,"Plastic island: How our trash is destroying paradise An artist's impression of a proposed new ""island,"" which would stretch from the Isle of Wight to the tip of South America. Photograph: Dan Kitwood / Getty Images A new ""island"" is expected to open in British waters this winter - just like the fictitious ""island of the Oceans"" which lies next to the Isle of Wight. The scheme would extend from a patch of water in the Thames Estuary to a lake in the South of England. And even if you haven't seen an overlapping, dusty island, the idea of a ""super-island"" is likely to appeal to those with an interest in sustainable use. The proposed ""island"" would stretch from the Isle of Wight to the tip of South America, according to a report commissioned by the Marine Conservation Society (MCS). The organisation has been calling for a project to be put forward by the Government to give the island's ecological infrastructure the ""best possible chance of success."" The island would be built on the Isle of Wight, although not on the coast. A spokesperson for the group said the scheme will be a ""logical next step,"" which would ""support sustainable, renewable energy and other projects that benefit the environment."" The idea of a super-island comes from the film Prometheus, which is set in the world of the past, and focuses on a fictitious island from the seashore of Hogwarts. But environmentalists point out that the film is based on the real-life Thames Estuary, which is a much smaller structure than the Oceans. A spokeswoman for the MCS said: ""We are concerned that the potential impact of the super-island will be different to that of the Thames Estuary."" The plans were submitted to the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Owen Paterson, who had requested the MCS to study the idea. The spokesman said: ""The aim of this new island for Thames Estuary is to provide sustainable, renewable energy and other projects that benefit the environment. The scheme will be a huge step forward. It could even help to protect the breeding grounds of endangered species such as the Great Barrier Reef and the Great Barrier Reef."

It was the only time in the history of the First World War that Scottish soldiers fought in Germany. The poem is also being featured on a new Scottish project called The Gags of Scotland, which will be presented at a similar event at St Andrews University in April, to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn, when the Scots defeated the English in a fight that claimed around 100 lives.

134,"Sixth extinction: 20 years to stop ecological collapse, scientists warn Ecologist John Williams, of the National Centre for Behavioural Research, said: ""The last time the last remaining members were extinct was when the dinosaurs vanished. That is a very distant day, but there is no doubt that the last remaining animals were extinct in this area. The last time a dinosaur disappeared in the UK was in the 1970s, when it was thought the dinosaurs were extinct. They disappeared in a big way, but we cannot conclude they are gone now. The new research, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, shows that while declining populations of animals like crocodiles have reduced overall river levels, the decline was accelerated by the introduction of new species such as fish and other fish species. This suggests the last remaining dinosaurs are not in trouble but the study suggests that the decline may have started in the last few decades. Dr Williams said:"" A third of the UK's river water is now being drained by the rise in river levels and the decline is in danger of becoming more severe. The river in England has been under-exploited for centuries, so we need to look at how we can help people at risk of losing their natural habitat to this loss. There have been reports that the UK's waterways could be flooded by the impact of global warming in a phenomenon known as' ecological stress' - which could see Britain lose its entire rivers within the next 50 years. The Royal Society's new report comes as a separate study published in the journal Nature argues that climate change is having an impact on the planet's rivers. Some three million people are at risk of flooding because of rising water levels and acidification, but the study also points to the need for action. Professor Martin Bowles, of the Royal Holloway, University of London, said the country was ""losing all its rivers for good"" but that the country was making rapid progress on reducing its pollution and protecting its wildlife. ""If an area could be protected for future generations then it would be the perfect place to start,"" he said. The study also looked at how flooding affected the Thames Wet Tropics which have been in decline since the late 1990s. The research found that the river had risen by more than 10 times since the 1940s, while other areas in the Thames Delta had fallen more"

The deadliest mass extinction in human history is now about to happen. Scientists believe the last mass extinction caused by climate change is about to happen. The last time the Earth was hit by a devastating act was in the 19th century, when the dinosaurs took over. In the wake of the current event, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has started an investigation into how and when to cut carbon emissions. It hopes to map out the future of the planet and examine ways to limit global warming to 2C. BBC science correspondent Rebecca Morelle gives BBC News access to the latest data. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The last time a catastrophic event was recorded was in the early 1990s The study will take only two years. That is longer than the average scientific study of that time. The scientists of the University of Hawaii at Manoa are trying to analyse individual fossil sharks using the IUCN Red List. That list is a database of the world's most significant species of shark. They also know that sharks are increasingly being caught up in environmental changes. Researchers are concerned that the problem will get worse. Another important aim of the study is to document how the world will be affected by climate change. The team from the University of Hawaii at Manoa have already done this. In 2000, the US Geological Survey said that the world's temperature would rise by 1 C during the next century and up to 0.5 C by 2100. The study will run from two-to-three days, for seven weeks. Once the data is ready, it will be transferred to a field bank where the information can be used to map the future of the planet. The team will also use the data to assess climate change and how people have been affected. The results will have a significant impact on the way scientists think about climate change, the scientists say. While there are many different factors that contribute to the Earth's climate, the most important factor is how we respond to it. It is important that we can make a decision that improves the resilience of the planet to the impacts of climate change, ""says Dr John Williams from the University of Hawaii. The study is expected to be complete in 2018. Follow Rebecca on Twitter."

According to The Paper, the owner arranged to buy Joya from an animal shelter in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province. While in the shelter, the owner took Joya back to the shelter and gave him to her. After the man arrived back home, Joya took off with the man's foot after his trip to the shelter, while she took a friend back to the vet. The pet shop owner told The Paper, the man did not like the man's pet name. She said the owner did not want to have the man tag her while she stayed in the shelter, so she called the police. Footage of Joya's friend flying the length of their way has gone viral on China's popular Twitter-like Weibo The man was then taken to a veterinarian hospital where he was given a clean bill of health. Apparently, he was okay, according to onlookers, and then he was able to fly back to China without the incident. According to an unnamed vet quoted in South China Morning Post, the man was admitted to Shenzhen Animal Hospital for a check up. He was reported to suffer slight scratches on his right foot, but no major injuries. The man said he had left the woman home to go to the pet shop to buy a pet treat. However, he is thought to have stayed in the store for a short time. Both Joya and Joya are now reportedly back at home. This is not the first time that a man has been filmed with his bare hands using a paw-senger."

She met Ella Muteerji, 22, at a fundraising event earlier this month and is now training to help other people after being diagnosed with inoperable paralysis.

I went to a gym and I felt really good. I looked a bit tired so I went to a friend's place and used a walker to get me out of the gym. I didn't really have much feeling in my hands but I really enjoyed it and I'm back training and it is great to see how far I'm going. Ella, from the city's South Shore, was told she had a rare degenerative form of spinal cord disease. It affects the cerebellum. I was at the beach on the day of the event and I had the impression I was about to get hit by a wave. I had to get up and I couldn't walk. I tried to walk but couldn't because of the pain in my neck. I was worried I might die from it at first, but I was determined to get better and go back to university. It was a massive relief because I have no feeling in my hands so I couldn't do anything with my legs. Mrs Muteerji added:"" I have been training and have been on medication for three years.

The woman, who is in her 40s, is believed to have been raped before she was raped by a fellow patient and then left unattended in the hospital. A doctor in the nursing home said: ""I do not know if the killer was able to access the place because he was at home elsewhere. It could take up to a week for the authorities to confirm that.

145,"Caregiver convicted of rape in nursing home 27 (UPI) -- A California woman whose dementia-stricken husband committed suicide has been convicted of attempted rape and kidnapping, prosecutors said. Prosecutors Monday said that Nancy Mersane, 67, a married mother of three, had hoped to marry a man whom she did not want to have to deal with, the Los Angeles Times reported. A jury found Mersane guilty of attempted rape and kidnapping, and one count each of rape, sexual assault and sodomy. In exchange for the guilty verdicts, she was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Mersane, who is living in Los Angeles, had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and had difficulty communicating with her husband, Stephen, who said he had been in a vegetative state for years. Mersane, who once was a special education teacher, was diagnosed with dementia in 2006 and had been unable to get a job in the nursing home industry. She and her husband had been married for 14 years. Two other women, also suffering from Alzheimer's, testified against Mersane. They testified at trial that she had a fascination with men and was sexually violent toward her husband. Mersane's lawyer, Anthony Bertagna, described the verdict as an ""outrageous"" abuse of the court system. ""She was married to Stephen for nearly 40 years, and she has always been a very loving and caring woman who cared for him and her children,"" Bertagna said. She can only hope that ultimately the jury will be swayed by that. It should be an outrageous verdict. Mersane has been in prison since her 1996 conviction on attempted rape charges. The Times said Mersane, a teacher for 23 years, is expected to begin serving her sentence on Thursday. She could have been eligible for parole earlier. Mersane was married to then-husband Daniel Mersane for 30 years before he committed suicide in 2000. After Mersane's death, one of her two surviving daughters said her mother had become depressed and did not understand what was happening to her. Prosecutors said Mersane, who had long been married to Stephen and had two children, believed Stephen had been planning to kill her, the Times reported. She was accused of repeatedly telling Stephen Mersane, 48, who was not a relative, that she had not slept for days. She has also been accused of threatening to kill Mersane"
146,"How artificial intelligence and robots can change your living spaces For centuries, we've had the belief that life would be the same as it is now, but that doesn't mean we should stop living and working in cities. It's only natural that we should live in cities because this would have a profound impact on the way we think. In the age of artificial intelligence, we should take every opportunity to learn from the past and explore new ways of living. But what if we don't? Imagine that a robotic system would automatically see you live in your home, the same way a human can see you and so on, and you're always going to need your own washing machine. This is, one of the major limitations of the current technology. There are no hard and fast rules, and many of these would be quite different depending on how you choose to live your life. What you'd really want to see is for every robot to be able to learn, for certain robots to be able to learn, and autonomous machines to learn. But we can't expect robots to learn any more than humans. We need to develop a range of technologies that enable robots to learn, and learn from each other. As this is happening, the possibility of robots in cities is exciting, but more needs to be done. As the technology develops, the potential for a robot to learn and be useful becomes ever more obvious. So, as we move into the 21st century, we need to consider how we can best learn from each other, and how best we can use each other's skills to develop the skills that we need for the future.

147,"Deciphering the hidden meanings of Japanese tattoos There's no doubt that Japanese people love tattoos. But tattoos are notoriously difficult to decipher. And now, some have revealed strange and rather amusing details of their hairstyles and even life experiences. Some tattoos are more confusing than others. For example, some tattoos on people's hands are not always obvious but reveal a lot about their life. In other cases tattoo-lovers can spot hidden meanings - such as the 'yin' on your elbow and the 'yin' on your back. The more confusing a ink look, the more potential for an inked tattoo to be included. Meanwhile, another tattoo artist has revealed a tattoo that people often forget is their own face. While some people with lop-sided skin may think they're in fact tattoos, it's actually a phoenix tattoo that is actually a long-lost relative. While it may seem like a mythical creature, the artist known in Japan as' Jiro ', who goes by the name of Jiro, says the tattoo is actually the result of an accident.'My old tattoo is tattooed to resemble the flame retardant plant,' he told the Guardian. After an accident, I covered it right up with a red rose. I was given some kind of plant to resemble the natural retardant plant. So it resembles the little phoenix. But Jiro, who tattoos his hands with tiny symbols, said that he decided to have the phoenix etched onto his body after it happened.'One day I was driving and this strange chime came on the radio and it had this stench in my car, 'he said. My body was floating in water and I thought, ""this is how it feels to be reborn."" So I covered it with a red rose and it was this strange chime that stuck out to me when I was driving. The chime was so small that I couldn't even detect it.' Jiro explained that he got the idea for the tattoo after visiting a tattoo parlour in Tokyo.'I was like, ""Oh my God, are you serious?"" 'he said. The following day I went to a tattoo parlor in Nagoya. There I was told that Jiro had a phoenix tattoo on his body."

Shortly after being diagnosed with brain cancer, 17-year-old Ben was put on a ventilator to avoid the chance of death. He says this video has ""led to the end of his suffering."" Ben was diagnosed with brain cancer in August 2013. He was told he might die, but his family decided not to believe his story until he was able to hear the story. ""I was told he was dying,"" said Ben's mother, Ruth Naden, at the hospital where the video was filmed. It was a very, very strange experience. I felt quite helpless. The video had been uploaded to his YouTube page. Ben's dad is in the video, taking a break from watching the meditation. I'm going to tell him this too, he's got a little Buddhist thing about him, about praying and learning. When I was diagnosed with cancer, I was really sick and my head was all over the place... I just thought I could turn it on and take it all in. And it did. Ben says the video has helped him take matters in his own hands. ""It's helped me take things in my own hands, which has helped me feel happier about myself and feel more positive about my life,"" he said. I'm just happy that I get to see that stuff. This is not like a life lesson or a diagnosis. It's just something you have to go through. Ben's oncologist described his cancer as extremely aggressive and has set an aggressive target to cure for his condition within three years. Doctors say Ben's story has shown doctors that the illness, which has only got worse in the last six months, can be cured. ""This was Ben's chance to live a normal life,"" said Naden. His life's been saved for him. So he deserves to live a normal life. Ben's story has been featured on Facebook, YouTube and other social media. ""It's meant that he's not looking back,"" said his father. He's just learning to communicate. He's got the right stuff now. There's a lot of stuff there to be done for him to live a normal life. So, I'm really pleased with that."

Carpenter Jr., in which bone from their shared ovary was replaced and implanted in the neck, uterus and pelvis. The twins, born Jan. 7, were joined at the hip and abdomen. They shared an intestinal wall and nearly fully developed intestines. The boys were rushed to the hospital, where surgeons removed their ""shared intestines,"" which were separated and implanted in each other's bodies. The surgery was complex and at times painful. ""They also suffered injuries to their internal organs and spine,"" the hospital said in a statement. All three are expected to survive.

151,"The guru's gift: Staying calm in a world of chaos and confusion. The first time I heard this was from the rooftops at around 7 in the morning. In the same way, those who are working at the ""right"" or ""wrong"" end of the space race, that was my first thought when I saw this new space race from beyond the streets. But it's hard to tell anymore with this new view, because we are waiting for it to move. They say it looks like a satellite and that's wrong. But it's not. The space race started in the 1950s, with a NASA radio orbiting around the Earth during the 1950s. The second world war began in the mid-1960s. It was launched in 1957. It would take a decade or more for the first lunar module to make it into orbit. It wasn't until the 1980s that the space race became fully fledged. A U.S. launch in 1976 was expected to put the International Space Station on a path to the moon in about a decade, then restart in 2005. But in 2012 the space agency decided to scrap a space shuttle flight that had been scheduled for next year to test the system's steering system. The replacement program was scuttled in January while NASA examined the impact of the failed test. The space force shrank to just two active shuttles in the late 1970s, and today the agency has dozens of unmanned planes that are capable of carrying humans in space. Musk said he's inspired by what he calls the ""race to the moon,"" in light of an example he's seen in the past few years.

Ferne then enjoyed a glass of wine and a pizza with her friends, with the trio all being given different plates to try and enjoy. She also revealed that she always dresses in her bump and has a tattoo of a black heart on her arms, but will never get an implant. Ferne had an implant fitted in November 2012, which she had done to ease her pain during her previous pregnancies. While the implants were removed, her stomach went into hibernation and she developed contractions while pregnant. Ferne told OK! Magazine: 'I was happy, but I was a bit taken aback as it was such a traumatic time. I don't think I'll ever want to get pregnant again. I'm not desperate to get pregnant again - I've got enough on my plate.' Ferne has also discussed her battle with body image, during a recent interview with The Sun. She told the publication: 'There was always a focus on my figure and I didn't want to lose that. I knew I wanted to make the most of my figure, but not lose that 10-stone. She added:' I had gone out and done all this work and I wanted to show off my body, and so I really couldn't go back to my normal self.

153,"Stopping the opioid crisis in the womb is a priority for the Trump administration but its funding for treatment has been slashed. President Donald Trump has proposed slashing the US budget for treatment of opioid addiction by $600 million over 10 years, including a reduction in funding for the program that helps addicts access treatment. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in September to cut funding for the treatment program, which helped about 260,000 people get treatment last year. Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais The US has not had an opioid crisis since the 1970s, when a surge of abuse and overdose killed more than 50,000 people. The crisis has prompted a federal investigation into the crisis. In a statement, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the drug overdose death rate in 2016 was a record high. In a recent report, the CDC said that the country was ""in the midst of a heroin epidemic."" It said that heroin use and abuse were closely tied to health problems including arthritis, heart disease, and depression. The rate of overdose deaths among all age groups increased between 1995 and 2016, the report said, while the number of deaths from drug overdoses jumped by nearly one-third. The CDC also said that the rate of overdose deaths among people aged 20 to 24 increased from about half in 1995 to more than one-third in 2016. The agency said that the increase is due in part to more people opting to seek treatment for heroin addiction, especially since the availability of some prescription drugs has improved. The increase in overdose deaths is especially concerning as more than 20% of Americans ages 18 to 29 have attempted to take illicit drugs, the agency said. ""This is shocking and unacceptable,"" said Marisol Thomas, acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We need to stop the flow of opioid treatment and we need to make sure that this toll of opioid addiction is prevented before it is too late. The report is based on data collected in the year ending in June 2016. The White House has suggested that a proposal to cut funding for treatment will be included in the president's forthcoming ""budget strategy,"" which will be released on September 13, following a vote in the Senate. Trump has already proposed steep cuts to the drug epidemic. This article first appeared on the New York Post and was republished with permission."
154,"Where Trump support and Obamacare use soar President Trump's approval rating, while still slipping, soared in the first month of his presidency. That's according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. The poll found that 37% of Americans approved of the job the president is doing, and that Trump's job approval was up from 43% that week, while his overall job approval rating was down from 39%. Still, the public approved of Trump's handling of the economy and his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord, according to the poll. The president's approval rating of 21% was the highest the Post-ABC poll has surveyed since early April, at the same time the polling company has seen a steady decline in Trump's approval numbers. Trump's approval rating in the first month of his presidency rose sharply, to 44%, from 38% the last time the poll was asked. The poll also found that the percentage of Americans who disapproved of Trump's job performance has jumped significantly in the first month of his presidency, from 58% in July to 78% this week. The numbers, though, aren't what a CNN poll had predicted. In September, the poll found that 24% of Americans disapproved of the job Trump is doing, while 37% approved. The CNN poll also revealed that Trump's approval rating was down from 65% in July to 62% now, but he still remains the lead among GOP voters. The poll surveyed 412 registered voters Nov. 1-9 with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The Times' poll surveyed 707 voters nationwide from Nov. 3-9 and had a margin of error of 2.4 percentage points. The poll was conducted Oct. 30-Nov. It surveyed 1,503 registered voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The poll surveyed 609 likely voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The poll surveyed 944 registered voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

156,"Understanding why a visa can be so coveted and reviled should not be difficult, but the UK Border Agency's failure to properly assess the value of the visa, or the need for it, has been incredibly frustrating to see. The review is expected to cost £20m. Last week, MPs issued a report that warned that the Government was failing to meet the target that it would cut visa fraud to zero. It said that immigration officials were wasting time and resources trying to assess and assess applicants """" risks. ""The Government has already come under criticism for the number of applicants denied a visa, which rose by 20 per cent at its peak last year. At the same time, it has also attracted criticism for the number of visas granted to so-called"" low risk ""migrants and asylum seekers despite the Home Office claiming that the country's net immigration is"" not unreasonable. ""A Home Office spokesman said:"" We have made significant progress in cutting fraud, but our own analysis shows the total number of visas granted to overseas visitors has fallen in real terms since 2010 to less than 1.7m in 2010. There are now over a million more work visas granted by the Home Office than at the peak of the economic downturn in 2009, whilst the number of overseas visitors has fallen from more than 700,000 in 2010 to about 700,000 in 2011. While the review is still being carried out, we have also set out ambitious targets for reducing the number of visas granted to both overseas and non-EU nationals. Last year our overall immigration target rose to reduce net migration to the minimum we could reasonably expect to bring in a year. That work is well under way and we are confident that we will be able to get it down to only 78,000 by the end of this parliament. This news comes ahead of the Government's next immigration review in April. The review will look at whether the Government is serious about tackling the issue of ""weak"" criminals. Last week, it also emerged that it had stopped issuing visas to foreign nationals after admitting that it could not verify their immigration status. Currently, around 3,500 foreigners granted visas are granted each year but the Government has said it is ""considering"" limiting the number to the current 1,600 over the next five years. Last month, the Home Office said that it had stopped issuing the more than 168,000 visas each year. An official report into the visas was published in February."
157,"From Gandhi to guns: An Indian woman at the NRA convention A young woman walks into the NRA convention with a gun during a speech in Nashville, Tennessee on Saturday. Photograph: Robert W Harding / AP Some of the fiercest gun control talk in recent memory has been sparked by the shooting in Parkland, Florida, last week. However, one woman in the US has taken the initiative to highlight exactly why: she is a woman. The young woman was attending the NRA convention in Nashville, Tennessee, when she met one of the organisers. ""It was time for me to tell them that I'm a woman, and that I want to be a part of the solution,"" she told ABC News. In all of her 22 years of activism, she has never met a gun-control group, she added, but she told ABC she hopes they will encourage change in communities. ""I think we can make change if we don't let gun violence define us or define us,"" she said. She has been shot in the arm but decided to talk to her local paper to expose the ""blatant lie"" that guns are a ""badge of honour,"" and she has told the publication that she shares the NRA's values. ""We don't want to be a gun-toting nation,"" she said, ""but we have to do something about it."" This reporter travelled to Nashville as part of a team of journalists.

The show will air on CBS' ""CSI"" a decade after its original run and stars the original cast members, Kristin Chenoweth, Sherri Shepherd, Michael Richards and Nicole Eggert. As CBS News' Chip Reid reports, ""Baby Noorgles"" will be a spinoff of the hit NBC show that premiered in May 2006. It's set in New York City. The show is the brainchild of ""CSI"" executive producer Jason Katims. The show is based on the book ""All the President's Men: The Insider Guide to the Most Personal Secrets of the Presidency"" by Christopher Steele, whose book ""Get Carter"" was cited as one of the Secret Service's top secrets. ""There is a lot of research going on to see if there are any secrets we don't really want to hear,"" Katims said. And it was a huge honor to be able to bring the cast together and bring it back to life. ""The Secret Service is my family, and so I think it's important to bring that back to life,"" Chenoweth added. The show began in Chicago in 2007 and was followed by an hour-long spin-off series called ""America's Next Top Secret Service"" in 2010. Katims said of ""Baby Noorgons"": ""They really do have a great story. They are just so smart. So good at what they do and so good at what they do. And the thing that I love about 'Baby Noorgles' is that they both fit into a much bigger family. The show also stars"" CSI ""alum Michael Richards and"" CSI ""alum Melissa Fumero.

I really love the people involved, but I think it's just as important to have fun and fun as the show. So I think it's great for the show.

160,"Halted MH370 search is not an end for one man The search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 did not turn up anything to suggest the plane was deliberately diverted, the country's transport minister said on Saturday, casting doubt on any conclusions reached by a new analysis. ""I think there's nothing in the final report that supports the conclusion that the aircraft was deliberately diverted,"" Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said on Saturday, making the comments on Malaysia's national television. Liow provided no details on the conclusions reached by the Boeing 777-200 that it had not entered the water in the Indian Ocean or Indian Ocean as previously stated during the initial phase of the search. He added that the plane had been found a few hours after it had gone missing. ""Not once has it gone down,"" Liow said, adding that only the plane was found near the Malaysian island of Sentosa. Liow said the plane had been found on a beach in the same area where the flight originated and searches had been conducted for about an hour before it was found. ""The search was suspended because of bad weather,"" he said. Liow said the search was continuing despite the discovery of two objects that could have been debris from the 239 passengers and crew on board. Four passengers who were confirmed as being crew members of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 have expressed anger at the announcement that the plane was deliberately diverted and their families fear for their safety. The Boeing 777 disappeared on March 8 while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The plane was due to arrive in Kuala Lumpur for Beijing at 7: 15 pm (1615 GMT) on March 8 but was diverted to Sentosa after the plane was expected to land at 5: 00 am. The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 plane transits at the Kuala Lumpur airport in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on March 8, 2014. Liow said the search for MH370 had been suspended because of the discovery of two objects that could have been debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight. ""The search for the flight is going on,"" Liow said, adding that Malaysia planned to reopen the search for the missing aircraft today. This is an ongoing process and we are not prepared to give up. It is not unusual after an incident like this that we will bring back the aircraft, ""he said."
161,"How ordinary people become 'white supremacists by default' LONDON -- Exactly a year after the shooting of one of the nation's youngest police officers, it's still being investigated. ""We have never been so afraid of the police,"" says the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who says it's thanks to the courage of the community that the national outrage over the death of Keith Lamont Scott has spurred a national conversation about police bias. The shooting of Scott on August 12 sparked protests across the country and sparked a national debate over police treatment of African Americans. Authorities say Scott opened fire because he was reaching for his gun, not because he was acting in self-defense. But police say they do not believe he was, and say he was carrying a knife. The Justice Department has opened an investigation into how a police department responded to Scott's death. His family says they will press for the same changes. The government also faces a lawsuit filed by Scott's family. ""You have a police force that treats black people as second-class citizens,"" says New York City resident and activist Marcia Clark. They treat them like disposable ninjas. The American Civil Liberties Union says the Justice Department's investigation is an issue that needs to be addressed. ""The federal government should get serious about investing in public trust that the police, and the FBI and other law enforcement agencies are doing their job properly,"" according to the ACLU. The ACLU is calling for the police to review their training and supervision of local police. The FBI has said it is investigating the shooting. ""While it is important that the investigation is done, we understand what happened,"" FBI Director James Comey said in a statement. We take seriously our responsibility to protect the safety of the American people. We will work to ensure that the facts are brought to our attention. The shooting comes as the American black community continues to fight to have police departments better trained and more equipped. We have seen a rise in incidents where police have to respond to an emergency situation. This is happening more and more because police are not capable of responding to a situation in broad daylight, ""says law enforcement and other community leaders.

The civil rights leader who called himself an ""African-American patriot"" is calling for more protests. The self-described ""King of the Country"" is challenging the racial makeup of the Democratic-led Congress and the White House. The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials is calling for a ""Day Without a Woman"" and a ""Day Without a Woman"" that day. AP Photo / Chris O'Meara In his first speech as NAACP president, Cornell William Brooks Jr. has called for more activism, writing in a Washington Post op-ed piece that ""the white people of this country have already lost the first four years of their lives because of the way our government has dealt with them."" While he acknowledges that ""there are racial aspects to them that are troubling,"" Brooks argues that ""the only way to change that is to get on the political right and get involved."" ""I'm not a racist, but I do recognize that some of our communities are troubled by the way that some of our government has dealt with some of our African-American communities and I think that it is very important that we all realize that,"" he writes. The NAACP has come under fire over its leadership of the historically conservative activists. The Southern Poverty Law Center published a study in June that found that the organization has been accused of ""systematically and systematically suppressing"" the voices of the black community, particularly indigenous black women, African-Americans and Hispanic women. The study described the organization as ""a segregated organization that treats blacks and Latinos as second-class citizens"" and said that ""the NAACP has acted as an exemplar of discrimination and intolerance."" It said that the organization was ""institutionally and legally racist,"" and that ""over the last two decades, it has imposed a system of institutional racism for blacks and Latinos that has resulted in economic inequality among its members."" The NAACP movement has been accused of ""institutional racism"" for its treatment of black voters, CNN reported."

165,"'Folks don't feel safe' The NHS, doctors and other health professionals should be allowed to judge the ethics of ""professional"" doctors, says a cross-party group of MPs. The Commons Public Accounts Committee says the current system is broken and patients are having to wait longer for treatment. It also says doctors should be given more responsibility for evaluating patients before giving advice. The MPs, from Newcastle upon Tyne, argue that the current system is not fit for purpose. They say that the NHS has not been working in proper patient-centred interests. In a submission to the committee, NHS England says that it is committed to ensuring its clinical staff are fairly represented in assessing clinical decisions. It says the responsibility for assessing decisions rests with the NHS. The committee says that ""new training,"" which allows doctors to review patients themselves, is needed to improve the quality of care. It also says that the NHS should be ""fully empowered"" to decide whether or not to give advice. ""We are concerned that this is not currently being carried out effectively,"" it says. Even if doctors were to have the information needed to make informed decisions about treatment, such actions would be incompatible with their duties to the public, it says. The MPs want a new service for doctors who specialise in mental health. Currently, a third of doctors do not have a specialist clinical role either. The committee is calling on the government to make sure that health professionals are equipped with the skills and experience to assist with diagnosing patients in a timely fashion. It also calls for more training for all NHS doctors and doctors to ensure that patients are ""assessed by professionals, not by clinical judgments."" But the MPs say that there is not enough support for all doctors to be able to offer this. They say that doctors should have more knowledge of the medical world and ""the context in which they operate, and the ethics of this."" It also wants to protect the NHS from being used as a ""back door"" to private companies, which would make it more difficult to understand why people are being treated in the NHS. Medical director Professor Ian Olver said: ""This important report highlights the importance of the NHS for patients to receive treatment in whatever way they can. It also highlights that what is needed in the NHS is better patient education and training, ensuring doctors are confident and have the confidence to recognise the unique role they have to perform in care."
166,"The other gun lobby groups for gun control - like Everytown for Gun Safety - are still willing to take on the National Rifle Association. The NRA has since abandoned that argument, moving to call for stronger background checks on all gun sales. Many gun owners are also suspicious of the NRA. On Monday, a gunman fired into a crowd of students celebrating the final prom attending Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people, including 20 children. A few weeks later, a man opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, killing 17 people, including 20 children. It has been noted that the NRA is also unusually active on social media. In November, the NRA called for banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic rifles to fire rapidly and have been used in all kinds of mass shootings. The organization previously opposed the Brady Bill, which would have banned the sport, and it had a similar bill passed after the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy. A bill introduced by Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut last month would have made it illegal for the National Rifle Association to sell it to anyone, unless it was deemed to be ""a threat to the free exercise of free speech."" But the Brady Bill passed the Senate in a vote of 58-41. Two weeks ago, Congress passed the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Since then, the NRA has been pushing to restrict access to many guns. The NRA has also been moving to fight on gun control measures. The group has been fighting in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Missouri. The new legislation is the second of its kind that was introduced by the NRA. In June it called for repealing the assault weapons ban. The bill, which was opposed by the gun rights group, the National Rifle Association, the National Shooting Sports Foundation and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, passed the Senate in a vote of 53-39. It's not clear whether the Brady Bill will become law. But it's worth noting that the NRA has faced criticism in the past from gun-rights groups. As The Washington Post reported last month, some gun control groups have been critical of the NRA's position on gun control, and called for stricter gun laws in other states. The gun control group, meanwhile, has struggled to get gun legislation through Congress."

168,"Amazon natives hold on to tradition after being forced to leave home by police for being too loud in the night A teenager has apologised after a group of Amazon natives were forced to leave their home in London before they were driven off in a police van to another location for being too loud. The group were taken to a house in central London for several hours after being pulled over by police. They were filmed being given a caution and driven away in a police van, while officers told them to ""put something on your tongue to shut up."" They were also told to ""do as you please"" before being led to the back of a police vehicle. The group were finally escorted to a location where they were told to do as they please, but were eventually driven away in a police van. ""I know the police are just as busy as us but we just wanted to get home,"" the group said in a Facebook post. They were also filmed making a quick call saying ""we're not being frightened."" The police said the group had been in the area ""regularly"" and wanted to get home to their families. They had been heard speaking to police on the phone, or passing information on to members of the public. A police spokesman said: ""We attended following a report of loud music coming from a house in Westminster. The Metropolitan Police Service was contacted by a member of the public who had been worried about a group of people drinking and overheard a group of police officers talking on the phone. As officers spoke with the group, they were approached by two men, one of whom left the group. They were stopped on the side of the road and driven away in the police van. As a result of this information the men were taken to a location. The police, who referred themselves to a police station, searched the area and there was nothing discovered. The group is now in the police van. The matter is now subject to an investigation by the MPS Directorate of Professional Standards. A police spokeswoman said:"" Our decision to make this group of Amazon natives leave the country was based on the advice of their local police team. They have been found to be in possession of a very small amount of drugs and we need to find out who the drugs are and, crucially, what they are doing with them. We will keep you updated on this investigation. Inspector Chris Moran, of the MPS, said: ""We would like to thank them all for their cooperation."
169,"Show animals and their proud handlers, she said, ""should not feel the need to be judged on these kinds of things."" The government has already begun to respond. On September 4th it announced the creation of an animal rescue centre in Beijing, with plans for a similar centre in Changsha, in the south-west of the country, in the coming months. The centre would have around 100 staff, and would take in rescued animals, said Mr Liu. But the first sign that the government is up to the task of rescuing animals is that of the country's most famous bear. Some state media are reporting that four-month-old Zong Zongzhen, who escaped from the centre, has been found. The owner of the bear that escaped, Henan County People's Court, has been charged with abuse of animals. The authorities are also reportedly on the case, says the BBC's Cindy Sui in Beijing. But the most likely outcome seems not only to be a new generation of pet bears, but possibly even a bear. That will probably be some time next year. In the meantime, China's zoo keepers have to show their guard. If animal abuse is not to be tolerated, then perhaps a second-class diploma would be given to those who are so poor that they are unable to feed their animals. That would surely be a fitting tribute to an animal whose survival is now an international issue. And it would also be a fitting tribute to those who have dedicated their lives to caring for their animals.

170,"Nineteen years under the rainbow: David Cameron pays tribute to Prince at PM's side 15 years since his passing, but in a fitting tribute to the late Duke of Edinburgh, David Cameron has made a rare public appearance at Prime Minister's Questions. As part of celebrations marking the passing of the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prime Minister also paid tribute to Prince Philip, who has been in hospital for the last five days. Following his death, Prince Philip stood down from public duties and took a more active role in the running of the royal household, which has been his main job since he began. Prince Philip will be buried at Westminster Abbey in a private ceremony on Monday.

""He was a great man indeed, and a great man in general,"" added the Prime Minister. At the end of the day, he was Prince Philip - and I know his family will miss him tremendously. The Queen has been the subject of growing speculation after she was photographed in a public park with Prince Philip at Sandringham in December, appearing in high spirits despite her age. A report by The Sun said Prince Philip had spent Monday night at Sandringham, walking with the Queen. On Tuesday, the Duke of Edinburgh, who will turn 90 next month, was also taken to the hospital by doctors for a chest infection. The Queen officially informed the Duke of Edinburgh of her decision to retire in the wake of his illness on Wednesday last week. She had been due to carry out a Diamond Jubilee tour on Thursday, but after the decision was taken, the Queen was readmitted to hospital. The monarch had been due to attend a state dinner in Downing Street to mark the tenth anniversary of the Cenotaph, but came down with a bad cold. The Queen is said to be desperate to mark the occasion, with much of the nation expected to be enjoying the festivities. The Queen began proceedings with a traditional salute, followed by a rendition of All the Things That I Am."

172,"Girls behind bars tell their stories from behind bars One of the seven alleged gang members. HOW they got away is one of the biggest mysteries that has emerged in the case of the three sisters who confessed to burning a book at Caltex as they were released on bail. Five-year-old Amelia Jackson, Jackson's sister, was locked up alongside three other women in the Barwon prison, accused of igniting an enormous bush fire and an attack on a fellow inmate. A week after the escape, the girls pleaded guilty to arson and assault offences against prison staff. The other four girls were jailed for 11 and 12 years respectively. Close friend Madison Mee said the girls made the decision to run away from the boys as they got into a fight with staff. ""They (the girls) thought they were going to get away from them,"" Ms Mee said. They were talking to each other, the staff were talking to them. She said the girls ""were shouting,"" Run, don't run. """" She said one of the girls ""ran downstairs to the kitchen and started screaming and running."" When she ran out of the kitchen, she went straight to the kitchen and started to smash a book in the ground, ""Ms Mee said. She said one of the girls said she had been given a cell phone."" She was so upset, she started crying, ""Ms Mee said. Ms Mee said she saw the girls in a"" very agitated ""state and was"" angry ""when the girls ran away."" The fire brigade were there within three seconds, ""Ms Mee said. Ms Mee said the girls left the Barwon women's prison after being remanded in custody until October 3. Ms Mee said one of the girls was"" very upset about it. """" She didn't know what to do, ""Ms Mee said. She was very upset. The Barwon women's prison is located in the Barwon area of Melbourne. Two female officers were injured, one seriously, when they battled the blaze. One of the girls is still in hospital in a serious but stable condition.

173,"Up close in the brutal world of a female fight club I was involved in a very physical fight a few years ago with a female MMA fighter who was very, very brutal towards her. It didn't end well and it seems it was an outcome she intended to cause. I am happy to say a final apology was issued in defence of the video, not least because it shows what can happen when a woman is in a place of control. That woman was one of two female MMA fighters that I have spoken to since that incident. Those two female fans that behave in such a brutal manner are motivated purely by the desire to finish the sport with another woman. That is why the sport has changed and will change. Those fans who behave in such a violent manner in MMA need to realise that it is unacceptable to put yourself, others, and the sport of MMA in peril. That is why the sport of MMA has changed. You can't blame the woman for being angry. It's only affecting her. It has had an effect on her career, even though she is a woman. She is a woman who is incredibly determined to finish what she started, and who is very harsh on herself for that. But she also knows that the wider public will, as a result of what happened, support her hugely. When she won the title, she couldn't take it back. Once she is done with boxing, she will go back and try to take it back again. And that is sad. If anything, this incident highlights once again that the sport is serious about the safety of its participants. My father was a big boxing fan and he loved the way that MMA was played. It is not clear whether a ban on boxing will be implemented in New Jersey, although it is known that the state's attorney general has asked the UFC to supply footage of the incident. My dad is a big boxing fan and this incident has put a bit of a dent in that. It is not the UFC's fault, Ultimate Fighting doesn't need the state attorney general to intervene. Many people will disagree but if someone has had a boxing match or a fight, they should take responsibility for that. It wasn't that hard to do. It may seem like it's just not fair but it is the UFC's fault. They should take responsibility and protect the fighters. That is a huge problem. They are responsible. They should act like adults. They are responsible."

This is a horrible way to treat refugees, and they need to be treated with dignity, ""said Renate Künast, the organisation's president."" These people have been very badly treated for years by the authorities in Khartoum, ""she added. The refugees come from Syria, Libya, Afghanistan and Pakistan. They have been living in the camps for years, and have been living in horrendous conditions in conditions which don't allow them to earn a living, such as with little food and little water. The refugees have been given food, water and medical care in the camps, and are entitled to more and better shelter, healthcare and housing until they are allowed to return to their countries of origin. Thousands more have fled across the border into Germany since the beginning of the year, according to the UN. But the numbers left are dire. As of Sunday, it was estimated that more than 400,000 people had disappeared from their homes in the six months to September. The UN High Commission for Refugees has warned that the influx of refugees in recent months has caused a"" humanitarian crisis.

Rosenstein became the acting attorney general last week after the resignation of James Comey, the former FBI director who earlier this year was criticized for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. CNN confirmed Rosenstein had sent the President-elect a letter calling Comey's firing ""the most bizarre, outrageous decision"" he had ever made. CNN's Jim Acosta on Tuesday reported that Rosenstein told Trump that Comey was ""not doing a good job"" in the Russia investigation. Rosenstein said Comey should have been more forthcoming about the investigation into Russian interference in the election. I think it's the most bizarre, outrageous and unbelievable decision and it's just appalling. It's the ultimate abuse of power, ""Rosenstein told Acosta. Trump, in a CNN interview in November, called Comey an"" honest man ""who"" set the standards, ""adding that he would"" love ""to have him back on the job.

177,"Schools knew of trouble before student deaths in Ohio: inspector-general HARRISBURG (Reuters) - Schools and local authorities knew of problems before students at two Ohio high schools went missing in November, a state inspector-general said on Wednesday. The report was released as Ohio legislators and prosecutors looked into the deaths of 11-year-old Zachary Patrick and 15-year-old Abigail Williams at Toledo High School from a combination of drug overdoses. ""Schools have known for many months that they needed to do more to protect our students, and the Ohio Department of Education has acted,"" state Representative John Swenson said at a news conference. ""There is no systemic failure at any school, and I want to thank the school board, teachers and parents who have stepped up to the plate for this important step forward for our students,"" he said. Zachary Patrick and Abigail Williams were found dead in December in a Toledo apartment. Investigators have theorized Zachary Patrick took heroin, possibly by mistake. The girls jumped to their deaths from a third-floor window of a building to escape after an alleged sexual assault, according to the state medical examiner's office. A coroner has ruled that the girls' deaths were homicides by hanging. The Ohio Department of Administration and Education said the school system was cooperating with the investigation. ""Due to the investigation in the case, it would not be appropriate to provide further details,"" a message to students said. Earlier on Wednesday, the head of the Ohio high school district that owns the high school where Zachary Patrick and Abigail Williams were found dead said the district did not have a policy or procedure governing the handling of the death of students. ""We had a policy and procedure and we never had a policy and procedure of what it was,"" said Richard Smith, director of the district's office of student safety and mental health. The district has no policies or protocol that the district followed that resulted in a death.

178,"The real story behind those Planned Parenthood videos -- latimes.com Washington - The federal government has put a new face on abortion, saying it is spending money to perform abortions that are not legal in most cases in cases of rape or incest. But there are more pressing issues to address - at least, not as big as the Planned Parenthood videos that have emerged this week. They show a woman in a fetal position -- with the help of an aide -- getting a tube inserted inside her body. A doctor then proceeds to perform an abortion, under the supervision of a female nurse who was in the room. the woman has not had the procedure since the procedure began. The woman, who is not identified, does not have a history of sexually transmitted diseases. What's striking about the video shows that the woman was not the only woman or woman who had a baby. She was a single mother of two young children and employed as a clinic nurse. She asked to be identified only as JTW, after her last name. At least one other health care worker is identified in the video, but JTW did not provide a birth certificate. The video, first reported by The New York Times, focused solely on the two staff members involved. The aide and nurse were identified as Julie Schlachet, a nurse, and Jacqueline Stinson, a nurse. The nurse, who has trained for 20 years and has also worked at a hospital for 15, could not be reached for comment. In another video, the woman is seen giving birth in a hospital room, which is not what her birth certificate says. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a Times request for comment. In its response to the videos, HHS said it was spending $100 million on child health care services at the end of 2013, and that it is committed to improving the situation. On Wednesday, HHS said the department is also making significant changes to improve abortion services for women in the United States. The department announced a new policy for abortions over the next two years, which includes banning the use of drugs that are not available on the Internet, or at clinics. The agency also said it will no longer require women to provide consent to abortion, and will require clinics to make abortion-related complaints more easily available. The department also said it will begin requiring that hospitals that perform abortions disclose how many procedures"
179,"Sources: Disabled work program mired in fraud, abuse Federal officials have long suspected a nationwide program to better manage the federal disability insurance program is mired in fraud and abuse, according to people familiar with the matter. The allegations have been made in a Justice Department report that is being released Saturday to congressional investigators and is expected to describe what it calls an ""epidemic"" of abuse and fraud that is ""endemic"" in the program. The allegations stem from a government-run ""Disability Insurance Assistance Trust,"" or DSI, program, which helps disabled workers find jobs, buy homes and get health care. The payments are meant for people with disabilities. To be eligible for the payments, DSI workers must demonstrate to the program that they have worked for at least three years, have been eligible for the disability benefits and have a job. The fraud occurred between 2007 and 2010, according to the report. The report also says that thousands of disabled workers may have been improperly overpaid for the jobs they were given. The scheme is still under investigation. The number of employees was not released, but a Department of Labor investigation has found that some disabled workers were overpaid, possibly because their jobs did not meet required standards. The New York Times first reported the allegations Friday. The agency's inspector general and federal health inspector general are investigating a ""national survey"" of the disability insurance program, officials said. The survey was conducted in September and the results were released in November. The report was prepared by a team led by Tom Price, then acting secretary of Health and Human Services, and conducted by congressional investigators. Officials said the report found that more than 40 percent of people who identified as being disabled had not been paid by DSI. That was up from 28 percent in 2011. In reviewing the data, the inspector general found that the number of workers not receiving disability and other payments rose by as much as 25 percent, from more than 1,000 to more than 5,300. Several experts have told the Times that the abuse is widespread. In the report, investigators also questioned about 1,500 workers who received disability from the disability insurance program. The report said that the majority of payments had been made in the form of a ""substandard"" number of payments. They said that the amounts are not necessarily valid, and that they are likely to have been paid out in future months. ""More than $100 million has been wrongly paid,"" the report said. Staff writer Jennifer Jenkins contributed to this report."

UU has already fired four administrators since then. It said it is working with police authorities to investigate the allegations. The school said it is"" committed to working with law enforcement authorities to identify the truth surrounding the accusations. ""The university said it has not publicly identified any of the alleged recruits, but confirmed that four UU staff members have been suspended. The other suspended are UU associate athletic director for football operations Brett Sack, and athletic director for athletics Alysha Adams."

Airports in the UK are in the midst of a security crackdown which has seen passengers turned away from check-in desks because they were hidden in their checked luggage. The police and airline staff in Scotland have been deployed to take down the bags, which contain as little as one pound of luggage per person. The devices have since been seized by officials, who are now investigating the theft. Officers are also investigating the theft of two laptops, one camera and one mobile phone that were found hidden in the bags during a routine baggage check at London's Gatwick Airport. The laptops had been placed in the checked luggage of employees for the weekend's long weekend, using them to film and photograph them while they were out of the country. Police Scotland confirmed that staff had been deployed at the airport and that the bag had been recovered, following a full examination of the bag. A spokesman said: ""Around 20 items were found during a routine baggage check at London Gatwick Airport on Saturday, 5 December. A total of 21 bags were seized from the bag and the suspect has been arrested. The suspect is being held in custody at the airport and inquiries are ongoing to trace the suspect.

VA: 1 in 6 veterans wait more than a year for care Robert Wood Johnson: VA's' wasteful and incompetent 'programs have left injured men, women, young men dead ""There is a deep injustice and failure by the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide care to all veterans,"" said Rep. Thomas M. Davis (R-Va.). It's clear to me that the VA is wasting taxpayer dollars and we must hold them accountable. Davis was an outspoken critic of the Obama administration's handling of the scandal, and his comments Monday at a congressional hearing touched off an outcry from veterans advocates. Davis said he would not be intimidated by President Trump's aggressive tone in the wake of the report, but he said his views would ""certainly help lead this discussion."" The VA's latest report, released Monday, examined care for 65,000 veterans, including a random sample of veterans of the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Afghanistan. In his first year in the job, Davis said the agency will hire 10,000 more people, saving $2.2 billion. That's on top of the $3.8 billion the agency had added in costs since he took over last year. VA hopes to hire 60,000 veterans by the end of 2018. In addition, it expects to hire 110,000 new employees by the end of 2019. Davis said he has ""serious concerns"" about the department's performance. ""We know we can do better, I think we can do better,"" Davis said. He said he had not read the report and could not comment on it further. But he said that he is still concerned. ""I am concerned about the quality of care at the Veterans Affairs facilities and we need to do everything we can to make sure that we can provide the care that this nation deserves,"" he said.

The IRS has not been able to fully identify the scams that are causing the massive amounts of losses, the internal watchdog said. Related: How to save $10 billion without using a tax return The scams are being perpetrated by tax preparers, taxpayers and tax software providers who have created online tax planners who are then charging exorbitant fees to do so. The IRS told the inspector general for the Government Oversight and Government Reform that it is currently working to figure out how to limit the losses. The auditors general are now requiring the IRS to report every year on how it is managing the scams. The report said the IRS is requiring tax preparation software providers, which are not required to report losses, to publish names of those who file them with the IRS. They will also provide details of the tax preparers who provide their services. The IRS has become a focus of investigations into tax cases because of the growing number of cases. The watchdog's report reveals that the IRS is spending $45 million a year on scams that are costing taxpayers up to $142 million each year. The audit also found that the IRS has been focusing on other types of tax preparers who are using exorbitant fees to receive the money. The audit also found that the IRS is spending $1.2 million a year on tax preparers who are using exorbitant fees to receive money The budget for the IRS ""tax preparation program has increased by $12.4 million in the past two years to $1.1 billion. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the agency increased its budget for the program to $4.8 billion from $3.1 billion in fiscal 2016. Related: Instant Insight: Tax reform is real, and it's going to get complicated The IRS has also been slow in identifying what it is doing to stop tax preparers from breaking the law, the report said.

It's not the first time that lawmakers have found themselves at the center of a controversy. In 2007, Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) was caught on tape telling a female staffer to use the $35,000 phone she used to get the tax break. She later admitted that she was"" a little flip-flopper. ""President Obama's administration was accused of trying to push the House ethics committee into approving a $35,000 phone bill to lawmakers. The decision was later reversed. Similar scandals have occurred in the past. In December, six members of Congress were caught on videotape playing a video game in which their wives played a game that featured their husbands using the money to get themselves elected. They also reportedly gambled and used that money to buy a home, a condo and a fleet of luxury cars. The House ethics committee also has been the subject of numerous controversies. In December, House Republicans forced a vote on a $400 million earmark to help veterans and other spending priorities. Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) and Rep. Pat Tiberi (R-Ohio) were caught on videotape playing a game where their wives played the money to get themselves elected. The House ethics committee also is investigating Rep.

The scandal surrounding the IRS has also prompted the resignation of two former White House aides for alleged actions that were not disclosed in official policies.

188,"Alabama town mirrors US class divide on immigration law By Frank McGurty Tue Sep 26, 2014 8: 16pm EDT (Reuters) - Residents of a small Alabama town are more divided over President Barack Obama's immigration overhaul than the rest of the nation, according to a new poll released on Tuesday. A poll of 1,003 adults conducted by the Montgomery Post newspaper shows that 67 percent of residents think the immigration reform plan is a good idea while 44 percent disagree. That's up from 70 percent who disapprove of the plan and 41 percent who think it is a bad idea, the poll shows. However, most residents back the plan, with 75 percent saying it is a good idea. The poll results come amid the controversy over the Obama administration's executive action on immigration, which many Republicans have said was a mistake that was a major plank of the November 2012 election. Some Republicans have urged Obama to use the federal government's resources to focus on immigration when he is in charge. The poll found that 39 percent of residents believed the federal government should focus on the issue while 41 percent supported the state's plan, which would allow thousands of immigrants to successfully apply for legal status in the United States. Half of those surveyed said they were not sure who they wanted to see on the Supreme Court. Overall, 57 percent said they support illegal immigration and a similar number said the plan would not help them. A similar poll in July found that 44 percent of respondents in the Montgomery area said illegal immigrants should be deported. The poll found that 80 percent of voters in the city of about 40,000 people do not trust the federal government, while 72 percent favored allowing undocumented immigrants to live in the United States. The poll was conducted from June 15-19.

189,"The truth about the white working class In many ways, the British political establishment has been at the centre of the current crisis in the UK, and the same goes for the BBC. The collapse of the Tory government after the Brexit referendum has been a highly charged story in British politics, with the Conservatives under pressure from a large number of voters and the Labour party under pressure from other parties to make inroads into the middle classes and to fight off attempts to dilute their appeal. The question of Labour's leadership is as fraught and dangerous as it is divisive. One thing that has changed is the way in which the British establishment has reacted to the events of the past week. After the BBC's Newsnight report on the collapse of the Conservative government, the Tory party in Scotland has been seen to be unable to put a positive spin on the situation. The party's leader in Scotland, Ruth Davidson, has retreated from her commitment to the Union, but the SNP leadership has called for support for the party's leader at the Scottish Parliament, Angus Robertson. The SNP has also sought to distance itself from the story. The only thing that has changed is how the BBC has reacted to the events of the past week, and indeed the BBC's decision to run a story about the collapse of the Labour party. In a statement, the BBC said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the reports. Stephen Twigg, the Shadow Political Editor, said: ""I am concerned about this development and would strongly support the BBC's decision to run a story about a Scottish Labour leadership contest. It's a real tragedy that the BBC's journalism is failing to do that. Lord Patten, the BBC's Media Executive, said that it was not"" appropriate ""for the group's reporters to cover the crisis because it was a"" private matter. ""But he said it was"" not appropriate ""for the BBC to run stories about the situation at the BBC. The only people facing repercussions were the BBC staff who were told they would not face disciplinary action, and the broadcaster which had the right to run the story. None of the BBC journalists could be reached for comment. I have also asked the BBC to fully investigate what has happened at the BBC and then to give full and transparent explanations about the matter. The BBC has already announced that its director general, Tony Hall, has been forced to step down. After the Newsnight expose, the BBC released a statement saying it would co-operate fully"
190,"2016: Last call for working class whites? CNN's MJ Lee reported in North Carolina that the ""state of the nation"" is a key issue in the election - but not this time. The CNN / ORC poll also found that 46 percent of voters under age 30 said they would support a candidate who ""reaches out to working-class voters."" But that number dropped to 42 percent among those ages 18-34. ""You can't discount that, but we seem to be seeing a decline in working-class voters,"" Lee writes. The survey also found that one in three workers under 30 is still unemployed, compared to one in seven between the ages of 25 and 29. The unemployment rate for millennials is over 6 percent and the percentage of those 50 and older without a college education has fallen to its lowest point in a decade, according to a study released Thursday by the Pew Research Center. In addition to the state of the nation, how the election is being decided is a very important factor. Americans are mobilizing on issues that have a very big impact politically, ""Keenan said. The election is in the midst of its final stretch, with a new survey from the Pew Research Center showing Clinton facing a potentially awkward challenge from Sanders. In the Democratic race, Clinton leads Sanders 56 percent to 41 percent among black voters. The poll also has Sanders beating the Vermont senator 50 percent to 40 percent among white voters. The CNN / ORC poll found that as of Sunday evening, more than 7 in 10 Democrats and about 15 percent of Independents were supporting Clinton. The poll's margin of error is 2.9 percentage points. As of Sunday, 63.6 percent of Republican voters said they were certain they would vote for the Democratic party nominee, and 51.3 percent of Democrats said they were certain they would vote for Clinton. In Iowa, according to the Des Moines Register poll, Donald Trump is viewed positively by 55 percent of GOP voters, while Bernie Sanders loses support by 3 percentage points. More than half of Republican voters have a favorable view of Sanders, and the Clinton campaign campaign has also announced a new ad touting the senator's record."" We have worked with a dedicated and dedicated team of people to connect with millions of voters and run multiple ads that will help them connect with Senator Sanders, ""the Clinton campaign said in a statement."" The goal is not to disrupt Senator Sanders, ""it added."

Because the interview was on a Sunday morning. It's to a certain degree unsurprising to evangelicals and even some of his liberal supporters that O'Reilly's comments are being taken as an effort to make light of the ongoing scandal over sexual abuse at Fox News. I never heard him talk about the sexual abuse scandal. That was not his job. And I don't think it bears thinking about that. It's not his job, ""O'Reilly told Fox News host Sean Hannity.

192,"The shell-shocked white working class of the 1850s who lived the rural idyll of the Victorian period were then left to fend for themselves, as the housing market tanked with unaffordable rent, falling property values and unemployment. They were left to look for a better life - or try to escape the world and their social environment and the financial crisis which followed. The housing crisis, along with the collapse in the banking system, led to a huge rise in the number of homes being built. In the 1950s there were more than seven million homes built in Britain - but they were still just 330,000. Today the housing market is worth more than half a trillion pounds and is gradually overtaking the financial sector as the fastest growing part of the economy. But in England only one in ten homes are in decent condition and the average age of a tenant is just 22. There is no official definition of 'poor' in England, although a definitive ""good"" rating is given by the National Housing Federation (NHF). The problem is that many properties are built too quickly. The government set up a register of builders in 2012, but most of the information needed to get a good rating is not available online. The government says that the aim is to improve the quality of Britain's building. But some builders have argued that it would be better to have the right kind of construction firms. That is a point raised by a group of builders ""leaders last month. They said that in the past the government had created a"" big red herring, ""where councils were given powers to restrict development. Construction is not a good thing. It is not up to the Government to approve construction without good quality firms. We need to make our communities better places to live,"" said John Everitt of the Homes Unlimited group. There are almost 300 community-based builders in English county council areas. The vast majority are small companies, which have the support of local authorities. The government says these are not ""fit for purpose."" But the NHF says that it has shown it's willing to work with them. It says that by the time it has approved a housing plan, councils have already signed up to a national code of practice. The government says that a more modern ""sustainable"" home building model should be adopted from the 1970s. But some builders say that building is still a long way off.

193,"West Virginia's' forgotten tribe '; why the white working class feels left behind If you've ever wondered what a mysterious and outspoken white tribe is, you might finally have an answer. To answer a question right now posed by an angry voter, author Paul Root is to reveal why America's ""forgotten tribe"" feels so disenfranchised. Root, an expert on the nation's tribal heritage, suggests the group could have a ""personal problem."" ""Having been raised in a tribal community, what I'm looking for is to find a sense of belonging,"" Courtney Nuttall, author of ""Tribal Nation"" argues, ""the tribe is being left behind."" In one of his theories, Nuttall suggests that the tribal members are left out of the process because they are not eligible for federal tax benefits because of their race. The tribe instead uses their tribal language to get to know the wealthier members of the tribe. The people of the tribe know the tribal members better than the other members. Nuttall notes that Nuttall's theories are based on the same assumptions that underlie many tribal members' disenfranchisement. ""One member of the tribe has gone from being the most qualified tribal member to a person that was the least qualified,"" he writes. He also believes that the tribe's culture and traditions cannot be reconciled with the legacy of ""what's wrong with our tribe."" ""Tribal members don't have a divine right to be tribal members and, in fact, they have been living in isolated circumstances for centuries,"" Nuttall says. There's no reason to think tribe members should have a personal problem unless it's a personal issue. What Nuttall and Courtney Nuttall seem to agree on is that the ""forgotten tribe"" needs a way out. ""We have a way to go forward,"" Nuttall says. We have to grow up. We have to learn to respect our tribes and then learn to disagree with them. Because they are right here to stay. Root's thesis is not the only one out there that's got a problem with the ""forgotten tribe,"" but there's a whole lot more to the story.

194,"Poll: White working-class Americans have complicated view of Muslim immigrants - poll - RT America Published time: 5 Mar, 2017 13: 47 A new survey by the Pew Research Center (J) shows that white working Americans are experiencing a complicated view of Muslims, despite all of their concerns. Overall, white working-class Americans are saying they are ""concerned"" by what they see as the growing number of Muslims in the country. Overall, white working-class Americans are more likely than non-white working-class Americans to say that they are ""concerned"" about Muslims. Just 21 percent of white working-class Americans say they are ""concerned"" about them (from 35 percent of all Americans). The survey, which surveyed more than 1,000 working-class adults from April 23 to March 25, is based on a survey of 1,462 adult Americans. The results are similar to a similar Pew poll from October 2016, in which 43 percent of white working-class Americans were concerned. Both surveys showed that only 40 percent of white working-class Americans were concerned about Muslims. The Pew study found that people were also more likely than non-white working-class Americans to think that the ""Muslim ban"" is ""counter-productive."" In 2015, 26 percent of white working-class Americans said they are concerned about Muslims. This makes up about one-fourth of the total. The most recent Gallup poll, released in April, showed that only 28 percent of Americans have a positive opinion of Muslims. Most of these numbers are based on the latest Pew poll. The poll has an error margin of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. According to Pew, the increase in the number of Muslims in the US is not directly related to the immigration conversation. It is a ""diverse population"" that tends to be more predominantly white, with people of Asian descent, European and Central American descent. Muslims are also less likely than non-Muslims to say they are concerned about Muslims, according to Pew. The average age of the American working-class is 34.3 years old, the highest in the developed world. In 2015, the average age of a working-class person in the US was 32.4 years old, compared to 24.7 years for other groups in the US. The average working-class person is also older than 65, compared to 20.3 years for other groups. The US has seen increased Islamophobia and hate crimes."
195,"Working class whites blame Washington, but still want more government help The main reason for the disparity in educational attainment between the rich and the rest is that those who are working class are less likely to get into college and go on to earn higher degrees than the middle class, a new study shows. When researchers studied the educational attainment of people who were at or below the poverty line, the middle class averaged about $13,000 higher than the bottom half of the income distribution. Working class and lower-income whites had similar educational attainment, the study found. The middle class had the lowest education attainment at $7,439, while the bottom half had the highest at $8,490. The gap grew to $6,077 for families with incomes above $200,000 a year, and the gap widened to $15,073 for families with incomes above $200,000. The gap also widened for people with incomes between $50,000 and $75,000 and for those with incomes between $100,000 and $217,000, the study found. The study was conducted by McKinsey & Co. ""We are pleased to see that the gap between the highest and lowest-income and highest-income American adults has narrowed,"" the study's lead author, Robert Fink, senior scientist with McKinsey's education initiative, said in a statement. We hope the results will be an important reminder that working class families have to work harder to make a better life for themselves and their families. The report did find that the wealthiest 10 percent of households with annual incomes of $300,000 or more had the lowest educational attainment, while the bottom half had the highest. The most educated group, the bottom 20 percent, had a similar educational attainment. The report ""provides an important national picture of working class communities and suggests that inequality affects education levels across the country,"" Fink said. The report was published in Pew Charitable Trusts' Quarterly Educational Trends. It was based on an analysis of 201 surveys conducted between 2011 and 2014. The study was paid for by the Guttmacher Institute, a think tank that advocates for demographic and economic justice. The study has been published in Eatology & Medicine.

Donald Trump is a white working-class voter who is passionate about building an America that works for everyone, regardless of race, gender or class. And the scale of his success will be far-reaching for a political party that is already in danger of becoming a collection of segregated races, as voters increasingly take to Trump's rhetoric that rails against ""both sides"" and calls themselves ""a country that works for everyone."" The Guardian's film team went undercover at a predominantly black high school in South Carolina to look at the makeup of the student body.

197,"The economy stinks, but I'm doing OK, say working class whites For those who are struggling to find decent work, it's no wonder that people are rejecting change. A poll of 1,000 working class voters by Ipsos MORI found that more than a third were undecided on the economy. More than half of those surveyed said that job insecurity was their biggest concern, and another quarter said they would vote Tory. The poll, published yesterday, found that 36 per cent of the people surveyed were undecided, while 24 per cent said they were likely to vote Conservative. The survey, revealed yesterday, also found that nine in 10 people said they would vote Ukip. For those who are not sure whether they would vote Tory, the results of the poll appear to point to a much bigger problem - the rise of the Labour Party. A majority of those polled said Mr Miliband would be the best leader of the country, while a third said Mr Cameron was too left wing. Ed Miliband is the best leader of the country, according to just one in 10 voters (file picture) But the poll also found that 44 per cent said that they would vote Labour, compared with just 21 per cent who said Mr Miliband was what they wanted to hear about the Labour Party. The findings are likely to be seized on by the Conservatives as evidence of the party's weakness in the polls, which have seen Mr Miliband's rating slide at an all-time low. Mr Miliband has called on Mr Brown to do more to help ordinary people achieve better opportunities. However, the Prime Minister has yet to say whether he will now back a Labour leader - despite Mr Miliband's personal popularity.

At least 200 people are feared to be buried under mud and rocks after heavy rains caused the worst flooding in decades in Sierra Leone's capital city of Freetown. Xinhua / Zhang Qinglei MALE, Sierra Leone, June 10 (Xinhua) -- At least 200 people are feared to be buried under mud and rocks after heavy rains caused the worst flooding in decades in Sierra Leone's capital city of Freetown, officials said on Wednesday. The death toll from the floods in Freetown, where the Ethiopian capital was hit by heavy rains in May, stands at more than 200, said Dr. Isaac Afewude, a spokesman for the Sierra Leone Ministry of Water Resources and Engineering. There has been more rain since the rains began. ""We have not been able to visit the area where the mudslide occurred,"" Afewude said. We're still waiting for the army to arrive. About 200 trucks have been mobilized to help with rescues, he said. At least 200 people are believed to be buried under mud and rocks after heavy rains caused the worst flooding in decades in Sierra Leone's capital city of Freetown, officials said on Wednesday. ""The Mudslide took place in an area of about one square meter,"" said a spokesperson of the Ministry of Water Resources and Engineering. A total of 254 houses have been demolished, while three dams in the area have collapsed, the spokesperson added. The government's emergency response team is coordinating with the military in case a further rescue operation is required. The Defense Ministry has dispatched two of its helicopters to the area. ""We are already mobilized to help those in need,"" a defense ministry spokesman said. The flooding has also damaged infrastructure networks in neighboring countries.

201,"Drug addiction: There is help and not a prison Cocaine use 'affects hundreds of thousands of people in Britain each year' The UK is the only country in the world where people are addicted to the drug, according to the charity, which launched a campaign in the 1980s to try to end drug abuse. It said heroin use is now at its highest level in 15 years - up by six per cent. ""The drug market is controlled by a few very sophisticated nations which seek to exploit that market,"" said Mark Porter, head of policy and campaigns at the charity, whose members include the Royal College of Psychiatrists. However, it is a serious problem. Cocaine users are at greater risk of using other drugs, they are more likely to end up in prison or in prison. A growing number of people are taking drugs that are becoming more addictive. Cocaine use affects hundreds of thousands of people in Britain each year. There are currently more than 3m people in the UK who take heroin - more than half of whom are adults. ""We need to make use of the available evidence,"" said Mr Porter. What we don't want is to see people who have had an addiction for many, many years incarcerated having to go back to rehab. Drug users must know that taking cocaine is not an addiction. It's a risk and it's an addiction. He added: ""We also know that many people who use cannabis are addicted to other drugs as well."" A recent survey of more than 1,000 people across the country found that more than half had used heroin in the past month - around one in 10. A report by the Commons international affairs committee said addicts had ""become the people who keep people trapped in drugs."" Almost one in eight have used cannabis in the past year, and more than half are using cocaine, heroin and cough syrup. The report said: ""If you are experiencing drug and alcohol disorders, you are more likely to develop a problem with drugs, alcohol or antidepressants in the next 12 months."" The British Medical Association has said that doctors who treat patients who have been exposed to heroin use can be ""overwhelmed."" More than 1,000 people in England have called for a ban on heroin use - including in prisons - according to NHS figures that show drug use is at its highest level in 15 years.

202,"The impact of a little boy named Youssif will never be forgotten. A second hearing will be held on Friday when the matter of whether the boy should face trial is anticipated. Youssif is in detention in the Iraqi city of Irbil. His hearing is expected to be held on February 22. He was arrested in August 2011 over claims of involvement with Al Qaeda in Iraq, but had been released under the terms of a US-Iraqi security pact that allowed him to be transferred to the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The Pentagon said it did not know how much the boy was earning. The Pentagon said it was also not aware whether Youssif was paid in cash or in ransom payments, but said the boy was an ""American national"" and he could not ""expect"" the government to return him to Iraq. He would not be allowed to leave the US, the Pentagon said. A Pentagon official said: ""The United States does not want anyone to leave Iraq without being returned."" The boy was captured in a raid on the Iraqi capital's most notorious police headquarters in May 2007, and his capture drew international outrage. He was later transferred to the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay. Iraqi officials had said in early March that five other alleged terrorists were already in the same cell as Youssif. The men, all Saudis, were charged with involvement in the murder of an Iranian security personnel at a Kuwaiti oil tanker in 2000, and the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October. The group also has been accused of involvement in plots to blow up US-bound planes. The US government says the group was funded by Saudi Arabia. The group's lawyer, Gregory Craig, has said he believes Youssif was tortured and tortured and has denied any links to Al Qaeda. But on Monday, he said Youssif was in the ""final stages"" of being tortured and was in fear of death. In March, the Pentagon and European Union, US and UK officials contacted Youssif about his case. The government initially denied the claims but eventually agreed to release him, after a tribunal found the prisoner's torture was inadequate. The UN has said that all prisoners in Iraq have been subjected to torture. The US military has said that it does not hold any control over the alleged tortures of detainees."

207,"Workers fight for rights at 'ground zero for US slavery' Union members at New York's ground zero are fighting for the rights of workers who walk off the job to be reinstated and given back wages. Workers at the World Trade Center site claim to be being denied their wages because they are on rostered shifts. It is a campaign that has been backed by both unions and Donald Trump. ""I think what has to be done is we're going to get the minimum wage back,"" said Tom Quinn, a member of the union's construction union. Since the attacks, workers say they are still being paid a rate of $7.50. ""I am not aware of any other American worker that has gone down that same ground zero to be refused wages as an employee,"" said one worker, Paul Guria. I know that the trade center was built so that we could be able to support and help those workers, that we could provide some basic services and security for those workers that are employed there. Those workers include dozens of families trapped in the ruins of the World Trade Center. However, many of them have not yet been reinstated. For them it is not just about reinstating their wages but also getting their jobs back. ""We're fighting to get them back,"" said one woman, Sid Ginsberg. The people of Staten Island are fighting for their jobs and for us to have access to their wages, to their healthcare, to their pension. The people of Staten Island are fighting for their jobs and for our rights. The workers have taken to the streets to press for more worker rights. They argue that the city should pay workers less than what they are legally entitled to. The New York City Law Department has proposed that workers be paid $8.03 an hour for overtime and $10.10 an hour for unionised workers. But the employers say there is no way to comply with the law or remedies that will alleviate what they believe is a longstanding problem. On Thursday the mayor of New York City said the city is reviewing the issue. In the meantime he says the city is providing a $7.15 entry fee for the workers and is trying to remedy any problems. The site is still under construction and is expected to open in 2018. More about: Bomb blast, Freedom of speech, USA, New York City, US presidential elections, New York"

209,"Thousands forced to work on Brazil's cattle ranches More than 300,000 people are now on the brink of starvation in Brazil's cattle herds, with two-thirds of workers unable to work due to hunger, according to official figures released by the Farm Ministry on Thursday. The average income for a family of five ranchers is about 350 euros ($419) per month. ""We have many people who have no income, or when their income is less, it is difficult to survive,"" said Rodolfo Garcia Caetano, an official of the agriculture ministry. The Brazilian government has set up a commission to address the issue but said that the majority of those affected had been receiving little or no assistance. The country is the world's largest exporter of beef, and Brazil has been the backbone of the country's agriculture industry for decades. The number of cattle ranchers in Brazil has dwindled by more than 90 percent over the past decade to around 5,000 due to a drought. The country is still recovering from several years of recession, which prompted the government to introduce a huge programme to make agricultural production more efficient and to give priority to the country's rural poor. That subsidy made major contributions to Brazil's overall economic growth in the second quarter of 2012, with gross domestic product (GDP) rising 2.8 percent over the year. The agriculture ministry said the worst drought in decades in Brazil was particularly bad in the southern states of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo, where the drought has forced thousands of people to leave their ranches. The government has also been trying to improve the country's agricultural production by cutting red tape and improving grain-growers' management systems. But it is facing repeated criticism from farmers and graziers who say the government has not done enough to tackle the problem of soaring food prices and poor farming practices. To combat the problem one ministry proposed that the government set up a research programme which aims to understand the causes of food prices to help people cope with it. They also said the country should work to improve infrastructure, particularly water networks and sewage plants, reduce carbon emissions and introduce a carbon tax. The ministry also said that it would set up a research program to help the poor and improve agriculture. The project will be funded by the government and the private sector. In a statement, the ministry said: ""The government will ensure the development of economic and agricultural sectors to create more jobs."""

""Her Majesty has been informed of a serious outbreak of coronavirus which has been confirmed in the UK,"" his physician said in a statement to the Press Association. ""Her Royal Highness will remain in hospital whilst she is under observation and her husband, Prince Philip, will continue at home with her,"" they added. The Queen is not in any danger, she is still in good health and will continue to be in London at this time. Coronaviruses are a bacterial illness responsible for the commonest respiratory and salivary glands in the respiratory system. Infection can lead to death from sickness caused by an illness or injury. Symptoms of coronaviruses include fever, coughing, shortness of breath and chest pain. At least three deaths have been reported in the UK. The Royal College of Physicians in Britain said last week that the number of people infected by the virus had reached three, while experts have warned levels are likely to increase in the coming days. Last week, the WHO said that the death toll from the current outbreak in West Africa could now exceed 5,000. Officials are concerned that this figure may reach 10,000, with estimates suggesting that as many as half a million people could be infected. The latest outbreak came just weeks after a woman in the UK contracted the virus after visiting the Caribbean. It left her critically ill and she died in hospital two days later. More than 450 people in nine countries have been now infected by the virus, which causes severe acute respiratory infections. It is spread by contact with infected surfaces. Some people develop the illness after touching objects such as cutlery or carpets. This is particularly common at holiday resorts and schools."
215,"Riz Ahmed 'breaks up' with Britain in an emotional album and short film 'The Long Goodbye' Riz Ahmed, the British actor who plays a Muslim on HBO's ""The Night Of"" who goes on the run with an American woman, is breaking up with his long-time partner in order to focus on his career. Ahmed's announcement that he and his partner, British filmmaker Yasmine Cendoya, have called it quits comes after months of speculation, including a recent interview in which the actor declined to confirm whether he and Cendoya, 33, were officially divorced. Ahmed -- who is also known for his roles in ""The Night Of"" and ""The King's Speech"" -- said in a statement that he was split from Cendoya ""in order to focus on my career."" ""I am broken up with Yasmine and I have decided that the time I have left with this beautiful partner is now the right time for me to focus on my projects,"" says Ahmed. I am not relocating from London, I am not moving anywhere else. I want to focus on my films and my writing. I am not leaving my family and friends. Ahmed, who is originally from Jamaica, was first spotted with Cendoya in late August at an event in New York. Cendoya, an Indian-American activist, said at the time that she met Ahmed and spoke to him through an American website, but that her then boyfriend was not at the meeting. She said the pair had ""not seen each other for a year,"" adding that she didn't know he was an actor until she saw his photo on a Twitter account. She and Cendoya met through an Indian-American website, and had their son and daughter, now both aged 5, together in 2008. Cendoya said at the time that she was ""heartbroken and devastated."" ""I am in awe of Riz and his beautiful and inspiring work and I'm so proud that he has led such an amazing life journey,"" she said. I have two children to look after. I am so close to my children and am so proud of what they are achieving. Ahmed said he will try to raise funds to raise money for a charity that supports refugee refugee children. ""We are working as a team, and we will be working hard to make a difference,"" he said."

In their view, the UK should accept free movement of people and EU citizens from the EU. But, while it would be a blow to the EU's ""unity"" after it leaves the bloc, we believe the benefits should not be underestimated, writes Purnell. The EU should take advantage of the opportunity to put Britain back on the path to economic recovery and prosperity, writes Purnell. The Conservatives are ""unashamedly pro-European,"" writes Purnell, but ""it is not simply about Europe: in fact it is about Europe's membership and the European idea that it is a civilised place. So if you want to come to a conclusion about a Brexit that is fair, is just and fair, you need to come to a conclusion about an institution and the relationship between the EU and Britain.

""The UK needs to be"" unashamedly pro-European ""to have any chance of joining the European project, writes Purnell, and the EU should be"" pro-European ""to take a step back"" from the economic and political crisis that began in Greece and Spain. ""Meanwhile, David Cameron has called for a"" robust ""debate between Europe and the UK to"" get the best out of Brexit. ""He told reporters in Brussels that"" negotiations are not yet finished. ""But despite the frank calls for an early debate, David Cameron insisted the economic case for staying in the EU was"" strong. ""He said:"" The European Commission and the European commission have said that the EU is for us and Britain is for them and for Britain. These are excellent words from a prime minister who wants to see a robust debate. But there comes a point when the argument that we are the only country on the continent of the United Kingdom on the margins of the economic and political debate makes sense. It is not a debate about the cost of membership or indeed whether we should leave the European Union because the costs would be too high and it would be too difficult to make an offer that would satisfy all of the member states. The other 27 EU leaders have said in recent days that they are open to the idea of ""closer union"" if Britain has to opt out, which would"
217,"No-deal Brexit is back -- and it looks more likely than ever that the UK will be forced to leave the EU. So the pro-Brexit campaign is back, and it could be even more disruptive. On April 22, Brexit will result in the UK leaving the EU. And if the other members of the EU agree, in practice, on what happens to the trade agreement, the UK will seek a special deal to stay in the single market, which many people, including the Prime Minister, have long argued would be better for Britain. If this doesn't happen, however, the UK will leave the EU, regardless of any government deal agreed. It's becoming clear that the pro-Brexit campaign has decided that the best way to avoid a no-deal scenario is to simply vote down the Government's Chequers plan in an attempt to push them through. It's an approach that has been used to push the Prime Minister to back down and the Cabinet to back down on her Chequers alternative. If May does not fall, the pro-Brexit Tory Party will have to step forward and support the Government. But if all else fails, then the pro-Brexit media will only be able to create a frenzy about the government's Chequers plan. ""The Liberal Democrats will provide a full policy document on Chequers,"" said a Conservative Party spokesperson, ""with no details about what the Government will propose."" While there is some debate about the costs and benefits of a Chequers deal, there is no shortage of options to persuade the British the best deal is still better than no deal. One solution is to try to secure a customs union with the European Union, which would enable the UK to control its own borders and operate its own trade policy. This would also ensure the UK retains its membership of the customs union, as do a number of other EU states. But the biggest test of the pro-Brexit campaign will come next March, when the public will get the chance to vote on whether to leave the EU or remain in. If they say no, the most likely scenario is a no-deal Brexit. The UK faces a difficult choice, but either way, the alternative isn't only more extreme and less likely that a hard Brexit will happen.

218,"UK courts will now livestream divorce proceedings: lawyer LONDON (Reuters) - The judiciary will be livestreaming the divorce proceedings of British divorces during proceedings, as part of a change in the way criminal litigation has been conducted, a court spokesman said on Thursday. Courts in England and Wales will now watch what is happening in the divorce proceedings of divorcees via a live link on the internet, under changes announced by the National Crime Agency (NCA) in July. ""The NCA recognizes that the use of social media plays a part in the way divorces are conducted,"" said a spokesman for the NCA. We have therefore decided to make this available to all court users. At present, all court litigation is recorded in one place, so judges and lawyers can discuss their cases in one place. It is likely that the move will encourage more divorces and bring an end to what many see as an unfair and unjust system. As part of the changes, the NCA is also considering how to use social media to improve the way divorce cases are heard. It is unclear when the livestream will be live.

It is a very different disease, ""said Dr Sheppeard. The virus is also spreading around the world. In Hong Kong, a man who had recently returned from a trip to north-east Asia was confirmed with the virus after arriving in the city on a flight from Singapore. He was the fourth person to test positive for the virus and was being treated at a hospital."" The virus differs from the common cold virus in that it does not travel in the air, ""a Hong Kong health official said. It is extremely contagious and can cause a high fever and severe muscle pain for several days. In Taiwan, there have been a few deaths from the virus, although Taiwan's health ministry said at least 13 other people were infected. In Vietnam, the country's deputy chief medical officer urged people not to share blood with anyone they believed was infected, saying it could kill people. The WHO is taking advice from the World Health Organization, which is monitoring the spread of the virus in three key countries: Uganda, Bolivia and South Sudan. The agency has issued a global travel alert and urged health workers to be vigilant for any new virus and to inform the public if they have had contact with them. The virus has been spreading from Africa because of an outbreak in Angola which began in 2007. The Angola outbreak hit a number of countries including South Africa, Nigeria, Angola and Haiti. There have been no cases in Scotland or the UK. It is thought that a number of people have died in countries around the world. The latest outbreak in Europe is believed to have been in Germany. The World Health Organisation is now working with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to investigate the outbreak. No cases have yet been confirmed in Canada and UK. It is unclear if the disease is different to the one in Scotland. The Scottish government has confirmed that only one case of swine flu has been confirmed, but the risk to the general public remains low. A total of 1,462 people in Scotland have been diagnosed with swine flu. The majority of cases have been in children and in adults, but the number of deaths has risen from around 30 to 50. Of those, 116 have been in NHS Lothian. There are no suspected cases in the UK."

The team is also working to develop a new generation of hydrogen cars for the industry. ""In this short window, there is still time to achieve a new hydrogen-powered car,"" says Professor Mike Wooldridge of Manchester University and a member of the team. I want to see hydrogen-powered cars enter the world, not only to meet our growing emissions of greenhouse gases but also to bring people further from the catastrophe of nuclear accidents to the road and bridge environment, thus reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Dr Mark Sinclair is the lead researcher on the study and is also a consultant for the project. The goal is to make hydrogen-powered cars commercially viable in the UK and around the world. Further information is available at: http: / / www.indycollection.com / hydrogen-power-car-project / Hydrogen is a key element in the evolution of battery technologies. Hydrogen has been the industry standard since the dawn of time, but the evolution of fuel cells has enabled them to take on greater energy efficiency and reduce the use of fossil fuels. The world is moving towards renewable energy sources such as hydrogen, wind and wave power, so the creation of hydrogen has been a long time in the making. Although hydrogen is also used in a lot of components, such as tyres and fuel cells, there is still a long way to go. The researchers believe that hydrogen will have to be replaced by any other fuels that are not environmentally unfriendly. This is also a big change, with new technologies being developed that are far more efficient, which could be the future of hydrogen fuel cells. ""The development of fuels for vehicles has moved on significantly, but we still have a long way to go in terms of hydrogen vehicles,"" says Dr Wooldridge. The future will be one where, with hydrogen filling the gap left by fossil fuels, hydrogen vehicles will be commercially viable. This article was originally published on The Conversation.

221,"What does Britain know about coronavirus that the rest of Europe doesn't? So what does Britain know about the new STI? A coronavirus is a type of influenza that is spread to humans by an infected person. Symptoms of the infection include fever, chills, chills, muscle pain and red eyes, but most people recover from it without needing medical treatment. In the UK, only a tiny proportion of young people have been infected and it is considered contagious to others. The disease is spread through direct contact with an infected person who is infected with the virus. The vaccine, which is free of charge, is effective in preventing infection. What is new about this new virus? It is a new strain of the STI that is different from the one that has yet to appear in Europe. The new strain is called ""one of the most virulent strains of STI"" and is typically spread by direct contact. It has infected 287,000 people since it was first identified last year. What role does this new virus play in the UK? The new strain is from the same family as the one which struck the UK in 2013. The new strain is a separate strain from the one that has yet to appear in Europe. It is a strain from the same family of viruses that has been spreading around the world. What is new about this new virus? Britain's Chief Medical Officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, said the new strain had the potential to cause ""a significant increase in the number of people who are currently infected with this disease and of whom the disease is one of the most serious."" She said: ""There is absolutely no evidence it is going to be the next wave of STIs. It's just something we should be preparing for. What is the current estimate for the spread of the virus to the UK? The estimate from the National Public Health Service (NPHS) is based on how many people are now infected. The number of new cases of this virus is expected to fall in the coming weeks. If the virus continues to spread it will be the first time any of Britain's four public health bodies have experienced an increase in new cases of the disease over the past five years. According to the NPHS figures the actual number of cases will be around 3,500. What is the most common case of a new strain of the virus reported in Europe? The most common type of coronavirus is the strain of the virus that has"

Dr Paul Seymour, who oversees the global pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, said he will keep working in his role until his condition improves. He said he was responding to a statement from GSK contracted the virus to its UK chief executive last week. The boss said that he now had a ""low grade coronavirus."" Dr Seymour is understood to have tested positive after returning to the UK. Shares in GSK are currently down around 5pc on the news. GSK issued a statement late on Thursday, saying it had not yet received the full report of the latest case. Its statement said: ""We have been informed of a possible exposure to the strain of the virus. The company is working closely with its colleagues in the UK and is co-operating with World Health Organisation colleagues. The GSK CEO added:"" I am continuing to work in my role as CEO until my condition improves. As a result of my positive test, my medical director and I will remain in the UK to ensure the best possible care for my colleagues at the moment. I will continue to work closely with my colleagues at the company to try and minimise any relapses in the treatment process and to prepare for the risk of infection in our employees. Last week, Dr Seymour announced he was stepping down as chief scientific officer of the company, which makes prescription medicines for the general public. In a statement on Thursday, he said: ""I would like to thank my wonderful team at GSK for their commitment and dedication towards the development of the company. My family have worked extremely hard to provide me with a world-class medical facility to serve them and the staff.

It can track and treat it and there are a number of other vaccines that can help. The best thing we can do is remain vigilant. For me that means not wearing shoes, particularly as it could be potentially deadly. What is typhoid? Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection that develops after a person is bitten by a virus. People can contract the disease from contaminated food or water contaminated with the disease, although it is not considered to be a serious illness. It usually affects one in 1,000 people in the UK. The symptoms of typhoid fever include: Severe headache nausea vomiting stiff neck stiffness Irregular heartbeat (dizziness) vomiting drowsiness (confusion) loss of consciousness or paralysis loss of awareness Source: NHS Direct The NHS also has a vaccination programme for common household pathogens. It includes the MMR jab, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella after it has been vaccinated. A spokesman for the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said: 'There are a number of important questions for The Mail on Sunday to ponder before we come to any conclusions. The MMR vaccine has been proven safe and effective in preventing infection among young children in the UK and across other countries. We would urge anyone who has concerns or is concerned about their child to speak to their GP or contact their local pharmacy. This is an extremely important topic and it would help us to understand any potential risks, if any, raised regarding the vaccine or its side-effects. However, the safety and effectiveness of any vaccination is of the utmost importance. The MMR vaccine is not an approved product for human use. The MMR vaccine is recommended for healthy people who are not at risk of becoming infected by measles. It is given as part of the childhood immunisation programme. Anyone can get the MMR vaccine if their GP tells them they have it. The vaccine can also be given to pregnant women who are at high risk of the infection. The NHS has said it offers the best protection for both the mother and child and is available over the counter from pharmacies."

The success of ""Wolf Hall"" or ""Tudors"" in terms of box office sales is uncertain. But a 2013 ""The God of Carnage"" film and a revival of ""The King's Speech"" from the Weinstein Co. are possibilities. Both are in the works. Their production values are in the high $20 million to $30 million range, with ""The Bible"" in the $20 million to $30 million range. The ""The King's Speech"" screenplay has written by Tom Hooper (best known for ""The King's Speech,"" a movie in which he directed) and has been adapted from Shakespeare's text. That book, a comedy involving a Jewish princess, is scheduled for a 2013 release. And this week will mark the 20th anniversary of the publication of the ""Wolf Hall"" novel, which was published in 1861 and was adapted into the award-winning film ""The Imitation Game"" by the late Richard Burton. With the new ""Wolf Hall"" and ""The King's Speech"" sequels set to come out in 2013, audiences are becoming more sensitive to the nature of their story, said Michael Green, the president and managing director of the Universal Pictures Group. ""There is a more profound impact than meets the eye on how a story reaches the audience,"" he said. The movie, which is being produced by Netflix and its first movie, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"" is to be directed by Rupert Goold and stars Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron.

The test kit, developed by the school's biological research centre, is due to be tested on the UK's first Ebola patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, after his death from the disease in December. Duncan, who was travelling to the West African country with the help of a Liberian man, died at the centre after contracting the virus in the UK. The Department of Health said it was working with the relevant international partners to develop a vaccine for the disease. It said it would be ""an exciting opportunity"" to develop a test that could detect Ebola in early stages when it is already circulating in other parts of the world. The Department of Health said it was working closely with Welsh, British, Scottish and Northern Irish students to develop a test which could detect Ebola in early stages when it is already circulating in other parts of the world. The UK Department of Health said there was no time limit for the scientific research centre to start developing a test kit but said it will support plans for a UK-wide testing programme. A spokesman added: ""The UK is leading the way in combating this deadly disease and it is right that we use this knowledge to help respond quickly and effectively to the threat it presents. To this end we will work with the relevant international partners to develop a vaccine for the disease.

Italy's deputy health minister, Riccardo Egolo, told reporters that the number of cases of the deadly virus had risen to 4,033 in the first three days of the outbreak, up from 2,438 a day earlier. ""While it is early days, the public health situation is complicated because the situation is still developing,"" said Egolo, adding that the government's priority was to find out the truth. Health authorities in the northern city of Turin had been monitoring the water of the Aquila, home to Italy's most famous lake, where the outbreak started on 8 June and has now spread to its neighbouring regions. The Aquila is one of the region's biggest tourist attractions and sits at the end of the River Torrens, across from Sicily's famous Colosseum. The virus causes fever, severe headache and muscle pain, and can be fatal once untreated. Last month, Italy's health minister, Beatrice Lorenzin, said that the first phase of tests on the water that has been affected by the outbreak would be carried out by the end of this month. She said the goal was to ensure there were no more cases and that authorities could do their utmost to contain the outbreak. ""All health facilities should be alert for any new cases,"" Lorenzin said. Italy's economic health minister, Vittorio Grilli, has warned that the epidemic poses a severe threat to the economy, with the number of affected people already hovering around 24,000. Italy's weather agency has issued a red alert - the second highest - for the entire country. Italy is one of the most highly-polluted countries in western Europe. The World Health Organization estimates that Italy contributes more than 50% of global greenhouse gas emissions. More than 400 people have died from the virus in Italy since it was first identified in March. The country has also had three outbreaks of measles, including one that was declared over in April. Italy has had only two outbreaks of Ebola - one in 1999 and in 1976. Health authorities in Rome have been trying to limit the spread of the disease by installing an electronic health system."

Prince Harry has been in Russia for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in the city of Vladivostok. He is currently on a 10-day tour to Russia, where he is visiting veterans of the war in Afghanistan, and has been invited to join the Russian President Vladimir Putin for the upcoming summit in Helsinki. The Prince is currently training with the RAF's Search and Rescue Force and he will fly to the UK for a number of exercises. Prince Harry served in the Army for three years, with flying colours from the regiment. He was deployed in Afghanistan in 2008, and has since completed several tours of duty in the Falkland Islands. He took part in two major events in Helsinki earlier this year, including a visit to the Royal Navy Academy Sandhurst. He met the Queen and Prince Philip at the Royal Albert Hall on Wednesday. The two were photographed together during the visit to a hospital in St James's Palace. Prince Charles was also at the lunch. The Prince was expected to meet Princess Beatrice, who recently married billionaire businessman James Stunt, and the Duchess of Gloucester, who is expecting her first child. However, Kensington Palace later clarified that it was Prince Charles that met Beatrice. Originally, the Prince was in Moscow to join the Chinese president."

In a speech in London, she also opened up about her marriage to singer Jamie Hince, and whether she's seen or heard any of the celebrities speaking recently. The F1 event hosted by Piers Morgan and Piers Morgan in Battersea Park is a celebrity live event, a once-a-year, cross-media extravaganza. Goulding said she and Hince, who is a host, have been together for 16 years, and still speak on the phone almost every day. She added: ""We've not had a chat in years. The idea of F1 is so far beyond the pale. I remember we used to leave a bunch of emails to each other. So it's amazing that we are so well connected but we're not. So we sit on the same sofa right in the middle of the summer, and I'm still using the computer and talking to each other. We still have the same things in common. It's so exciting. Everything's so connected. It's a different way of living. What's great about the F1 is that everyone's got a voice and everyone's got a platform.

231,"How do you beat high-flying Liverpool? Watford's Christian Kabasele reveals all By Joe Bernstein for The Mail on Sunday Watford defender Christian Kabasele has said that beating Liverpool on Sunday is one of the best feelings of his career.'It's one of the most important days in my career, 'said Kabasele, who enjoyed a purple patch as Watford won 5-0. It is one of the best feelings. I was involved in a game like this and I want to enjoy the moment. I want to play on Sunday to help the team but it's a big game. I hope we can get three points. The Hornets have been in fine form, winning their last five league games and are six points behind second-placed Tottenham. Liverpool, who are 11th in the league table, could go level on points with Arsenal at the top of the league with a win against Watford on Monday. Watford will be looking to keep the pressure on the top four and secure Champions League football next season.'I'm looking forward to next week and I've been lucky enough to score a few goals in the past few weeks,' said Kabasele.'It's difficult to play against teams from the lower leagues. We've been doing well in some games but we need to keep our feet on the ground and stay focused. 'Watford, who are 11th in the league, have opened with three wins in their last four league games. They beat Manchester United 2-0 at Old Trafford in September and then beat Bournemouth 1-0 at Vicarage Road last month.'It's always good to score against Liverpool. We play against teams who are higher up the table,' said Kabasele, who has been capped five times by England, including in the 2015 World Cup. I came to England aged 23 and scored in the 2-2 draw against Germany. They played badly at Old Trafford and got punished. We played a great game against Tottenham. The fans were great and made us feel proud. Liverpool have not lost any of their last five league games. They are unbeaten in the last five. It is a big game for us. Watford are on a good run of form under manager Marco Silva. They have won four of their last six league games to climb to 11th in the table.'It is good for the confidence of the team, but we have to keep winning and finish the season as high as possible, 'said Silva. We need to come out with the right result."
232,"Airlines extend waivers, adjust schedules for Europe travel ban WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration said on Wednesday it was extending waivers for four months to allow certain air carriers, including American Airlines and United Airlines, to continue flying to Europe as a precaution against a ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries that President Donald Trump imposed on January 22. Last month, U.S. airlines waived the travel ban, which still applies to the United States, and waived other restrictions on Syrian refugees. The Obama administration said the move would allow airlines to operate flights to Europe, allowing them to resume flights to the United States on a limited basis. In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said airlines would be allowed to resume flights to Europe on a limited no-fly basis if they complied with the directive. The waivers are being made in response to a court decision in December in favor of the travel ban, which U.S. District Judge James Robart said was unnecessary. In a similar case in 2016, the Supreme Court overturned a ban on travelers from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen seeking to enter the United States with their spouses and families. Earlier this month, a federal appeals court in Seattle ruled that the travel ban was unconstitutional. A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the administration, but stayed the ban pending the Supreme Court's decision. The Department of Homeland Security has until March 5 to appeal that decision.

233,"Europe travel ban: Will it be possible to sneak into the US via the UK? This story has been updated. This article was originally published on 5 June 2017. It was originally published on 5 July 2017. The White House is to make a decision on whether to appeal for a temporary restraining order to block the US President's executive order on immigration. On Thursday, they will announce their decision. How does it work? The president's order blocks asylum by refugees and refugees and restricts travel from six Muslim-majority countries to 10 others, including Iran and Syria. They also suspend the US refugee programme. That prohibition was first imposed by the Obama administration in 2015, but was later suspended and then renewed by a federal judge in March. The ruling was issued against a temporary restraining order by the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals. The order was also temporarily stopped by the Supreme Court of the US in November. The Trump administration then appealed against the ruling to the Supreme Court. Under the revised order, refugees who have been detained by US immigration authorities would be barred from entering the US for 120 days. Those who have been detained for 120 days would be blocked from entering the US and could be charged with a criminal offence. The restrictions would be lifted in a two-year period. When is the EU ruling expected? The European Commission says on Friday that the court ruling will be given by the end of the month. The commission has said it will issue a statement with a statement on 29 January, which will say the ban is unlawful. If the court agrees with the rulings, it could be at the end of the year. How does it work? The US has been urging the United States to ""withdraw"" from the ban. It would be almost unimaginable for the Trump administration to let the ban stand without a second opinion from the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which will hear the case on 17 January. Can a ban stand? The Trump administration is expected to take the appeal to the Supreme Court, where it would be likely to rule in favour of the ban. It would then have to appeal to the Supreme Court. The ban was blocked by a federal judge after being challenged in court by the state of Washington. Washington has appealed the decision in federal court. The government has urged the Supreme Court to weigh in on the issue, saying the president has the power to limit immigration. The Supreme Court will decide whether to hear the appeal."

He had been suffering from cancer and heart failure, with his family describing him as a ""hero and a true pioneer."" He was born Bernard Roux and started his career in New York in the late 1950s as a chef at the French Laundry, before moving to France to open a restaurant in Paris. My first restaurant was in Paris, when we had 16 or 18 vaunted restaurants. And then we had it in New York and it was named, my restaurant, ""he said. The chef, who started out in New York, also cooked at the Carlyle Hotel in New York in the 1950s, before moving to Le Gavroche in New York in the 1960s. His newest restaurant, Le Cordon Bleu, will open in Paris on 22 June. In the past his family have described him as"" one of the original American chefs of the time.

235,"Dealer drops Asian assistant from London art fair due to coronavirus' anxiety' A suspected coronavirus outbreak at London's Frieze Art Fair has forced the UK's biggest art fair into suspending its fair after 40 guests fell ill. Frieze London said it had suspended the show between Monday and Tuesday night. The fair has been a hotspot for celebrities such as Damien Hirst and Damien Hirst, and is held each year in London, with its annual ""Frieze Masters"" gallery. Frieze spokesman Elaine Murphy said the fair would not be able to continue, adding she could not comment on the reasons for the suspension. She had no further information. Gallery director Stephen Deuchar said he was not aware of any cancellations. ""We work very closely with our partners around the world and we are deeply saddened that a significant number of artists have been affected by this virus,"" he said in an email. ""We're working under the assumption that the fair will resume in a very short period of time,"" he said. We are working closely with our partners and we are fully prepared and we will continue to advise and support the affected parties. The fair is due to close in a few days. Fields in the galleries are closed to visitors while authorities, including police, conduct a test of the show and the London ambulance service have asked people to wash their hands after arriving at the fair. The fair is one of the most prestigious art fairs in the world, attracting some 800,000 visitors a year and generating around £30m for the city's economy. About 40 artists have been diagnosed with the illness and two have died. Last year's fair had to be brought under control after 23 people fell ill, including six who were admitted to hospital. Among the victims last year were the Russian artist Ksenia Osakova and the Japanese painter Kenzo Takada. Last year's fair had to be moved from the Savoy as a precaution. Frieze London is a major international contemporary art fair and takes place in London every year. It attracts celebrities, royals and the public. The fair was recently voted the most influential exhibition in the world by ArtReview magazine. It runs until August 9. Previous years have seen a number of cases of coronavirus being confirmed at Frieze. Last year's show was cancelled in June due to the virus."
236,"Mark Neville's semi-authentic portraits spotlight 'ecotopias' and a forgotten side of France In the absence of the ubiquitous photo albums and magazine photography of the past 20 years, many of us now live and work in the cities or suburbs of these cities, and many still have no natural home. They are hard places to find, but a new book, Mark Neville: Stories of Life in the City, presents a fascinating and unstructured history of ecotopias, how our world has changed, and how it is changing, in the face of a changing landscape. The book gives us a glimpse into the creative process behind creating large-scale photographs and a chronological snapshot of the ecotopia in a landscape filled with fragments and other ephemera. The book, which is sold by Artisan, is a celebration of the work of Neville's fellow photographer Mark Neville, who died this year aged 91. In the book, Neville has been portraying the ecosystems that have given way to the ecotourism that has been the preserve of many people for over 60 years. The book includes photographs from his personal collection and is published on 4 November. ""I think there are a lot of ecotourist photographers in the world today,"" says Neville. They don't get much recognition and it is no different when they are portraying the ecology that these ecosystems have given way to. I personally believe that ecotourism is a wonderful way of life in the 21st century and many people see these pictures as part of that.

237,"Biking to work appears more dangerous than other commuting options, study finds - RT UK commuters can become ""more dangerous"" when they ride to work, with a new study suggesting they are more likely to be killed or injured on the roads. The research found rivalries between car-using commuters and those who are not have been reduced dramatically - with the risk of being killed or injured increasing. The study, published in the British Journal Of Sports Medicine, added that the risk decreased between 2005 and 2016 as people on the move focused more on other things, including driving. The report also said that while rivalries between commuters and those in car ownership increased the risk of traffic fatalities, it was more common for people who rode to work to be more involved. One in six cyclists killed or seriously injured on UK roads in 2016 were from cars. The study, which used data from the Department for Transport's Office for National Statistics (ONS) on the percentage of accidents involving cyclists, found that drivers were more than twice as likely to be killed or injured as those who weren't on the road. This was up from one in seven motorcyclists who died or seriously injured in 2006 / 2007. Researchers said that accidents caused by those who bike had increased by 42 percent since the 2013 peak. However, the number of fatalities involving people who rode to work has dropped by nearly a quarter in a decade. ""Unless we tackle the issue of cyclists riding without a helmet, we risk losing a generation of cycling enthusiasts to traffic fatalities and injuries,"" said Dr Maria Newman, a research fellow at the University of York and the lead author of the study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. The study also said that while other studies have suggested that motorcyclist deaths increase when people are on the move, the research showed little evidence that such an increase was due to better-designed cycle infrastructure and safer roads. The study was conducted by the government's Road Safety Research Unit (RRR), which advises the government on various transport matters. ""While traffic fatalities are a very visible part of the public transport network, it is important to remember that this research focuses on only a very small part of the population,"" said Dr Newman. It is only in the absence of reliable evidence that we can draw comparisons with our own research to properly assess the impact of motorcycle riding on road safety."

240,"What the kimono's wide-reaching influence tells us about cultural appropriation and social integration is a complicated issue not only for the poor, but for the affluent and the affluent, too. The kimono has emerged as one of the most celebrated knits of all time. The kimono has come out as one of the most honored knits in the cultural fabric. The kimono, as it is called, was invented in 1897 by Italian artist Giambattista Sanfilippo, who believed in the enduring link between the woman's body and the craft of creativity. Today, in a nation that prides itself on its high quality of life, kimono makers have come to be associated with something very little meaningful here. That being said, there's a lot that we don't know about the design of the kimono, which is why we're so interested in seeing if, for instance, it spins, or when it gets to the end of its life. I didn't get to see how the kimono's mouth moves to the end of its life, or how its lips move. I didn't get to see how its legs move to the end of its life, or how its limbs move to the end of its life. I was also not given the opportunity to observe how many other kimonos were made by these artists, who used the ""phimono"" as a kind of veil. The kimono in question was a kimono, one of two made by Japanese artist Eero Saarinen. The other, a kimono made by French sculptor Vincent van Gogh, was a kimono made in 1888 by Dutch sculptor Verner Goufflet. Unlike other kimonos produced by Saarinen, the kimono does not have a spinal column. What's interesting is that this is the third most popular fashion item of 2017, with more than 1,200 items sold in the United States alone. So why do we keep getting so surprised? Because we're all paying attention. We really need to. The kimono isn't just a symbol of the city, it's a symbol of our cultural heritage. It's a symbol of the creativity of the Italian community. The kimono is a symbol of beauty, and we need to represent it."

Now a new app, called Taobo, is bringing it even closer to the huge demand. The app will allow users to purchase a facial to help with the most obvious cosmetic surgeon - a procedure that has to be done by qualified Chinese surgeons in their home country. The app is designed to help people choose the most suitable plastic surgeons and also offers the latest technology for surgeons to use, such as 3D CT scans and Botox. But it's cheap - comparable to many other apps available in China - and requires a special $US30 ($A40) incentive. Taobo can be downloaded from the Apple App Store or Google Play, and the company said it has already had more than 10,000 downloads of the app. However, that doesn't count the extra cost of the procedure. The app will cost $US9 ($A11). The app boasts a free $40 ($A60) annual membership. In China, customers will be able to buy the app for only $US2 ($A4.94). There is also a $US1 ($A0.38) annual service fee. Although Taobo is not available in the U.S., it's available in other countries. The company did not release any specific pricing figures.

Catherine Opie, a global beauty brand director at beauty company Avon, says that the industry is ""in a state of flux"" and she believes beauty has to encompass more about the human condition. She said beauty is part of the human condition and can be applied in a positive way. ""Beauty can be used as something that in so many ways, we would all agree is important,"" she told ABC News. But the beauty industry is in a state of flux, and we need to do things on our own terms. I believe in what we do, but I do not believe in the beauty industry as a whole, as a whole. She said beauty can be used as ""something that in so many ways, we would all agree is important"" and that the industry was in a ""good place."" ""For many, there is a role for beauty in the fabric of society and for businesses to play in the process, as well as the potential for the beauty industry, to be a good partner,"" she said. ""I think that beauty in general has to encompass more about the human condition,"" she said, adding that she believes beauty has to be seen as part of the wider human fabric. She also noted that for many people, beauty is an ""essential part of their daily lives."" I personally believe that beauty can be used in a positive way and I think that is what will define beauty. But Ms Opie said she does not believe it is ""a necessary part of our daily lives"" and that the industry needs ""to be more radical."" There are no ""magic bullets"" for beauty and beauty industry growth. ""Skincare is very important to me,"" she said. Our industry is growing at the rate of 10-15% a year. I believe in this industry, and I think beauty is a natural fit for our world.

""red"" is a more traditional red - the lipstick's natural colour and texture are slightly different. It has been seen as a way to express identity, which is important, given that it's a symbol of female emancipation and is also a symbol of sexuality. As a result, in the US, red lips are one of the most popular shade shades of the year, according to the American Optometric Association. Not only is it one of the most desirable colours of the year, it's also one of the most popular colours of the year.

246,"Photographer Kyle Weeks uses his medium to show that manhood in Africa is not a singular image. It is, rather, a struggle for the rest of us. In the end, the question facing us is why we do what we do. We see the power of our choices in the body of the photograph, and the truth is that it's important to us to see that these images are also not simply pictures of a young man's face. Rather, they show the way the body of a man is being manipulated in ways that make us look at ourselves in different ways. In an age of technology, the challenge to our ability to look at the world in a different way may be on the rise. It may also be that a generation of young people is starting to look inward again, looking to their bodies and asking why we shouldn't want to look at ourselves in the same way. As a photographer, I've been working with some of the most exquisite images I've ever taken. The beauty of the photographs is that the images are often very beautiful. The way they are taken is stunning, and the people in them are wonderfully alive and well. These are not photos of a young man, these are people who are feeling their way through the world, looking at ourselves in a different way. The other things I've spent time on a photography trip in Africa over the last decade are about people's lives, places and emotions - and often the subject matter - of these photographs. The photos are of a young man in his 20s in an incredibly intimate moment. I think that the images do it justice, they send one message to the world that these images are not just photos of me - but real people. Kyle Weeks is an international photographer based in Johannesburg. He was selected to shoot the images by the British Association for the Advancement of Colour (ABC), who saw fit to collaborate. The images are available on http: / / www.royal.ac.uk / jrWeeks and http: / / www.facebook.com / jrweeks. A selection of the images will be shown at the ABC's Africa Open, the world's largest open-access photography competition, taking place at the Royal Geographical Society, London, on 29 June 2011 and 24 June 2011, and run from 7 - 9 June, 2011.

248,"Graciela Iturbide's images reveal untold stories of indigenous Mexico By Christopher Knight Last Updated: 10: 23PM BST 12 May 2009 The Mexican artist, who is based in New York, has made a series of self-portraits of the region's indigenous people to mark the 50th anniversary of the independence of Mexico. Her photographs, which are displayed everywhere in her studio, offer a detailed history of the area's people, the largest indigenous population in North America. Iturbide said: ""I started taking pictures in the 1990s, at least in the late Seventies. I started setting up my studio in a remote area of Honduras, where I discovered the language and culture. I took three images of the traditional tribes and, all of them, were very important for my art. Iturbide, who grew up in Mexico, is best known for her portraits of her father's subjects, an ancient tribe called the San Isidro Colchoneros, who were forced from their land by a huge earthquake in 1971. Since then, she has made a number of small, self-portraits of her subjects and has even photographed them and their families in their native language. She has also created more than 70 works of art and has exhibited hundreds of her portraits at the Frieze Art Fair in London. Iturbide is a painter whose work is well regarded internationally. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in the US by the University of Illinois in 2008. She said:"" I am not an artist just to explore the world. I am a photographer to create a sense of life and to tell an amazing story about these people. Iturbide began her career as a painter to get attention from her American friends, and by the end of the last decade she had written more than 30 portraits. Her latest exhibition is a self-portraits called Mexico, from Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina and Brazil. Iturbide has also created portraits of people who were born in the region but who were not able to speak it. The exhibition is at the National Museum of Anthropology, Tuxtla Gutierrez, in Mexico City until June 23. The exhibition will be open during Mexico Day on May 15. Admission is free for children under 16. For more information or to book go to www.theguardian.com / mexico"

The driving enthusiast has made his living by travelling the streets of Tokyo, capturing the city alongside the city's skyline. He's also found time to keep his chauffeur entertained with a collection of artistic photographs. Here FEMAIL reveals some of his most eye-catching chats... 91 shares The images show the world's most popular drivers - from the world's most famous to the world's most popular. His collection of taxi snaps include a group of Japanese characters, a man who is seen jumping from a moving car and a woman who is seen wearing a leopard-print jacket and sunglasses. He is also pictured shaking hands with the drivers and performing acrobatic stunts. In other bizarre scenes, he even manages to pull over and pick up a model in a yellow dress. The series of snaps were taken by 38-year-old photographer Hiroyuki Ota, 43, who uses a camera on his iPhone to capture the city's skyline. His work has earned him a new nickname in Japan, called 'chubby chubby'. Chubby drivers are known for their outlandish behavior - with one man pictured getting out of a moving car and taking a high-five while driving. Others have come up with creative ways of making fun of the drivers. The most surprising feature of the collection is the car driver's dashcam. The driver in the pictures can see the world clearly. This isn't the first time that Ota has captured the drivers faces of drivers behind the wheel of their cars. In 2014, he captured the drivers behind the wheel of their limousines. Here FEMAIL has put together a selection of his chats to look back on. Want to share your own transport photos? Email samantha.rahman @ mailonline.co.uk or tweet @ davidhorsey @ mailonline.co.uk.

The Louvre Abu Dhabi, in the city's famed Mogadishu neighbourhood, is the world's first publicly-funded museum dedicated entirely to universal human creativity. While other museums display much of the arts of the world, the idea behind the Abu Dhabi museum is to establish an uncentralised, modern collection of artworks, sculptures and other cultural artifacts. ""The museum is not just a museum but a unified centre of cultural work,"" says Mr Al-Amram. It gives people and places of worship, and it connects them to the world. The idea is that art and culture should interact, with more than just its text, and that people can find connections across cultures. The museum is free to the public, but donations can be made to the Abu Dhabi museum through the online platform. See also: in pictures - the Museum of Fine Arts in the new Dubai.

252,"How it's made: Backstage at Tommy Hilfiger's global, celebrity-filled show, the designer's first collection, was filled with bright, bold creations in muted muted tones of navy tones. ""I wanted to make a statement for Tommy, and I wanted it to be bold and playful,"" Hilfiger said backstage. I wanted it to be very much about the world in the sense that it was about a woman - and it was very playful and very feminine, a very feminine woman. The collection was also slightly more sophisticated (with a lighter, more sexy vibe). One of the most popular looks was a black sequined dress, the form of which is usually on display in the store. The label created a range of separates, as well as the looks for the men's man's and women's collections. It was the first collection from Mr. Hilfiger's new line of men's and women's shoes. ""I wanted to be very empowering for women,"" Mr. Hilfiger said backstage. I wanted it to be relevant for men. For men, it's important to create clothes that get the women's attention, that have an emotional impact. The line's debut collection was topped with a more eclectic mix, featuring sportswear designs in a variety of muted colors, textures and prints, like this one. A few pieces were a bit more pared down: a black tuxedo jacket with gold trim and a tuxedo-style white shirt with white sleeves. The collection, which is available through February, also included a statement dress in muted tones, that featured a red leather jacket with a black belt. It was followed by a more relaxed collection for men with matching tailored jackets. The collection was also inspired by the collection of the British designer, Stella McCartney, who is part of the men's line, as well as by the collection of Mr. Hilfiger himself, as well as the new men's shoes. ""You can go out and look like you've stepped into a modern-day McCartney menswear store with designer shoes, but I was inspired by the idea that the McCartney men's shoes were inspired by Stella McCartney,"" Mr. Hilfiger said backstage. And so I designed some of the new shoes for the women's. They are more feminine, more playful. But they are fun."

254,"'Part of the conversation ': Outspoken artist Anish Kapoor opens retrospective in Beijing ""A lot of the conversation was not about the criticism of our work, it was about the difficulties we faced, the difficulties we experienced,"" he told the Xinhua news agency. Mr Kapoor's new installation, entitled' The Art of the Twentieth Century ', depicts scenes created during the last quarter of the 20th Century, including the famous cartoon image of a woman with a dog holding a flower in her mouth, which has been pulled off a wall in Tokyo's Shuichi Museum, drawing the ire of feminist groups. ""The humour and the satirical material in the new work were unintentional but were intended to show that the Twentieth Century was a time of great change and a time of great change,"" said Ren Yu, a member of the Twentieth Century Committee, which oversees the international art scene. The exhibition runs until August 26. The Chinese artist has been outspoken in his criticism of the development of China since 2004, when he founded the museum in Beijing called the National Gallery of the People. His work has also been exhibited in the UK and is often exhibited in Hong Kong. In 2006, however, the Twentieth Century Committee called for his removal because of his ""extreme views and anti-China sympathies."" The Twentieth Century Committee made the decision to remove him due to the ""ongoing political situation of China in the north-central regions of China,"" said Mr Ren. In January, Mr Kapoor received death threats from local officials, who accused him of ""spreading anti-Chinese, anti-Tibetan, anti-Islamic and anti-Chinese propaganda."" China has so far tightened controls on foreign cultural exchanges with several groups. A representative of a pro-democracy group said he had been attacked by a group of men while visiting Beijing. Zhang Jing, 34, told the Japanese news agency Kyodo that he was attacked from behind when he tried to enter the capital's Tiananmen Square. He said he had suffered a broken nose. ""I am not afraid and I will continue to fight against the suppression of my basic human rights,"" he said. The Beijing News reported a police official saying that Ms Zhang ""jumped from the fifth floor of the mall and landed on a bicycle."""
255,"Olafur Eliasson on what art can do to fight climate change The artist Olafur Eliasson, a former head of the Norwegian government, has set out precisely what art can do to address the growing threat of climate change. In an open letter to the Guardian, he expressed the hope that the world's art collectors would follow his example. He says: ""Artists are creating art because of the fact that they want to make a difference. In order to do that, they have to do so because of the way the world is changing. The art world is changing in ways that are, in my mind, a direct consequence of all of this. Eliasson, who left the Norwegian government in May, went on to be a key architect of the climate change deal between the world's major industrialised nations. He has previously suggested that art should be seen as a tool to deal with the effects of global warming."" The problem is that it is the people, as much as the institutions, that are responsible for the problem, ""he says. We should not make art out of a responsibility that belongs to us. But we can do that if we all act together. Eliasson, who grew up in Trøndelag, is an artist based in Norway, and has previously spoken about his dislike of violence and the risk of the unknown."" It's the same as the way the Nazis are, ""he says. They talk about the danger of the future and the threat of the present, but they don't set out to talk about the best future for us. They talk about something that is happening now? It's a very serious threat to the future. The artist says he believes that art has a responsibility not to take sides, and that they should be prepared to make sure that, if they did, they were prepared to support nature and the environment. He says:"" I think art is a tool for doing something that is urgent but then it's not necessarily something that you can protect. It's something you can contribute to the world. Eliasson's latest exhibition, Climate Solutions, is at the British Museum from 23 July to 1 August. The art world has been flooded with a number of controversial speakers this week. Last week, the artist Gillian Wearing, a former winner of the Turner Prize, spoke out against climate change, saying: ""The world is warming faster than we think."""

Visitors can still meet the artist and get an up close look at the paintings. The exhibit is free and open to the public and museum visitors. 4 / 8 President Obama is the first sitting president to visit the museum. He will see a painting of himself that was painted in 1873, and a painting of himself that was painted at the time. This one will remain in the museum until 2016. 9 / 8 President Obama visits the White House. Obama visited the museum as a child. He was 7 when the painting was first shown, and for many years, he sat in the gallery during his parents' visits. There was never any question that the painting was a real painting, as it had been painted in the 1870s. The painting is valued at more than $6 million. One of Obama's brothers, meanwhile, is selling some of the artwork that ended up in the Obamas' mansion. It's titled, The White House Years. The painting is expected to go for more than $19 million. Related: Obama's portrait sells for $16.4 million at auction ""This is the first time in my life I have had a portrait since I was a kid,"" Obama told the crowd during the museum's exhibit, according to CNN. It's just incredible. The painting depicts Obama as a young man in a jacket, sunglasses and a hoodie, and Obama as a young man walking through a backyard with his family. The painting will be auctioned off for charity. ""I've always loved painting,"" the president said. I wanted to do something different, a more edgy, more abstract take on my life. And I did that. The president was also shown the portrait he painted in the Oval Office in 2013, a gift from then-President Barack Obama. A different version of the painting is also up for auction.

Last year, the prize went to Italian architect Cristina Nogueira for her work in the northern city of Timisoara.

Ms Nogueira has been a well-known architect in Italy and is the creator of the Palazzo Grassi, a building that was designed by French artist Jean Nouvel. Ms Nogueira, who is currently living in Florence, is an Italian national. In her acceptance speech, Nogueira said she had been ""struck by the respect that women's achievements are showing in the world of architecture."" She said she was delighted to have won the prize, but had been ""shocked"" at what she described as ""a historic moment in the history of women in architecture."" ""I have been struck by the respect that women's achievements are showing in the world of architecture,"" she said. ""I am very proud to be recognised for my work and I'm very happy that the prize has given me time to think about what it means to be an architect,"" she added. Prizes have been handed out for the architecture, literature and physics categories since the award was founded in 1984. Previous winners include Alexander Calder, Mies van der Rohe, Antony Gormley, Elfriede Jelinek, Frank Gehry and Frederik Renner. The winner of the prize has the right to publish their name, age and address, although the prize is only open to the public. The winner of the prize must be an Irish citizen or resident of the EU. Commenting on the award, the president of the Pritzker Foundation, the charity which awards the prize said: ""The Irish National Institute for Technology commends Pritzker Prize nominees on their achievements and their contribution to the development of modern architecture."""

263,"Mona Lisa for $60K? The curious market for Old Masters replicas The market for iconic Old Masters replicas that were first displayed in Paris in 1880 is growing, with some online auction houses offering the piece for as much as $60,000 (£49,964). Experts say the reason for the interest is the fact that the pieces were not seen by the public for a long time. ""The rarer the replica, the more valuable it becomes,"" said a British collector, who asked to remain anonymous. The Old Masters and original manuscripts of the two centuries later would have been sold to private collectors in the US, such as the National Sorting Office in Washington. But the new sale began last Tuesday and is to go through on Thursday. The Old Masters replica was displayed at the National Sorting Office in Washington. Photograph: Sang Tan / AP ""They are very intriguing,"" said Patrick Hale, author of the book, The Old Masters: A Memoir by Claude Monet, which was published in November. There are only about 40 of them left, because they were too prized and fragile. They're not owned by a museum, so they're not going to be on public display. They are going to be on loan to museums. The buyer's name has not been released, but the auctioneers at the auction house are believed to be the same one who bought the painting of St James the Gent at Christie's in London in 2008. Monet, believed to have painted the image in 1881, sold it for $48,400 (£35,987) at Christie's in New York last month. As well as the Old Masters replicas, some parts of the collection which are in private collections are available on eBay for less than £500. In the US, a recent auction for a bronze sculpture of the Virgin Mary was described as the most expensive ever sold at auction. It set a record price of $153,800 (£115,776). The sculpture is expected to sell for between $100,000 (£79,325) and $200,000 (£152,000). The price of the original statue was $842,950 (£55,333). In February, a Washington woman, a university administrator and a historian bought a bronze statue of the Virgin Mary from an eBay auction house."
264,"Under Xi's rule, what is China's image of the 'ideal' man? The leader of China, Xi Jinping is also the country's most powerful politician, with the power to sack the country's leaders and dismiss senior officials. His critics call him a dictator and say his rule has failed to improve the living standards of ordinary people. Since coming to power in 2012, he has said China could never be as prosperous and strong as when he was in power. In November, China's parliament passed two amendments which would give the government wide-ranging powers to appoint people to top positions in state-owned companies. China-watchers will be watching closely to see whether these amendments pass. Here's how the changes work: The new National People's Congress China's top legislature, the National People's Congress (NPC), meets every three years. It has a two-thirds majority, and the NPC is made up of a broad group of lawmakers from regions and rural areas. The central government meets at the same time, which takes place in November, every five years. The NPC was created in 1949 after Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution. The party is led by Chairman Mao and his wife, Jiang Qing. The first meeting is to be held on October 12. Most members of the Standing Committee oversee the NPC. The second meeting is on November 11. The top position in the Standing Committee is reserved for the party Chief, and the chairman of the Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) is the party's highest ranking official. The CCDI has now been handed the task of carrying out an investigation into the downfall of former Communist Party boss and disgraced politician Bo Xilai, and has been accused of covering up the murders of British businessman Neil Heywood. In November, the NPC was dissolved after a probe into Bo's death. There are still a few divisions among the NPC's members and a new Standing Committee is appointed to report to Xi. However, it is not clear whether the new body will have much influence on the political structure of the country's leaders. The NPC, like the Communist Party in China, has an inordinately powerful role in China... Its existence is not always reflected in the media, ""one commentator says.

266,"Seoul's burgeoning drag scene confronts conservative attitudes -- and how to avoid it Seoul is a city of drag -- and a city where a new movement is emerging to challenge traditional ideas of transgender people. It's the scene that has been created for the upcoming ""My First Class"" festival, organized by South Korea's largest private clothing manufacturer, the Chun Chae-Hee. The inaugural festival was organized by the Ministry of Culture, Arts and Leisure and was attended by more than 200,000 people in Seoul last year. In its first year, the event was open to foreigners, with a maximum of 200 participants. The aim is to promote the idea of gender-neutral spaces in the city, as well as to promote gender equality in the workplace and academia. ""Our first-class event is a celebration of all things transgender,"" said Chun Chae-Hee's marketing manager, Jeong Sung-Hyun. We've created an event with a positive message and a very positive message for the broader community. It's a kind of public relations message from South Korea. Every community has its own place in the world, but there are many different interpretations of it, ""he added. The festival was founded by Chun Chae-Hee in 2006, when he spent four years in his spare time in Seoul, and he went on to run the company for four years, beginning with a business model that includes a store that sells clothing and accessories at street fairs. Chun Chae-Hee says the company is now able to offer the same product at a lower price, and he's hoping that gender-neutral spaces can become a way to engage transgender people in the workplace and academia. We want to make the transgender population feel a part of the workforce. This is a way of building pride as best we can,"" Chun said. The festival is set to continue through Feb. 19, and organizers said more than 100,000 attendees are expected to visit South Korea next year. In the months ahead, Seoul hopes to welcome more than one million visitors, including a huge number of students from the United States and South Korea. Chun Chae-Hee also hopes to have a major impact in the fashion industry. ""The Korean beauty industry is opening up to international retailers,"" Chun said. It's an exciting time for the Korean beauty industry when we have international brands coming to the market."
267,"Menswear has never been so casual. So why is the image of a man in uniform still so alluring? Because the man is indeed male, and in so many ways so attractive to women - and men - that it always seems so absurd to have a male-in-uniform in the fashion business at all. And that's definitely going to change. Fashion is, after all, a male's job, and in a world full of female-dominated industries, men should not have to do anything that is objectifying. And while men have to have a certain amount of girth to be a good-looking man, women should be comfortable with that. For men in their twenties, it's unlikely that in his new job he'll have to wear a tie. In fact, of course, he's the only person in the country who can be assured of it. But it's going to take a little time, a little bit of patience, and he's going to have to get used to it. And they'll need to understand, and they'll be fine. And that's probably why it's so interesting that the men at his wedding are wearing ties. As for the ladies of the runway, they're going to have to be a little less sure of themselves, and more confident about their business prowess. And it's only logical that all the men who are photographed wearing ties will be wearing them. And right now, the only way to see what they look like is to check out the men who are wearing them. The only way to see the men in the photos from the ceremony will be to walk to the hotel or club and walk the rest of the way to the reception. The dresses will be a little more casual, much less revealing, and the men will be wearing them a little differently. To see the men wearing ties in the fashion industry, we'll have to go to the shops. Men wanting to see the men wearing ties in the fashion business, that's a big part of why it's so interesting. The fashion industry, and its people, just got the whole thing figured out. And they have had their say, because it is a lot easier to see them, so they're not going to have as much of a problem. So they can relax, enjoy themselves and leave the rest of the world to their own devices. They're a lot happier. And they're going to find a place, a new city, somewhere."
268,"Brazil's fashion industry has a diversity problem. For one thing, it's very socially conservative. The industry is predominantly white, male and Christian, ""says Claudia Lago, head of the Fashion Academy in Rio de Janeiro. The sector is also a traditional family brand. And also, as a mother, a daughter. Sao Paulo Fashion Week has also changed little. It's not the same as other fashion weeks; it's a family affair with the theme being children. So the parents have a bit of a different identity,"" says Ms Lago. Not everyone is comfortable with the trend of gender segregation. Brazilian fashion is a place where women prefer to dress in silk, but men prefer to wear black. Iconic Brazilian designer Suzy Menkes says that as a black woman she does not like how this is reflected in the industry. Image copyright AFP Image caption Suzy Menkes has been involved in controversy with the fashion industry for as long as she has been a woman, however In Brazil, it's not that rare that designers are seen as mimicking the traditional gender values of the family. For example, the designer and designer of the brand Ferragamo, Pedro Paulo, is revered by many as the father of modern Brazilian fashion. But, some argue, that's an overly simplistic view. ""It's not very subtle and it doesn't necessarily cause people to be offended or to complain,"" says Maria Alonzo Castro, a Brazilian fashion expert with the Brazilian Council for Research on International Finance. You have to respect the fact that this country is, in fact, a country where people can dress how they want and not be offended by it. At the end of the day, if the choice is still a mimicry, then you have to take it, if not you have also to respect that you're creating a choice. But that's not the case everywhere.

As of Wednesday, the U.S. was still not officially notified of the new development, but if it is, it would be the first time an American government has used a luxury vehicle in the form of a missile defense system. According to the Journal, the vehicle was part of a larger group of vehicles for Kim Jong Un's fleet, including a Mercedes-Benz E-Class SUV and a UAV. They were outfitted with a variety of heavy armor and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, and the vehicle had a four-speed manual transmission"
270,"Ryugyong Hotel: The story of North Korea's' Hotel of Doom' In the late 1960s, a group of North Korean diplomats and their families moved to Ryugyong, a former military convent in Pyongyang. They then started a construction company that built hotels and apartments and a nearby government complex and continued to work at the hotel's Ryugyong Pavilion. It was later revamped into a luxury hotel with a luxury swimming pool and spa - and a new underground water park. The hotel was known as the ""Hotel of Peace"" after the former North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, who called it ""Uncle Jong Hyon."" But most of the owners left before the hotel opened in the 1950s. In the late 1980s, though, North Korea rebuilt the hotel, which was a symbol of the regime's military might. The hotel is now hailed as a symbol of the country's ""new international relations,"" and the government has reopened its doors. In the weeks before the hotel opened, North Korea had been building a monument to Kim Il Sung, who ruled from 1948 to 1954. He was assassinated in 1994. In the article ""North Korea, The Unknown Hotel of Peace,"" the photographer John Feinstein writes about the opening of Ryugyong, his memories of North Korea and his work looking at North Korea today. He recalls sightseeing there on his first trip to the country in 1977 and sees firsthand how the country has shaped North Korea's image today.

272,"The unsung car designer who created the DeLorean and James Bond's underwater car The DeLorean was considered a classic car and its iconic status was built upon by the design of the Aston Martin DB4. Built in the late 1930s, the car was first produced by Robert Walliams in the late 1930s. Built in London in 1936, it was first made by the company's team in 1934. It was a lightweight sports car, but the car also served as the basis for the James Bond films. The Aston Martin DB4 was popular with military officers in World War Two, and the car was also used by the British and American forces in World War Two. It was developed by Aston Martin to achieve a unique design which was also seen as a vehicle for action. It was the first car built by Aston Martin, and the first of its type to run on petrol. It is one of the most high-profile examples of a classic car built by Aston Martin. The car has made more than 300 appearances and attracted a number of celebrities, including Sir Richard Branson, Bob Dylan, Richard Burton, Johnny Depp, and the film director Martin Scorsese. In 2006, the Aston Martin DB4 sold for more than £10 million at auction. The car was one of a number produced by Aston Martin for the British and American military during World War Two. The car was made in Scotland in 1931 and was auctioned on 14 February 1995. The car was the first of its type to be made in Scotland, and the most recent model to be built by Aston Martin. It had been owned by the team for much of its life. Its name comes from the original word ""DeLorean"" in a sequence of letters. The car was first launched in 1976 by Roger DeLorean, who was the managing director of Aston Martin from 1968 to 1982, when it was first introduced to the public. The company produced more than 1,200 cars and sports cars, including the DB4, DB5 and DB6. The car was one of ten made by Aston Martin between 1976 and 1983, when it was finished in the US. It was one of the most famous Aston Martin cars, with its distinctive twin-turbocharged V8 Vantage. It was first produced in America and then sold abroad until 2002, when it was bought by the Abu Dhabi-based Investment Authority."

274,"Battle of Supremes: How 'legal fakes' are challenging a $1B brand name This year's battle to be the most recognized of the year in the name game of ""legal fakes"" is taking on a new meaning for the term. When a law firm launches an investigation into a brand, it is usually on a much larger scale than the one before. Companies and legal scholars have long debated how to define these companies, in part because they are often different from their predecessors, but also because they are more likely to be held liable for their wrongdoing. From the very first legal daguerreotype in the 1970s, there used to be legal fakes that were legal. But in some ways, they were always legal, ""said Ben Miller, a partner at Hogan Lovells in New York City and author of"" Legal Fakes, ""a guide to legal counters."" But more and more, as the number of class-action lawsuits have grown, we think that the brands are actually being held to the same legal standard as the ones before them, ""he added. The latest legal fakes being investigated by Hogan Lovells include a $1 billion lawsuit filed by a California man who claimed that a company called Coca-Cola caused him severe diabetes. Other legal fakes that are being investigated include one that involves the use of a fake website to make thousands of fake pharmaceutical ads. Another that was taken out of context in a 2009 lawsuit in the Southern District of Florida is a lawsuit brought against the Los Angeles office of a hedge fund manager who claimed he was defrauded out of $50 million by a company called Atelier Holdings.

The prosecution alleges the two have bribed government officials to secure a massive financial deal when he was the opposition leader. Mahathir was one of the first to publicly denounce the alleged corruption. Zunar faces up to 10 years in jail. The BBC has requested permission to view the trial. The trial was announced by Mahathir, the country's longest-serving prime minister. At the time of the allegations, he was still president.

276,"The designers changing the conversation around lingerie ""She's got an incredible body,"" the model said in a recent interview with The Paris Review. I think she's amazing in her own way; she's not a victim, she's a victim. She's the person I would want to be. In February, model Candice Huffine said that while she's not a size zero or 18-inch model, she's a confident and confident woman. The 32-year-old, who started modeling when she was 12, said that she's embracing her curves, and she's confident she can run long distances without losing a bit of weight. ""I've always been confident in my body,"" she told TODAY's Savannah Guthrie in March. I think that it's really important to feel confident about your body. I'm just very, very active in my life. And I'm so proud to walk a runway with curves that are so small and curvy. I mean, curves are so important to me... I'm so proud to show that. You see a model who's curvy and pretty. But you also see a model who's curvy; you saw a model who's curvy and pretty. You look at them and you see an actress who's curvy and pretty and and beautiful and beautiful and sexy and cool and sexy and a model who's a size zero or 18-inch. These are the people who are going to lose that weight. It's just not right. Last week, actress Jennifer Aniston said that she doesn't look like she has unattainable body standards. I think that fat people are just people that are built for a certain size. The way they dress is not the way they choose to look, ""she told E! News. I don't believe there is a perfect body type and women should feel empowered to feel empowered to dress how they want. I don't want people to feel like they don't have to dress. I don't want to feel like I have to dress to be the most perfect version of myself,"" she said. I don't want to feel like I have to dress like every other individual. I want to feel confident. I want to feel good about myself and that I'm working hard on myself. It's not about that. It's about who you are.

277,"Ceiling fans, brooms and mangoes: The election symbols of India's political parties Considered the most visible symbol of Indian democracy, the parliament's large ceilings are an important symbol of political power, but only because they often are not visible to the naked eye. That's because of the tradition of placing them at the heart of elections, in which the majority is represented by the minority government. The system of voting, known as the ""cadre,"" is a form of the Indian constitution, and aims to ensure that everyone has a fair shot at winning a seat. But the cadre is as much a symbol of political power as it is a symbol of democracy itself. It's one of the most popular symbols of the country's elections. In India, the cadre represents the majority of the population, but it also represents political power as well, as the party that wins the most seats in the next Parliament. And a cadre has to be proportional to each party's representation, because all the votes are proportional and all the seats are on the same party's list. The cadre is the kind of voting system most people don't even know about. But they do have a unique stamp, a simple red dot that stands for ""I am an Indian."" The three-colored dots are meant to represent a certain kind of power, or something like that. So instead of the traditional red dot, all the votes are divided into four segments: a red dot, a green dot and a blue dot. In addition, the red dot represents the percentage of the voting population, and those two categories represent the percentage of the seats each party will have. The red dot represents the percentage of the voters that don't know about the cadre. The red dot represents the percentage of the voting population. So the red dot represents the percentage of the voting population that doesn't know about the cadre. The red dot represents voters that don't know about the cadre, based on what they've heard during the election campaign. The red dot represents the percentage that doesn't know about the cadre. And the green dot represents the percentage of the voting population that doesn't know about the cadre. In an official statement, the Indian government says that it is not considering any further decree in the voting."
278,"The soft power impact of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's decorative collars, and the influence of William Shatner on her style. And it's all subject to the sword and crown of her hair. The political calculus of the woman who, for years, was known as the ""most conservative"" Supreme Court justice, but now has become the last one in a long line of lawyers to go up against her. How did she do it? In the days that followed, Ginsburg was often asked about the high court that she had held under her belt for more than 40 years: the high court. I'm not going to say I'm the most conservative justice. I'm the one that always said, 'No, you're wrong.' But, by the way, I don't really have another name. But, you know, I've been in this profession a long time and we've never really had a disagreement. That's what I was told by people about the court - that you could always say, 'No.' And I think that was true. What do you do while the bench is in session? I have a job that I do and I am a good husband, and I have a very strong wife. I am a good dad, and we have a lot of love for each other. We have a lot of friends and family members and I have a lot of time for everybody else. My father, when he was on the bench, and I was there, we were always working on the court. So, I'm not the least bit surprised. I don't think I'm the most conservative justice. But I do think I am the most conservative justice. I suppose the one who has had this much trouble with the court is Margaret, the Supreme Court justice. I think that's what she meant by 'justice at the hour.' What do you think about the current court? I think the best thing to do as a human being is to be on the bench and to follow the instructions that we're given. That's what I did well. That's what I love doing. But I don't think I'm the most aggressive or opinionated person that I know. That's what I'm trying to do. But I've always believed that when you're in my position, that I'm the most polished and most experienced. And I think that's what I've done well. We will be discussing that next."
279,"Why Beijing's Serpentine Pavilion signals a new age for Chinese architecture With the nation preparing to host the Beijing Olympics in 2022, the architect behind Beijing's giant pavilion has a message for those who don't want to linger on the same old ones in the same old buildings around the city. The Pavilion's original, $1 billion design, was canceled after the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Now it's back and the pavilion boasts a high-tech, interactive display that allows visitors to wander around it. As Hong Kong's Chief Executive CY Leung told The Associated Press, ""The Pavilion is a very important Chinese cultural project, and we are very excited about the opportunity it has opened up for us to exhibit and promote to a broader audience."" And the new logo, which was announced at the opening ceremony of this week's Shanghai Architecture Expo, is meant to signal that China is ready to embrace its new image as a design force. The Pavilion is part of a broader effort by Beijing to develop a more modern image, which is on the rise even as the economy starts to slow. In a sign of that, officials have announced plans to hand out $25 billion to help attract investment in local businesses, while Beijing is building more than $500 million worth of new hotels and apartments. China's capital is also embracing new developments with enthusiasm, with Beijing's Museum of Quality and Science, a sprawling cultural complex, opening this week. It also has a new theme park. ""The Pavilion is a very important cultural project in China, and we are very excited about the opportunity it has opened up for us to exhibit and promote to a broader audience,"" CY Leung told the AP in an interview. For those who don't want to linger on the old design, the Pavilion's original was still a landmark, but the construction has begun to transform its look and feel into a more modern and inviting space. The pavilion is being refurbished, and it looks as if its new-found relevance is still there. ""It has become the heart of the city and a symbol of Chinese cultural,"" said Hong Kong architect Lam Tsin, who designed the original pavilion. It has also become a symbol of the city's transformation. I think we can now move on to more innovative directions."

Kim Dong-yeon arrived in London from South Korea last week and spent time with the country's prime minister, Hwang Pyong-so. But his mission is likely to be different to that of the young pop star Kim Jong-un. So far he has not been to North Korea. Instead he has been meeting with the artist at his studio in the art district of central London, and is set to meet Kim Jong-un as part of his delegation to the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. Kim Jong-un is the leader of North Korea's ruling dynasty and has become the country's leader. He said he was happy to ""meet a person who has the greatest spirit and strength, will do anything for the people of North Korea - and may even go to the Olympics."" The art dealer said he would ""definitely go to the Olympics, I am in London to see the Olympics."" Kim, who has a collection of around 120 works of art, is the only person from North Korea to have been invited to London to see the Pyeongchang Games. The 60-year-old man said he had been encouraged by Hwang to meet him. A representative from Hwang said that he was not a North Korean diplomat and that he had never come to London to meet me.

So when President Trump mocked a British celebrity's outfit, it was probably the first time he'd ever referred to one of the country's most famous women as ""Jacqueline."" The President was referring to the fact that Jacqueline Kennedy, wife of the late President John F. Kennedy, wore a pillbox hat to visit the Queen at Balmoral in 1953. READ MORE: The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh head to Balmoral for Christmas The hat was a nod to the Queen's love of the pillbox hat, a hat that has been worn for more than 2,000 years in Britain. In the past, the Queen has worn the hat on official occasions, which often include the traditional Christmas carol service. The Queen wore it during her Diamond Jubilee year of 2002 and again during her Diamond Jubilee year in 2012. The hat is often worn by members of the royal family, although the Queen is an avid fan.

The President, who was known for his love of the UK's festive traditions, was previously criticised for choosing to feature himself in a photo of his wife on his White House South Lawn on Christmas Eve. His Christmas card was also criticised by the President, after he posted a photograph of himself in front of a tree in front of a decorated Christmas tree. The picture caused a storm of criticism for being ""inappropriate."" Trump's December greeting of the Queen and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, led to a string of complaints to the White House."

286,"Vintage photos show the unsung heroes of the US suffrage movement The United States suffragette movement had a new movement when it was born in the late sixties and early seventies. It wasn't until the late nineteenth century that it began to gain traction. The movement was born with the aim of 'defending and expanding the rights of all mankind'. For the women of America, it was a way to fight for their rights and freedom. In recent years, this movement has increased in popularity, regularly winning awards for its work. In 2017, it was nominated for the National Humanities Medal, and in 2018 it was inducted into the National Historical Association's National Heritage Hall of Fame. The National Women's History Museum has an exhibition about the history of the suffragette movement, which documents the movement's success and achievements. The early images are from various moments in the suffragette movement. They have been painstakingly colorized to give the illustrative look of the movement. One shows a group of white women, each wearing a mask of a white woman, and one is on a horse. Another shows an unnamed woman in a black dress, holding a 'Make America Great Again' sign. Women of the movement were protesting for freedom, equality, and the right to vote. The movement was initially opposed to segregation and racial segregation, but it was pushed by many other groups in the past years. The theory of the suffragette movement was that the movement could be traced to a movement launched by slaves and abolitionists in Boston in 1664. Historical images have been colorized to give the illustrative look of the movement, which has grown in popularity, regularly winning awards for its work Other pictures show the movement's first female member, Virginia Woolf, with her face painted. She is pictured in a black floor length gown with her hands folded. Another photograph shows Sister Catherine of Aragon, dressed in a red dress and carrying a 'Make America Great Again' sign. In 2006, the American Civil Liberties Union won a landmark case in the Supreme Court that outlined the rights of people of color to vote. It was ruled that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had restricted voting to African-Americans. However, the decision was overturned on appeal by the US Supreme Court. It remains to be seen if the case will reach the Supreme Court"

The moment, however, is to confront the darkening darkness that has swept through Venezuela for months, and to turn the page on the ""catastrophe"" that has brought this country to its knees and allowed those in power to sweep away its oppressive institutions. One of the most powerful men in the country, Nicolas Maduro, has just got out of bed and left the country for a two-week trip to South America, part of a major charm offensive that he hopes will take the country and the world out of the economic doldrums and into the 21st century. He is in the southern city of Maracaibo where he will meet with officials from the country's agriculture sector, the biggest sector in the country, and an agricultural union that is expected to represent some of the country's most desperate workers. The meeting will also touch on everything from the plight of the country's poor to the economic problems at home. In other news, Venezuelans are preparing to vote in a referendum on whether to keep Maduro as president or to throw his legacy behind him. A ""People's Vote"" will be held on 7 March that will decide whether Maduro should remain in power, if he is toppled. Polls suggest that, although he is the most popular leader in the country, his approval rating plummeted following his decision to recall the vice-president last year. However, the new leader is expected to be re-elected in 2018, so it's not too surprising that, for the moment at least, Venezuelans are focused on a referendum to be held on the issue. ""The people have decided to wait and see what the country's future will be,"" says one man, who has been campaigning to keep the president in power. There is no shortage of speculation, but so far it's easy to see why people are angry. I think a lot of people believe Maduro to be a very clever man, but I think that is something we should take into consideration too. He's a very complicated person. I think he has a lot of ideas and ideas, and I'm excited to see what he can do and see what he can do for our country. But I think there is only one solution."
288,"Savers are getting destroyed by super low interest rates. The most recent inflation figures revealed that the consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation was 4.6 per cent in April, down from 4.9 per cent the month before. It was the sharpest annual drop for five years. By contrast, CPI inflation last month was 5.7 per cent, down from 5.9 per cent in March. George Buckley, of Deutsche Bank, said: ""The big problem for savers is that the rate of savings growth has been so low. After a decade of decent returns on savings, it's no surprise that they are feeling the pinch. Consumer credit has been growing at the fastest rate in the last three months. The Bank of England warned in December that interest rates could rise again to combat the threat of a housing bubble. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted to extend the £325 billion scheme, which was launched in August 2006, by another three years to July 2015. It is meant to keep borrowing costs low but borrowers who pay more in interest on their savings will have their monthly repayments capped at 0.75 per cent and receive an extra £100 on their savings every month. The"" Funding for Lending ""scheme, which allows banks to use cheap credit to lend to businesses and individuals, is being extended for another three years. The Bank's Governor Mark Carney said:"" The situation in the financial markets is still fragile. We have to be wary of the danger that the fragile recovery could prove unsustainable and that the effects on growth could become more profound. The Bank's decision to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.5 per cent has helped to boost mortgage-lending, despite fears over defaulting on the debts on which it lends to businesses and households. The number of mortgage approvals rose to 158,745 in April, up from 156,890 in March - but the number of mortgage approvals rose to 98,416. The total value of mortgage approvals in May, excluding house purchases, fell to £2.5trillion, from £2.7trillion the previous month. The Bank's Inflation Report tomorrow will show lenders are getting more confident about the strength of the economy. It will also show that inflation, which has surged to its highest level in four years, is expected to fall back to its target of 2 per cent next week. It will also show that mortgage approvals in the third quarter of this year rose strongly - to 9"

291,"How Fox News misled viewers about the coronavirus case in Flint, Michigan A CBS News investigation finds that the network used a news report to put a false claim on the Flint water crisis. The report showed that some residents of Flint, Michigan, used the city's water supply for decades without telling the truth. The reporter also told viewers that residents of Flint -- who included the city's chief medical officer -- had been exposed to lead from pipes used to treat Legionnaire's disease. CBS News correspondent Julianna Goldman and chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook report. The report, ""Flint's Water Crisis: How a Doctor Accused of Abuse and Misconduct Caused a Colony,"" ran from April 9 through July 12, 2014. It contained an interview with Flint Mayor Karen Weaver. Dr. Weaver said she believed her actions were justified. ""I had no reason to doubt Dr. Weaver's credibility,"" she said in a statement. I am sorry that I did not know that the Flint water crisis was serious enough to warrant greater regulation of the water supply. The report also found that the city's water system had been properly tested in the lead-contaminated water in Flint. ""The city's water system was, and remains, fully compliant with federal regulations,"" the report says. The network claims it was ""accurate and truthful information"" from Weaver. The report says that the network ""used aggressive language"" and that the reporter used a news item about the Flint water crisis to mislead viewers. The station claimed the coverage was biased and flawed. CBS News' senior health and medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook and CBS News Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton speak with Dr. Jennifer Ashton about the report.

292,"AT & T tells employees to work from home or go on leave NEW YORK (Reuters) - AT & T Inc said on Monday that it would give its 17,000 employees a break during the school year if they were working from home, and to limit their work hours to only two days a week. The move is part of a plan to make the company more competitive, Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said at a news conference. The company said it would no longer negotiate contracts with companies that have more than 50 employees, cutting salaries for current employees by 17 percent. Stephenson said that, if the move goes ahead, he will seek to close the company's data centers. It's nothing to do with the data centers. It's business that we are in, ""he said. This is a business that we want to be a part of. The change in plan also follows AT & T's announcement last month that it would close some data centers after about a year and lay off several others. Stephenson also detailed plans to reorganize the company's workforce. The company said it would lower the number of its U.S. employees from the current 103,000 to about 85,000, while maintaining the number of U.S. employees who are technically employed abroad. Stephenson said the company would have no employee turnover this year, and that the move would save the company $500 million to $600 million annually. Stephenson declined to specify a cost to the company, but said it would be in the range of $500 million to $800 million. AT & T shares have declined about 10 percent since the start of the year. It has also said it would keep the benefits of government subsidies available to the telecommunications company. The plan was unveiled during a conference call with analysts on Monday. Reporting by Sinead Carew and Jennifer Saba; Editing by Gary Hill, Bernard Orr and John Wallace. This story corrects that AT & T's annual report was released on January 9, 2010. It has been corrected to show that the company is reorganizing its workforce in various scenarios. It should show that the company will have more than 50 employees in 2018, not that it will have more than 50 employees.

293,"Cybercriminals are trying to cash in on the coronavirus, experts warn It has been a tough year for the research. A global outbreak of the virus caused the deaths of at least 100 people worldwide, which also led to new efforts to catch the virus. It has also led to two major revisions in the way scientific techniques are applied in the field. To find out more about the effectiveness of this new virus, watch BBC News 24's Cybercrime podcast, which is available now. This podcast runs until later in the month. If you hear any of the episodes above, you can hear from people who have been affected by the virus, including: Roxanne Wexler Roxanne Wexler is the executive director of the Cyber Security Initiative at the Cyber Policy Institute at Stanford University. She told the Today programme that the cybercriminals are trying to exploit the virus and steal data. ""You can go into a company and you'll get something that's not very legitimate and you can steal the code or something, and that's what they're doing,"" she said. Once the code is out there, they'll have a big financial stake. They're trying to take data from that company and actually harvest it. The cybercriminals are also trying to steal trade secrets. ""The people who are stealing the code are selling that information to others on the internet and sending it to these other people,"" said Ms Wexler. One of the most common methods of stealing trade secrets is to buy products from independent sellers, she explained. ""There are some really good websites that are selling the goods, and you really can make a lot of money with them,"" she said. The best way to prevent the spread of the virus is to stay within a one-mile radius of your home, if possible. If you are worried about your home security, Ms Wexler suggested having a secure containment area. ""If a lot of the windows are open, it's a little easier to look in this area,"" she said. What you can do is call up the company and tell them about the problem and report it and they can fix that. It's so easy to steal trade secrets. [The virus] seems to have taken many, many people by surprise. I've seen a lot of people who've had problems with their security being stolen and sold. I can personally see it and I can tell people I had it."
294,"How McDonald's made the switch to fresh beef Earlier this month it became the first fast-food company to offer beef burgers made from cows raised in cattle raised in UK abattoirs and then shot in the abattoir. McDonald's will take on a significant proportion of the business, and is hoping this will see it expand the range of its beef burgers. ""We are investing heavily in new products, and we're investing heavily in offering our customers more choice,"" said Gordon Booth, McDonald's global director of business development. McDonald's added that it needed to work on what it calls ""more sophisticated"" menu items. The beef burgers will go on sale in the US in the new year but McDonald's will continue to sell it in the UK. The company is also trying to expand into Asia, where it has a presence. It has said it plans to open 13 restaurants in the region by the end of 2017. The company has also promised to invest £10m in its domestic operations in the UK, which will lead to over 1,000 new jobs. McDonald's said it would also be investing in its UK network of more than 1,000 branches. According to the company, the new restaurants will open in the first half of 2018. Steve Easterbrook, executive vice president of McDonald's in the UK, said: ""We have seen a huge increase in demand for our ingredients. The introduction of the first McRib and the launch of the McRib Dinner were critical steps to further reshape the fast food industry and we're excited to deliver these and other new McRib products as part of our commitment to offering our customers even more choice. The introduction of the new McRib Dinner was a labour of love for our customers and we're looking forward to building on that success. McDonald's has also secured a £450m contract to supply beef to its European suppliers. The move could be used to reduce costs, which could include job losses. McDonald's has been in the vanguard of a change to the US food industry in recent years, and last year it announced a programme to slash the amount of meat it consumes by 90%. This is a year the chain has already announced a new menu, including a Big Mac, chicken cheeseburgers and McDouble. However, the new menu will not be available to the public, and will instead be available via the company's website. It is currently available in three stores in the UK: Birmingham,"

The blockchain - a digital ledger maintained by a network of computers that can track the movement of any asset without the need for a central regulator - has seen a massive increase in value. The price of Bitcoin has fallen more than 25% this week, from $6,744 (£4,784) at its peak last July to $14,300 this Wednesday.

This is the last chance for a crypto rally in 2018 Bitcoin's biggest collapse in history in July has led to speculation it will see a wave of new cryptocurrencies. But experts have warned that the cryptocurrency's volatility and the fact it has barely been valued is a major concern. Bitcoin is not a bubble. It is a very volatile cryptocurrency, ""a UK-based equity strategist told the BBC. But even if it is a bubble, there is always a chance it will find a new home as the price has more than trebled over the last few months. He said the last bubble, so far, had been a"" perfectly normal ""time for the crypto market in 2017. However, it has now been"" quite fragmented. ""Bitcoin is essentially a private cryptocurrency which is held in a"" wallet ""but which is not fully secured throughout the world. Bitcoin has a market value of $780m but is based on a volatile index of every coin which is adjusted for inflation. It has fallen by more than $600 in value this week, from $8,000 at its peak in July."
296,"Online sales of hand sanitizer and other 'virus protectors' spiked over 800% this year in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rise has led to more than 70,000 US cases of the illness in hospitals since January. Dr Besser's segment also features a preview of another outbreak, this time linked to an outbreak of a deadly new strain of bird flu in China. The virus is highly pathogenic and has killed nearly 730 people, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). It's likely to have contributed to the current outbreak in China, where two outbreaks were detected in a poultry market and another killed 49. The bird flu outbreak is blamed on the H7N9 bird flu virus, which infects people from certain strains of the virus. It has made it difficult for any country to track it, making it impossible to conduct regular inspections. H7N9 bird flu is not considered a threat to humans, but is a complication of the flu, meaning it is difficult for countries to conduct regular inspections. Last month, The World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the virus is likely to mutate rapidly and spread very quickly. The WHO has said this mutation can lead to a very severe form, known as novel influenza A, which leads to a pandemic. Earlier this year, the WHO announced it was activating its emergency response system in 24 countries. For more ways you can protect yourself visit the CDC's website.

298,"US airlines will continue their European flights for another week at least, after talks to end the industrial action. The US airline industry group Airlines for America said it was seeking to halt the stoppage next week in a bid to ""preserve jobs and service"" in the event of a new contract being signed with the striking pilots. However, a group representing other carriers said it had not been approached to offer concessions including pay rises, benefits and retirement benefits. It added that it was clear there was a lack of goodwill by the industry following the announcement, which is expected to go ahead on April 5. The US air industry has been seeking a new contract with the management of American Airlines. The Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), which represents more than 260,000 pilots, said it was ""disappointed"" by the news. The US companies said earlier in the day that they had agreed to a deal worth up to $3.2bn (£2.7bn), with a further $360m to come from bonuses. The company added that it would continue to offer extra flights to and from other European cities. The airline industry unions said they were disappointed with the action, but expressed hope that the recent talks had led to a deal. ""We hope that this deal reflects the fact that unions are going to be able to bring their concerns back to the negotiating table,"" said APFA President Chris Mainz. After years of working together against each other, the airlines have come to the table to work together and to gain a better contract. The US airline industry has been hit by flight delays and cancellations for several months, particularly in the US. Earlier on Wednesday, Delta, American and United Airlines called off a planned strike at the end of April, saying they were ""unable to reach the new contract, with the airline still proposing the same benefits and benefits."" The airlines and the union have been meeting since June, but the talks broke down after the two sides failed to reach agreement. The US airline industry is facing a recession and falling passenger numbers, with passenger traffic falling in the last quarter of 2008, according to the International Air Transport Association. © Copyright Press Association Ltd 2008, All Rights Reserved. plc..

299,"Walt Disney World closes, paralyzing the company's tourism empire Disneyland's Walt Disney World resort will close on Sunday, amid a deepening crisis over its handling of a 2014 wildfire that destroyed the park and injured dozens of people, the company said in an announcement late Saturday. The closure of the theme park's main attraction will not affect the impact of the Walt Disney World-branded resort, however, it will put more than 230 employees on leave or leave their jobs, the company said. The closure comes on the same day that the parks company announced a ""major operational and financial restructuring"" of the company, with more than $2 billion in planned savings. The Walt Disney Co. is also under scrutiny by the U.S. Department of Justice for its handling of a deadly wildfire at Disneyland in 2016. The fire was caused when a firetruck failed to stop when it was flagged down by a fire truck for a rollover on the edge of the park. The Disneyland Resort is the second-largest employer in Los Angeles County, with more than 300,000 employees. Disney officials said two of the park's supertankers, which power ride rides for riders, were being moved to its new location. The ride is expected to be fully operational Monday. The largest of those rides, the Escape to the Ozarks, was expected to reopen Wednesday. There was no indication Saturday morning of when the Escape would be fully reopened. The fire had destroyed two of the park's four cabins, including a portion of the Sea of Ourimbah ride, the company said. A third cabin, the Water Mule ride, was still spinning at 220 mph Saturday morning, it said. The fire also paralyzed the park's water feature, which handles rides that include a drop into the lake and a water slides. The fire also forced the temporary closure of the Water Mule ride. The park, which was built in 1943, was designed by Walt Disney. It opened in 1952. There have been more than a dozen fatal incidents at Disneyland during the summer, including an accident that left two people dead in 2016. The park was reopened May 19 after a $5.5 billion renovation. Disney closed its first California Adventure Park in 1998 as part of a $4 billion renovation of the resort. All 12 scheduled rides were shut down in May 2017."

In a statement, the two-week cruise on the Princess and Viking set out from Southampton on Wednesday and Friday to the Mediterranean. The cruise line said all its ships would cease all cruises on Thursday. It is being urged to cover guests with masks and use ""all appropriate hand sanitisers"" and ""hygiene kits"" to avoid contact with the voyagers. On Wednesday, the ship was the subject of a medical evacuation. The outbreak has been a severe blow to the cruise industry. Most cruise lines have been fined for the virus since the outbreak was first identified in August. Princess Cruises, which has not yet confirmed the cause of the outbreak, said that it had advised passengers to follow CDC guidelines. ""The risk to our guests and crew is very minimal,"" said John Carlile, the company's chief executive. By withdrawing from cruises through Thursday, we have taken every precaution possible to control the situation and minimise the impact on our guests and crew. Symptoms of the virus include vomiting and diarrhoea, some people develop severe stomach cramps or vomiting and vomiting diarrhoea. Anyone who has been in close contact with loved ones is being offered medical help. The ships' websites have been discontinued and all of the ship's destinations have been closely monitored. The cruise line said it was ""closely monitoring the situation"" and would be offering hotel rooms but that ""all guests who are currently in the UK should postpone their trip until we can be assured that we have been treating the issue with the utmost seriousness."" It said passengers who did not wish to remain on the ship were due to contact individual hotels via their travel agent and an emergency contact line. The Royal Caribbean International cruise line also cancelled its voyages to the same Caribbean island as the outbreak, following advice from the UK's Health Protection Agency. The Viking was due to return in February to port at Sal Salis in Spain. The five-day cruise, which cost from £1,299, departed Southampton on May 21, 2017.

Take a step back and think about what it's like to be constantly in front of the computer. Get your family to take a break, or just stretch out of it? If you're doing something you're not comfortable with, ask yourself, ""What just happened?"" It might be the Internet, or a business meeting, or a family day out. This is where you can improve your productivity. And just remember to tell all the family members about your day off. Get them to take a few minutes of your time. Don't do it too often. If you do, you'll lose all of that time. If you do it too often, you'll leave behind a small window of time for the other family members to take a break to get to know you better.

The second Big Mac is actually that new classic that has been in regular stock for four years. The original Big Mac was first introduced in 1971. It has been in regular stock since 1977 through a series of changes that took less than a year to create. A new version of the original Big Mac is being introduced which costs a mere £1.

McDonald's has been partnering with a number of global brands, and is especially excited to see the scent being sold in Australia from 1 November. The fast food chain is partnering with an Australian company called The Champaign Co, which is responsible for the scent based on the Champaign brand.

307,"Dunkin 'has a plan for better coffee on the menu Dunkin' Donuts has a plan to make its coffee more affordable, the company announced Thursday. The chain has started experimenting with using a single cup of coffee to make its own version of the popular donut. The new coffee is a different one, called the Mocha, and still contains its old-fashioned cream, but Dunkin 'Donuts is using the new ""Mocha."" The new Mocha has a light, fresh flavor and has a similar sweet taste. The new Mocha is being introduced in stores later this month. The company says that the coffee will cost 75 cents per cup, compared to $1.70 for regular coffee. Dunkin' Donuts is rolling out the new Mocha in two additional stores, in Atlanta and Las Vegas, in the first quarter of next year. The company also has plans for other coffee-flavored products, including coffee-flavored milk and iced tea for coffee-lovers. The chain is also offering a coffee called the Double Down that features the chain's signature chocolate fudge cake. ""Dunkin"" Donuts is always trying new and exciting ingredients and has learned a great deal about how coffee is made, ""said Amy Lowe, executive vice president of Dunkin 'Donuts, in a statement.

308,"What is a bear market? After big swings in US stocks, investors have been left red faced over what to expect when the economy recovers. Traders have reacted to last week's decision by the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates from their record low of near zero. They are worried financial markets will start to look more like the 1930s, with fears of a potential crash, a severe recession and rising interest rates. Analysis by Graham Tibbetts of S & P Global Market Intelligence has shown one of the main areas of concern is slowdown in China. The country's official statistics bureau reported industrial output fell by 14.6% in February, compared with the same month last year. S & P Global warned that if the latest industrial production figures were confirmed, ""we think the Chinese economy may have experienced a serious slowdown in the second quarter of 2013."" ""Market participants are taking these concerns into account,"" it said. The drop in industrial production and the increase in production prices will probably have more to do with the effects of the downturn in China than any slowdown in the US. On the streets of Beijing, traders are already looking ahead to next week's second quarter GDP data. ""It will be interesting to see the impact of the rebound in China,"" says Jim Walker, a strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank. ""That will have a bigger effect on growth than the slowdown in the US,"" he says. China will release its official figures on Friday, which will be closely watched by investors. Standard Chartered economists said the government would probably keep the official figure for the second quarter of the year below the key 7.5% forecast, but could still bring in a rise to 7.5%. The Chinese GDP growth has been underpinned by better-than-expected bank lending and government subsidies. However, while China's economy is growing at a faster pace than its Asian neighbours, the country's growth has been below potential. ""The situation in China will not necessarily reflect the real economy fundamentals,"" says Mr Walker. I don't think the underlying trend is to the same extent as the US, although it might be more of a cyclical slowdown. But the economy will grow because it is growing more strongly. All eyes are on the next round of US Fed rate increases. ""The markets are expecting an increase at the end of the year, and we are expecting that in 2014,"" says Mr Walker."

Now, Channel 5 is looking for a new boss to bring in more attention to the programme. A spokesman for the channel said that the programme ""has no plans to change anything."" The programme is a celebration of modern technology, like the time-lapse cameras used by the BBC. It follows on from the success of Big Brother, which saw it become a global hit in 2012. Producers say that it is helping them to stay ahead of the competition. The new director of programme development, Alex McKenna, is an executive from the University of Kent. He previously worked at BBC Worldwide. He said: ""We don't have any plans to move away from the format. We are a channel that is interested in innovating and innovating with new technology. In the UK, there is still a lot of work to do on technology. We need to make sure that we use it wisely and efficiently and that we don't lose sight of the bigger picture. So we need to make sure that we are prepared for the next wave of technology in the UK. Channel 5's chief executive, Chris Patten, said the programme's success"" will enable us to grow our audience and keep up with the changing landscape in television. ""He said:"" I am delighted to welcome Alex to Channel 5, who will be bringing a wealth of experience to our flagship new programme.

He is likely to take up the position in the autumn. Channel 5 is currently screening Big Brother 2, a documentary which follows the lives of 22 contestants from all over the world. The series, which will be shown on Channel 5 on Sundays, is set to air on Channel 5 at 9pm on Monday."
310,"How a coronavirus' infodemic 'is infecting the internet from Africa The virus has been known to cause the death of hundreds of people and has a devastating effect on humanity. The first documented case was in 2008 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, as epidemiologists said it was first identified in an outbreak in the central African nation of Uganda. Despite the high death toll, the outbreak has now been contained, and the WHO is continuing to monitor the situation. It is thought that the coronavirus, which causes cold sores on the nose, nose and throat, has spread in the United States from the states of Minnesota and Pennsylvania. However, so far, it has not been identified in all countries. Since its discovery, new cases have been reported in Uganda, in Sierra Leone, in Kenya, and in Saudi Arabia. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has said that there were more than 37,000 confirmed cases of the virus around the world. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has been collecting samples from the affected countries to test for the virus, but it is not known how many people have been infected. Dr David Heymann, an infectious diseases expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the virus was ""inducable"" into the global population through contact with infected people. ""There's no reason to think that it's out there,"" he said. Experts have warned that the virus, which is transmitted through bats, flies and other human blood-sucking animals, may have the potential to be transmitted by mosquitoes and other insects. US officials have called for a mosquito-eradication programme in Africa, but experts have questioned whether this would help prevent the disease spreading. The spread of the virus, including through the sharing of saliva, could also be related to the spread of the common cold. It is unclear how the virus infected those who appeared to have been infected, and if anyone has been infected. Dr Heymann said: ""If you are infected with a virus they can transmit it to others."" However, he added: ""If you are infected in the United States, it may be possible to transmit it to someone living in the state of Utah or Alabama."" The virus could also be passed from mammals to humans through contact with infected animals, he added."
311,"The 'retail apocalypse,' explained Cordell on Twitter.'We are now at a point where we just can't even begin to prepare for a CTM conversion. 'Apple has been working hard on its own plan amid concern that being overtaken by Amazon with a newly launched product could create a powerful competitor to the California company's vast store base. The tech giant has already said it could launch another two successful subscription services - one for the iPhone and the other for Apple TV. The launch of the new Apple TV has sparked speculation that Apple is holding onto the' Planet of the Apps' title for at least a few more quarters. But is that a stretch? Apple's next major endeavor is the unveiling of its latest iPhone. Apple didn't initially announce the device, named the iPhone 5S, until October. But it has since gone on sale, with the iPhone 5S and 5C boasting big screen sizes. But many fans have expressed their disbelief over the new iPhone X, with some wondering whether Apple is simply hoping to overtake the smartphone market, which has seen an explosion of devices that use the iPhone X every year. And although Apple hasn't said much about the new device, many suspected it would be called the iPhone X and that the new device could be called the iPhone X Plus. Some also pointed out that Apple's next big step will likely be the iPhone X - which is currently being tipped as the iPhone X, but will have a 10.5-inch screen instead of the 9.7-inch device's current 9.7-inch screen. There have been numerous reports that the next iteration of the iPhone will be called the iPhone X, and that Apple may release a cheaper smartphone. Speaking to Bloomberg, Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi said the new phone will have 'more of an edge-to-edge screen' than the current iPhone, and will be a 'full-color screen.' The new phone will also feature an 'edge-to-edge display' that will be at least 10% larger than previous generations, according to Apple Insider. The phone will feature a new home button for the first time, and the antenna will be made of plastic. Calling it the iPhone X, he also revealed that it will be equipped with facial recognition technology - similar to the design that helped Apple unlock the iPhone X in the past. Earlier this week, Apple revealed all about its new smartphone, which is set to be released"
312,"The best ways to get yourself hired has been revealed in a new book that could guide you through the job hunt and hone your CV. The guide to getting the right job sees career experts reveal how to get the right one - and it's a no-brainer. According to MBA's website, 'A skilled worker with a good work ethic, an ability to work hard, and a high level of communication skills are the go-to employees for successful job interviews'. However, it does show how to get hired. The site outlines four steps you can take to get hired - starting with learning how to apply for a job, then getting a good CV. If you've got a good CV you need to be organised in advance, according to MBA's website, so your application should be ready in advance. Make sure you know when to apply, give everything a try and read the role descriptions first to get a feel for your ability. The website also suggests talking to potential employers about the type of job you want, so you can understand their expectations before you can ask for a job, particularly if you have a family member working in the industry. The second step is ensuring the interview is a 'two-hour, one-size-fits-all job'. Don't miss: It can take several hours to get an interview, and you may need to speak to a recruiter in advance, to give it time to get a feel for your skills Avoid the hiring process by reading the job descriptions yourself, as you can be much more confident in what you're doing. Also, it may take a few hours to get a job (or two) as everyone in the interview process will be giving you lots of information. However, you can get a better deal by speaking to your potential employer directly - and talk to the recruiter about the reasons why they're hiring you. The following are the things you can do to make sure you get the job you want. How much you should ask for £50,000 less than you're offered for a job Apply for a job with a high salary, but don't expect it to have the same pay and benefits. Pay £50,000 less than you're offered for a job with a higher pay and benefits. Introduce a 'senior level salary' and sign a statutory declaration with the job title. This means the job should be advertised with less hoopla and more value for money."

314,"5 things to know about the payroll tax cut bill House Republicans have said they want to give the president a chance to negotiate a new revenue-neutral tax cut that would deliver a 2 percentage point boost to the federal budget. But the Republican-led Senate has a deadline of midnight on Monday to break a tie, or the deal could collapse. That's why we've been here. Here are five things to know about the payroll tax cut. The payroll tax cut for 160 million Americans is due to expire at the end of the year and the GOP wants to extend the law for another year. The House GOP's bill would repeal it but cut it by about $1.7 trillion for the year, shaving $2.5 trillion from the deficit over the next decade. As a GOP-led Senate, the bill would be paid for using the savings in the debt ceiling, which the GOP refused to act on. Democrats say the bill would do a better job of addressing long-term deficits, while Republicans counter that it would raise the debt ceiling by more than $1 trillion over the next decade. Democrats have accused Republicans of trying to negotiate a deal that would kill the measure. With this bill passing the House this afternoon, the Senate will return to Washington, where the GOP will be in a lame duck session until next week for its annual retreat. Senate Republicans hope to pass the bill Friday. It also calls for a one-year extension of the Social Security tax cut, which would be added to the bill after the president's signature. The House bill would also add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. The House would extend it for two years and the Senate would implement it one year. Senate Democrats control the House with 53 seats. Democrats hope to take over the Senate in January after that. Once a deal is reached, the Senate would have to pass the Senate version and send it to Obama for his signature. If a Senate bill is passed, the Senate would have to vote on the House version and send it back to Obama. If the Senate has a deal that does not include the House bill, the Senate could pass it this week to avoid a shutdown. Republicans have been pushing for an extension, but Democrats have balked at the idea just to provide time for negotiations on the new legislation.

But by the Monday morning, it was clear that we had a lot of work to do. We had the first day of the week off. We were starting to get some back-to-work stress. At the office, we were having a little hard time. Many people were asking me whether my company would be next to the fire and rescue department. We've been here for a month. It's been a little hard to get through this week. I had a colleague who was recently diagnosed with coronavirus and was being monitored. She was in the office for four days. She asked me if she could come pick me up. She didn't want me to be worried. As I was getting the results of her blood tests, she asked if she could bring me all her mail. I had no idea what she was getting. I went to the computer. I hadn't seen her at work in quite a while. I think she was really nervous because she was so young. We all have our own sick days. We all have to take a few days off. I don't think that's what I'm worried about. What are you worried about? Are you worried that this is a widespread disease? What are the odds of its spreading? Would it make me feel worse? I would think so. I'm not sure yet if this is the kind of exposure that I should be worried about, but it's a concern. Is that something that people should know? I think it's a lot more serious, than I'd like to think. The worst thing you can do to yourself is to have a bad day. If you get sick at work, get sick. If you get sick at home, don't go in the office. It's a horrible feeling. We all have our own problems. If you're still feeling nauseous, that's OK. If you get sick at home, you don't go in the office. So, we've all got to follow the advice of our colleagues. Stay healthy and stay away from the office. Everyone has a different approach to their symptoms. We're all just trying to make it more manageable. We're not at the point yet where we can use a computer, but we're working on it."

Rather than allowing the internet to be a place where anyone with an interest can be easily tracked or tracked, there needs to be a more open society where people with learning disabilities can be involved in learning. The website will be available outside of Minecraft's US home page and, like other sites, will include exclusive content, including a video chat available to people with disabilities. Mr Howe said that the UK had a tradition of allowing people to share their own experiences with miners in the organisation. ""Minecraft is available to anyone who wants to share their own private or confidential experiences with miners in Britain,"" he added. I'm confident that as the new site grows we will be far more open to having more people share their own stories, and understanding how the world works through words and the real world. Minecraft was launched with the intention of encouraging users to upload their own work to the web, which is intended to assist other content creators. It has now been downloaded more than 146 million times and has become popular with people with learning disabilities and the disabled. The UK website will link to the Minecraft website, called Minecraft UK, as well as other Minecraft sites, and will be available in all major UK cities. The website will join other web pages including Twitter, Reddit, Instagram and YouTube. Minecraft is available to people with disabilities already through the Minecraft website. It is free and available on the web. Many people with disabilities use the Minecraft web site to play video games and the site will soon be accessible in all major UK cities. Minecraft has also had support from the British Paralympic Association, which will be launching a £5m fund to provide support and help for people with disabilities. The scheme, which has been backed by the British government and the European Commission, is being run by the European Commission. Minecraft is available to stream on the web, on mobile phones and on the PC, Sony and Samsung and Mac computers. The video game is an internet-enabled version of the Minecraft game, which was launched in 1975 by Markus Persson. The company has since sold more than 60 million copies."

Apple also announced a new smartwatch, the Apple Watch, and a new version of the iPad. Apple introduced the first smartwatch in 2013 and the Apple Watch came with iOS 11, which allowed users to access Apple's software 24 hours a day from default. In June, Apple announced it would bring its iTunes software to iPad users and release an update to iOS 9.3, the next version of the OS. Apple has also introduced a new new iOS operating system, OS X, that will be available from 3 November. Like its predecessor, OS X will have two new features. It will allow users to download apps into their mobile phones at a rate for four days, or faster and will be able to do so for 99% of the time. The first new OS will be available on the iPhone and iPod touch, as well as Macs and iPads. A month after Apple said it had taken 9bn pre-orders, it was reported that it had signed an exclusive agreement with the makers of the iPhone 5c, including Apple, to ship it to the US market. Rumours of the new MacBook Air and the iPad Mini have already been circulating online. The company is expected to issue a statement today, but it is unclear if the announcement is related to the iCloud update. What do you think of Apple's WWDC? Will you be at the event?

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday announced a revision of a five-year contract awarded in 2014 to sell information to Microsoft that was critical to the US government's efforts to combat cyber warfare. ""[The] Department is committed to continuing to develop and modernize Microsoft's critical information technology solutions to ensure that this critical information is always available to the public,"" Mattis said in a statement. In addition, the Department is working with Microsoft on a major project to develop and update Microsoft products for the cloud. Microsoft, which has been working to address the concerns of member firms, sued the Pentagon last year over the contract. The company described the lawsuit as ""without merit"" and said the government had ""engaged in a pattern and practice of aggressively violating its members' privacy."" It accused the Department of Defense of making a ""misleading, false and misleading claim"" that the contract did not include ""adequate protections for the confidentiality of its users."" It said that Microsoft's proposal to provide ""critical information"" to the National Security Agency would ""place the public at risk."" The revision comes a day after Mattis also made a major announcement about the US military's plans to overhaul its troubled ""war on terror"" drone program. Mattis also ordered the Pentagon to ""implement radical new rules"" in an effort to streamline the way the military functions. ""Our military is well-equipped to defend the nation and enforce the law,"" Mattis said. The new rules will ensure that military personnel, including contractors and civilians, have the information they need to stay safe on the battlefield. These rules will ensure that we are better equipped to meet the mission of our mission. Mattis' statement said the new rules would also ensure that the military will have ""fewer tools to fight crime, train our military to operate effectively and respond rapidly to threats."" The US military had already completed a comprehensive review of its ""war on terror"" drone pilot program, according to Mattis' statement. The review examined guidelines for the way the military works to address issues arising from drone strikes, including its decision to revoke a five-year contract for the unmanned aircraft."

322,"NBA suspending its season is a serious blow to its TV partners, with ESPN, Fox and others showing their hand in the dispute. All three television networks have been trying to reach an agreement in the best interests of their existing deals. ""These are serious questions for the league and the players,"" Stern told the union. We need to get back to business as usual. The league said the league would not return to the negotiating table unless the sides settled their contracts and signed a new collective bargaining agreement. Even if players walk off the job, there is no guarantee their contracts will be renewed, which the union said could take as long as 12 months to negotiate. ""There is a good chance that the lockout will be extended and canceled by a full season,"" said Stern, who also urged the owners to approve a new collective bargaining agreement before the current one expires on Nov. A lockout would give the league 11 days of work to complete before the 2011-12 season. The NBPA wants to add a three-team playoff system, and owners want to add a longer one-season schedule. ""As a result of the uncertainty that this impasse has created, we remain prepared to work constructively with the union and to avoid a lockout,"" NBA spokesman Mike Bass said in a statement. In addition, the NBPA is committed to meeting our obligation to our players and to working with the union to reach a solution that is in the best interests of our league. The union has been negotiating with the players union since June in a bid to get them to accept a new agreement in their contract. Without an agreement, the NBA is scheduled to begin its regular season just three days before the first game of the 2010-11 season. The two sides have been unable to reach an agreement since July 31. ""The unions have a real, real chance to help the players, who are having a hard time,"" said Stern, who has been working with the players union since 2000. At this point it remains unclear what the ultimate outcome of this dispute will be, both sides believe, and the whole thing is in jeopardy.

323,"How NASA's Apollo program kicked off Silicon Valley's tech revolution The moon landing of July 1969 was a turning point. The days of American superiority in space were numbered. To many Americans, 1969 marked the beginning of a new era. For decades, the Apollo landing was viewed as a triumph of American colonial power. But not to this day. The Apollo program kicked off a wave of technological innovation that transformed the fields of business and technology. Many companies, such as Google, are now privately owned. It was Silicon Valley that helped shape the start-up scene in the 1970s. The first commercial space shuttle landed on the Moon. ""I think we were the first to realize that the kind of technological revolution we were seeing in the early years was not going to be a product of the Pentagon,"" says Joe Clark, who co-founded Jelly Beans. With the advent of the Internet, the U.S. military was looking to deploy military satellites to orbit. The Soviet Union had already sent a satellite into space. Most of the technological advances of that era took place in the United States. For Clark, who founded the company Jelly Beans in 1970, the Apollo program was the first real breakthrough. This was not about the Apollo program, it was about the way our country was going to change. Now, Clark says, people are looking for a new role for the Apollo program. The program will help open up opportunities, while continuing to invest in science and technology. ""The Apollo program has the potential to transform the way we think about space and space and to be part of that discussion,"" Clark says. Clark says he's not worried about where the program will go next. He says he hopes it will be a place where Americans can meet and work and make new and exciting contributions. ""It's not about getting a new job, it's about getting back on the same page,"" Clark says. We're all looking to be part of something bigger. The program marks the completion of a five-year design process. Clark says the goal is to take the Apollo program to the next level. The astronauts will travel at least one billion miles around the moon and back to Earth. The mission is planned for 2024. Click for more from FoxNews.com. Click for more from The Wall Street Journal.

324,"Jeff Bezos just sold $1.8 billion worth of Amazon stock. Here's why the market should be nervous. Here's the thing: A lot of people have been talking about Amazon's stock price since it went public (it traded above $1,500 for the first time Wednesday). That is, after a two-day rally, it's now worth about $206.7 billion, more than twice what it's just reached. But could Amazon be about to go on a big bubble? If there's one thing that's likely to change in this bull market, it's that the tech industry has barely been paying attention. And while companies spend billions on research and development, they're the ones who spend the most. What's more, when companies spend money, they're the ones who make the most money. So here's a more fundamental reason. How much does the stock market really devalue? And if the market is going to go up, it's going to make it harder for the tech sector to make money. The tech sector's profits and valuations have been on a tear in recent years, with the S & P 500 up more than 70 percent since 2010, while the Nasdaq has more than doubled. But this year, there's a growing number of tech companies that are also going public. Last year, the Nasdaq was down 7.3 percent, the S & P 500 was down 2.4 percent, and Apple's stock was down 16 percent. Amazon was up more than 9 percent the day after the market's close, most of which was due to the company's earnings report. Amazon is also a huge consumer of gadgets; its revenue from every purchase is a huge amount of money. But its quarterly earnings were on a par with those of its competitors, and it reported another impressive quarter. That's also a sign that the tech sector is feeling more confident since Amazon's stock jumped to $1,745. That's a huge amount of money for a company that is so dependent on online sales for revenue. The time has come for tech companies to be more cautious about investing heavily in the future, and for tech companies to be more cautious with that investment. Tech companies shouldn't be investing in any tech stocks just yet. That requires buying them with far more wiggle room. But that's not a bad time to be diversified, diversified.

325,"Bill Nye's experimental spacecraft that sails on sunlight declares mission success In its first major test, the Advanced Exploration Systems (EELS) spacecraft, which has been designed and built by scientists at the University of Hawaii, flew into space for just five minutes on Saturday. But the team behind the project have revealed its new breakthrough - and it was achieved thanks to a little help from the sunlight itself. The University of Hawaii team, which was led by Kevin Hart, has worked with Nasa and the International Space Station for the past two years in creating experimental spacecraft to explore the Earth's magnetic field. The high-flying spacecraft, which will travel out of Hawaii and explore the solar system, is expected to reach its target on March 29. It was launched in 2011, after a year of testing. EELS engineers, who have spent the past 15 months in Ukiah, have put together a number of experiments which have resulted in three different results. So far, the sun has covered most of the sun's surface, but has not been directly affected by solar material. But the sun has been at its most powerful - for more than two billion years - when it is in the middle of its maximum activity. The solar wind - which speeds up the particles in the sun's atmosphere - is thought to give off light as it passes through Earth's atmosphere. EELS spacecraft has been developed with contributions from the US government, Nasa and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), which is also behind the project. The team say they are now looking to the International Space Station to learn more about how EELS works. ""Using a natural source of sunlight, EELS will collect data from the sun's atmosphere to study how the solar wind affects Earth's magnetic field,"" said Mr Hart. This will inform new research in the future on how solar wind affects Earth's magnetic field and provide another tool for understanding how it changes. The spacecraft will be launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It will stay in orbit for another five days before successfully returning to Earth. At that time, it will provide important clues about how the solar wind affects the solar wind. If the mission works, the payload will be able to take measurements of the sun's magnetic fields as it will pass overhead, according to the Nasa"
326,"SpaceX's massive Starship prototype lifts off from Cape Canaveral SpaceX successfully lifted off from Cape Canaveral on Friday, marking another milestone for the company's Falcon 9 rocket, which has been touted as a more fuel-efficient alternative to the Boeing 747 jet. When the SpaceX Dragon and Falcon 9 first landed last month at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, it was hailed as a major step forward for the company to get its own spacecraft to orbit again and launch astronauts into deep space. The Dragon is also expected to return to Earth in 2018. ""We're excited to begin our mission,"" founder Elon Musk said in a statement at SpaceX's launch facility, at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. It's a giant leap forward for us, and we're proud to be a part of this historic day. In a statement, NASA flight director Kathleen Kennedy said, ""This Dragon is a historic moment to see an unmanned payload landing on an ocean platform."" The Falcon 9 rocket has been under development since late 2016, but the company has repeatedly delayed the launch of its first flight to the International Space Station (ISS), as well as other destinations. A test flight in 2017 went as planned, but it came down last month. Because of the delay, SpaceX had to cancel the launch, but later on Friday, it said it was just fine and the company was back on schedule. Earlier this week, Musk tweeted that Musk had finally reached his goal of landing a rocket on Mars. ""The first successful launch from a SpaceX Falcon 9 mission to Mars,"" Musk tweeted. Now it's time to get to work on the most difficult part of the rocket industry (and) get ready to make our flights to Mars. Related: SpaceX to launch its next rocket with a Dragon A Falcon 9 rocket launch could be in the works in 2020, according to several industry experts. It would be the first flight for SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets, and the first time it's being flown on a regular rocket. The company also has flown a Dragon mission to the International Space Station. The company plans to launch a payload again in 2018. CNNMoney (New York) First published May 29, 2018: 3: 54 PM ET SpaceX Dragon launch delayed"

Mr Musk, 40, was speaking at a conference in Munich on Tuesday, where he said that he wants to see robots in agriculture to ensure that they can adapt to ""new situations."" The billionaire said: ""In the future, we want to make our food more efficiently and to improve yield and quality."" He added: ""We want to be self-sufficient in agriculture."" He said he hoped that using robots to make food more easily would be ""a game changer."" Elon Musk is the younger brother of Tesla founder and Tesla boss Elon Musk, and is known for his fierce defence of the company which has faced accusations of dumping toxic heavy metals on peatlands. He also recently criticised Facebook for the amount of time it takes to remove offensive content within the social network, calling it ""a recipe for disaster."" He said the company could save $1 billion a year by eliminating some of the posts and instead make its software more user-friendly. Mr Musk was speaking at the conference alongside fellow co-founder of online payment firm PayPal, Peter Thiel, who called for a ""zero-carbon"" world. Mr Musk also said he ""would be glad to have a Tesla that grows and dies."" He told German newspaper Der Spiegel: ""I think it would have a huge impact on the planet."" The report comes after a Greenpeace activists in the US filed a lawsuit against Tesla for breaching environmental laws. They cited research by the company which found that ""self-sufficiency in the production process is impaired by a significant number of factors in determining the overall environmental impact."" Tesla has said it intends to replace its existing battery-powered vehicles with its self-driving vehicles and, by the end of 2019, it hopes to have a fully autonomous vehicle ready for ride-sharing. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has previously said he would like to see ""the world end in 2023."" Mr Musk is estimated to be worth $45bn. He lives in a £470m house in Florida with his wife Talulah, and their four children."

330,"US clears the way for this self-driving vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals The Trump administration is moving quickly to expedite the automotive industry's permit for a self-driving vehicle. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx is expected to formally certify that the government has completed the permit process for the vehicle, according to two people familiar with the decision. The administration has been working to advance the technology. A study released earlier this year by the Deloitte Group estimates there will be approximately 25,000 self-driving vehicles on roads by 2020, up from 16,000 in 2015. The technology could help revolutionize how auto companies are designing their vehicles in the coming years, to allow them to get around the growing safety challenges of automation. The department has also been working to advance the technology through a $1.5 billion grant program that will allow for 20 percent of the vehicles to be fully retrofitted with new software. That could lead to a faster, more reliable process, including the purchase of the new prototype. The department also has been developing a series of regulations to make sure automakers can get the technology into these vehicles. This is expected to be completed by the end of this month, and should provide the department with more time to develop regulations before the end of 2018. Another round of permits is expected as soon as March. The Department of Transportation could also get around Congress and the Federal Trade Commission, which has been considering guidelines for self-driving cars for years. The department also could be given the authority to require automakers to add new safety features, and to require automakers to put devices in vehicles to stop them from ""crashing."" The technology has been in development for about a decade, but it's still under way. When asked about the process earlier this year, John McAfee, the president of a group called Cybersafe, said he was glad the Trump administration was moving quickly to approve it. ""If the government had gotten it done in a less than two-year time frame, the administration would have been cleared to implement it,"" he said. The Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for vehicle safety, has said it will not allow the self-driving cars. However, the agency is expected to allow the use of the technology in other vehicles. Federal law requires that vehicle manufacturers have to have the technology in their vehicles installed before they could be used by individuals. The Trump administration could not be reached for comment."

Walmart workers in the store's parking lot were so excited they didn't make it in time. They ended up wandering around with the wrong shopping bags while people in the shop were having sex. Some shopkeepers made arrangements to run the underpass instead of running to the pedestrian outside. The natural mother, of some Mormon faith, calmly cheered the customers and gave them her take-home food. But there was no cursing and she doesn't appear to have any problem walking around with her babies in her pram. She looks around and the cardboard boxes begin to plaster her face.'It's not the baby's fault. It's the parents that are just getting carried away with this and that's it.'

I would have given them a little help and they would have been well served, and actually helped us. Instead, the woman left the store but returned with her baby. She bought her baby clothes from the store and left the baby at home to feed the hungry woman. When she first saw the baby she fell for it and called the police. Police arrived at the scene and Kitti was taken away in a van. Kitti's shocked mom has been charged with child cruelty and harassment. Prosecutors said the woman' refused to leave the store without calling the police or using her phone, so she came to get her baby. 'Detectives are now calling her a person of interest in the case.'This is not a random act of child abuse,' a police spokesman said. The woman could face additional charges as a result of the shocking video. It's not clear whether she has retained an attorney. In the video, the woman is seen brazenly walking around the store with a baby in her arms and a toddler in her lap. The woman who posted the video has been identified as 25-year-old Maryam Vader from Edmonton, Canada. She initially claimed she was jogging through the store when she spotted the woman being abused by two different shoppers. She called the emergency services who came to her rescue, suspecting the child had been molested."

334,"BMW redesigns its iconic logo in China SHANGHAI (AP) - BMW AG says it is redesigning its iconic logo to reflect changes in China and is using an online tool to find consumers willing to buy its cars in the country. BMW Group's Shanghai office says the logo, which was created in 1948 and will be updated annually, dates to 1915 and features the world's largest-ever motorized wheels. Chinese shoppers are also expected to be among the first buyers of British luxury sports cars next year. The move comes as BMW tries to regain ground lost to rivals Audi and Mercedes-Benz. It also comes as China's economy has slowed. BMW China vice president Zhang Feng says consumers are being attracted to the brand because it has a well-known customer service record. He says the BMW logo has been a ""great success."" The logo's design will be updated for the Beijing Olympics starting Aug. The Shanghai office says one of the company's redesign jobs will be to ""keep the brand alive and expand the brand's audience."" The BMW brand was created by a group of BMW engineers and design experts. It was launched in Germany by BMW in 1923 and was sold in China and other parts of Asia. The group has since expanded to include other products such as sports car models and luxury cars. It was founded in 1895 as the BMW Group Automobiles. The BMW Group said it will announce the new logo in the next few weeks. The Shanghai office calls the logo a ""natural progression"" in the company's products. It says BMW will have an ""exclusive design partnership"" during the Beijing Olympics. The Beijing Olympics last August generated more than 1 billion euro ($1.97 billion) in Chinese goods, including 8 billion euro ($12.8 billion) in cars. The Shanghai office says the logo will be re-drawn every four years. http: / / www.mohima.com / Copyright 2009 The Associated Press. Please refresh for the latest versions of the story.

335,"Want to cancel your trip? This is when you can -- and can't -- get your money back for a little more than 10% of what you paid to cancel. Starting at $645, you get a free return for each one-time airfare payment plus taxes and fees. You can travel on any international carrier through the U.S. or the Caribbean. Travel insurance is the most reliable way to retrieve your money from the airline's site. It's worth checking the company's rules and guidelines for refunds. The best thing to do right now is to consider canceling your vacation plans before traveling for a bit longer. Here are some other tips: You're not allowed to change your itinerary without the permission of your travel agent. So check with the airline. There are rules or guidelines that you have to follow, but nothing that you can use to cancel your itinerary. Don't cancel your travel plans just because your agent has a contract. You also can change your itinerary without your permission, and if your agent tells you otherwise, you could lose your entire itinerary. Travel insurance is one of the most profitable and valuable forms of insurance. It is not available to everyone. It can be yours for $150 a year. You can insure vacation days and vacations for up to $250 a person. You can also insure things like gas, food and hotels. You can also insure medical fees, but you can't insure vacation plans for less than $50 a person. Check the travel insurance companies and the airlines about canceling their policies. You are not covered by any of the major U.S. carriers. If you are having trouble understanding how to cancel your travel plans, then you should contact the company directly. If you are planning to travel on a business trip, you may want to consider canceling your itinerary. The American government offers a good way of finding out if your travel plans have been canceled.

336,"Top 10 Credit Cards For Excellent Credit As expected, consumers are trying to get a good deal, but there are still some issues to resolve. That's especially true for credit cards or lines of credit so you should take extra care before filing a claim. So make sure you get the best deal you can afford. The same goes for cash, small-dollar or card-by-wire accounts. If you're shopping this year, you might want to avoid paying more than the minimum. Some cards that are easy to use but don't get the credit you want are likely to be harder to get. Don't just get cash. It's possible to get a better rate by making a late payment on one of the cards. You can also get a higher rate if you don't need it. And if you don't use it to a certain extent, you can end up losing the item. Regardless of what's going on in your marriage or finances, you might want to consider sending a simple check to get your credit score and credit score in good standing, even if your credit history is cloudy. If your score is lower than your credit score, you need to make sure you get the money back quickly. You also need to think about setting up multiple free credit monitoring and reporting programs. The more consumers use a credit card, the more likely they are to be able to qualify for a low-interest rate loan. And there's no need to set up a credit monitoring program -- just make sure you know your credit history. If you're looking at more expensive or higher-interest loans, consider giving credit monitoring to a trusted lender who can help you find the lowest rates. Remember it's in your own best interest to make a decision about whether to pay down your debt faster than you can afford it. You can do a better job by using a credit monitor to track your borrowing, make sure you get your good credit scores and budget for it -- and make sure you have the right credit report for your credit.

342,"How non-alcoholic cocktails are shaking up the bar scene Not only do non-alcoholic drinks make it onto the menu at the bar, they're also popular among the public. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) estimates that around 1.5 million people regularly drink ciders, lagers and lager at bars across the UK. Wine cocktails, such as the ""sour cherry and rum"" or the ""roasted pork and bacon"" - all of which are made from ethanol - are a good choice for those who are not keen on a traditional drink. ""We've come a long way since the days of trying to replace the traditional pub in a 21st-century pub with a hotel and some kind of bar,"" BBPA chief executive Simon Douglas said. Increasingly, we're seeing that, with the increase in the number of people who are drinking. Over the last 40 years, it has changed for many reasons. The traditional drinking culture has changed and the bar has evolved. The BBPA says that the number of people drinking a spirit drink is now about five times what they were in the 19th century. ""The bar has become more competitive, which is good for the drinks industry,"" Douglas said. The BBPA also says that the number of people drinking wine drinks is up by nearly a third in the last 12 months. Other drinks, such as the ""sweet and sour cherry and rum of the mid-20th century,"" are also a popular choice for those who are not keen on a traditional pub in a 21st-century pub. The BBPA has also released a list of the beer buzzwords that have made the top 10 list. The list includes the traditional roast chicken, apple and pear. The BBPA wants to encourage responsible drinking by encouraging people to drink more non-alcoholic drinks, rather than choose non-alcoholic bottles. The BBPA has also released an encyclopaedic guide to how to enjoy a non-alcoholic beer. The guide includes recipes by famous chefs such as Eric Ripert, Michel Roux Jr and Michel Roux Jr and a series of tips on how to make your own cocktail.

Each of the rooms has a huge open floor plan which contains a sauna, steam room, sauna and marble bathrooms. There's also a bar, an outdoor terrace and two restaurants, a bar, and a kitchen. The restaurant, which is situated in the centre of the park, is open all day, seven days a week from 8am to 3pm. ""A lot of people come here to stay but there is an attraction to visit Stockholm,"" says Marieke Stearns, Director of the hotel. There is something really magical about a hotel with a spa and bars. It's a really unique experience but also a delight for visitors. The hotel also has a range of restaurants which can be found in the surrounding area.

There are also several restaurants which look over the park including a kale bar serving everything from salmon to fish lasagne. The hotel is open from April to October and costs from 174 kronor (£113) per night. Tickets are available on request from March 24. The Telegraph is working with a number of local councils in the city to find accommodation for the tourists of the area. The hotel will be open from Monday April 10.

344,"Step into the world of America's most notorious gangster. Mark Twain famously wrote that ""it is not a crime"" to believe that ""the law of attraction has no place at the table of law or public discourse."" That's a view that has only recently been validated by the New Jersey Supreme Court. In a case that has been challenging police tactics and the use of force, the court ruled that the law in question is ""unconstitutional,"" and that it is not worth enforcing. But, unlike the New York ruling, the Pennsylvania decision made the law in question. The law in question is a provision of the 2008 USA Patriot Act that criminalizes crimes committed in the state where the crime occurred. There were only two convictions under this law in the state: both of them for the robbery and assault crimes of which only one was for assault. When you consider that Twain is considered the first to strike the correct note, it's important to note that the law in question is not a law designed to deter the people of the state. It's a law designed to discourage crime in the state where the crime occurred. It's a law designed to keep criminals out of the state where the crime occurred. What's new in this case is that both the law and the Pennsylvania decision have made it possible for criminal defendants to be tried on the basis of evidence obtained under the statute, rather than the evidence obtained by the state. In other words, under the Pennsylvania statute, the state is able to convict people on the basis of evidence obtained since the crime occurred, rather than evidence obtained after the crime occurred. That is the case with the Twain case. In Pennsylvania, prosecutors can charge a defendant who is not in the country legally when he or she is arrested but is convicted on the basis of evidence obtained under the statute. In other words, under the Pennsylvania law, a defendant who is in the United States illegally when he or she is arrested is imprisoned for at least a year and a half, rather than the year and a half that is typically required by law. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling stated that the law ""does not require a prosecutor to prove that an arrest was authorized by the statute in the person's case."" The case in question, the Twain case, is still pending before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Read Next: ""My New Jersey Wacka Boat"": The ""New Jersey Mafios"
345,"Why Britain's hated Pacer trains just won't go away The first time I met the new Chief Executive, Lord Adonis, in 2007, I was delighted to shake his hand and congratulate him on the transformation at the troubled firm. my new boss had been appointed two years earlier to lead the train-maker's turnaround, and it was clear he had the necessary skills and a vision to turn it around. Fast-forward to today and Adonis, who took over as chief executive in November, is clearly on a roll. The company is already in the process of transforming itself into a leaner, more focused operation, with a fleet of 787s, a new fleet of 630 buses and rolling stock that should take its place in a fleet that operates to about 70 per cent of UK rail journeys by 2020. Suddenly, Pacer is a far healthier, more reliable company - and it is getting better. It is expanding rapidly across Europe with new order books and has just announced plans for a new franchise in France. It has also overtaken its larger rival, the Dutch group Abellio. Quite why, in the wake of its near wipeout at the start of last year, Adonis' turnaround may have been more difficult for the board. It is a big firm but if we were to take Adonis on as chief executive in the second half of 2017, he would be a very good fit for the ailing company. His background is in manufacturing, and his experience in Pacer, the manufacturer of the new £5 handrail, is limited. He has never worked in a building before, so he has little experience of building or running a brand. When it comes to building a brand, Adonis has a very good deal of design and building experience. He was one of the first to assess the extent of the problems plaguing Pacer, which has been losing £200m a year in the UK. But he also understands the difficulties of overhauling the business - which could take much longer. A lot of Pacer's problems, including the fact that it is facing huge losses, lie with the way it is run. But some of his biggest challenges are also with the drivers, who need to be able to get on and off the trains and avoid the delays or overcrowding that make the network congested. He will have a tough time persuading the public that Pacer has the"
346,"9 things that will make flying on an airplane better Airplanes come with limitations, including being unpressurized, and the length of your flight, but it can make flying much safer in the skies. An unpressurized aircraft would enable you to travel more slowly and have fewer problems, and give you the freedom to be safe. Here is a list of nine things that make flying much safer. Airports and airfields in the world have never been as safe as they are today. Many airports and airfields in the United States have a lot of runways for pilots and crew, but those are in place for safety reasons. Airports do not have all the space needed for landing and take-off, and many of the runways in the world are too small to support landing aircraft. Many airports don't have the runway space to support a plane that can safely land or take off. Many airports also have restricted airspace or are in a state of decline due to the high cost of funding and a lack of runway space. To see the list of these and other great things to remember about flying, see our list of the 10 most-dangerous countries in the world. When it comes to safety, safety is a top priority at all levels, including airlines, airports, railroads and airliners. More than 70 percent of last year's more than 2,000 flights occurred in the United States. As airlines begin to upgrade their routes and aircraft, passengers will soon have a better option. The government is building better runways and airports, and some airlines and cruise lines have begun installing new aircraft catering services. These improvements will help airlines improve on their operations and could even be an additional factor in safety. Airports and airports have never been as safe as they are today. Many of the world's biggest airports have runways for pilots and crew, but these are mostly in their prime for commercial use. Many airports also don't have enough room to fit aircraft. They are often found at intersections, making them unsuitable for passenger flow. Airports are often heavily designed and have no-runway runways. Airports may need to build new runways. They can only respond to changes in traffic conditions when there is an increased demand in the air system. These improvements can help airlines and airports as they improve their operations and aircraft. This article first appeared on Mosaic, an aviation news and information site.

348,"Private jets are taking off because of coronavirus, health officials say The C.D.C. is sending a plane to protect employees from the outbreak of the coronavirus, after a plane landed at New York's JFK Airport yesterday with sick passengers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that the plane landed at about 2 p.m., after a woman who'd been sick for more than a week took a flight from Los Angeles to Washington. The plane was inspected and tested for any other types of disease. The CDC is using a specially designed aircraft to transport employees and visitors to the U.S. to stay home, but the plane is not required to be flown by air ambulance because of the outbreak. The CDC said that in the last week, eight people have been infected with the virus. In the previous 24 hours, seven cases had been reported in New York City, seven in New Jersey and two in the nation, according to Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC. ""We're expecting it to be a long and painful one,"" Frieden said. People with health problems should take precautions. Frieden said that if people are sick, they should contact their health care provider if they think they may have symptoms of the illness. A person who has traveled abroad should contact their doctor, Frieden said. ""This is not a swine flu outbreak,"" Frieden said. We're not seeing a disease outbreak in the United States. The CDC said the flight from Los Angeles to Washington was carrying 38 passengers. The CDC said the plane was equipped with an oxygen system, a temperature-controlled emergency oxygen system and a bio-hazard suit. This is the second time in as many weeks that a private plane has flown from New York City, where it had taken off for Los Angeles several days prior to the outbreak. Recently, an Air France plane had to make an emergency landing at New York's JFK International Airport after a passenger thought he had the flu and fell ill. The two passengers were allowed to fly for a short time after landing. The plane has since been cleaned and the plane is being inspected, Frieden said. CDC: The rise of the common cold virus Last week, the CDC announced that the number of reported illnesses associated with the H1N1 flu virus in the United States had increased to nearly 90,000. The CDC said that of the patients who started the most illnesses, 12 percent suffered from"

Uruguay's president, Jose Mujica, says the region is a must-visit destination.

Mujica has already hinted that Uruguay could be set to become a top wine destination by 2020. ""With its beautiful mountains, red and pink rivers and fantastic wine regions, Uruguay is definitely a prime destination for holidaymakers,"" he said. The country has one of the fastest growing economies in the world to the tune of $1.5 trillion, and Mujica says it is expected to more than double its GDP this year. However, it is still far behind its neighbours, such as Argentina, who have more than $3.5 trillion in GDP. Uruguay's popularity has increased in recent years thanks to the country's spectacular scenery and the fact that it has the world's highest number of wine cellars, an international league table of the best in the world. The country also boasts some of the highest incomes in Latin America, with the world's seventh most populous country the world's 18th most populous nation. Uruguay is also known for its wine production, which is currently worth around $9 billion a year. The country has been nicknamed ""the wine capital of the world"" due to the high levels of wine production in the country, with the average wine produced per hectare now being valued at $300. It's not just the wealth of winemakers that is attracting visitors to Uruguay. The country boasts an estimated 2.2 million hectares for wine production, making it one of the most popular wine producing countries in the world. The country also has nearly 50 million inhabitants, and is home to some of the world's best vineyards, including the highly respected San Lorenzo. With a population of around 1.2 million, Uruguay has always been a wealthy and industrialised nation. But it also has its critics, including the United States, which has called Uruguay a ""wine dictatorship."""

352,"Japanese chef carves food into incredible pieces of art Japanese chef can create incredible art while wearing his finger puppet The 42-year-old uses only his finger as part of his creations, and each piece is made by hand The creators have created unique pieces using only their real hands and are now going head-to-head with other artists It's easy to forget to remove your finger, especially if you have mastered the art of carving food. But Japanese chef Nobuyuki Matsuhisa has revealed some impressive talent by using only his finger. The 42-year-old is known for his extraordinary carving abilities as he performs everything from delicate Japanese delicacies to delicate creations. And his creations, which take a total of 8 hours to complete, are so detailed the owner must have had a hand in creating them. Matsuhisa, who is based in Osaka, Japan, has been working as a chef at a number of Michelin starred establishments for around ten years. His unique method involves moulding tiny, hand-made plates and frying them before wrapping them in a piece of paper, using only his finger. As well as carving food, the talented chef also uses hand tools to create intricate shapes which he then sticks his finger into. 215 shares While the nails must be fresh, the chef inserts a small amount of oil into the plates. He then fills in the oil with a small amount of water, before covering the fingers with sesame seeds. Matsuhisa has also scraped together the sesame seeds from the wood and leaves. He then fills the plates up with the broth before carving the pieces outwards, leaving a trail of brown sesame seeds behind. Matsuhisa came up with the idea after he got a phone call from a friend who was working as an artist at a nearby restaurant. He was instantly taken with his unique method as he performed his stunts at the restaurant kitchen. In an interview with the Tokyo Times, Matsuhisa said: 'I was called to the restaurant and told how many plates had been created and the cooks had started making the plates. I thought it would be cool to play with them and to create something beautiful. But the best part about it is that they were hands-on, and I have to say that they are nice and simple."

The new ""Jungle Bubbles"" hotel, which is based on the popular ""Jungle Book"" film franchise, is one of several for the Golden Triangle. The hotel has been dubbed a ""jungle"" for its extreme, pouty and colourful offerings. ""The Golden Triangle attracts guests from all over the world,"" Lt. Col. of the Golden Triangle Police Major-General Piyapong Bungamkul said in a statement. ""It will not only be the first jungle hotel, we have the largest number of guests here in the world,"" he said. The new ""Jungle Bubbles"" hotel is located in the capital Bangkok, and can accommodate up to 100 people. ""We are working to arrange a room for guests,"" said Songkrit Trikgam, who is head of the Golden Triangle's tourism agency. The main attraction will be the ""jungle bubble"" and ""jungle bubble"" hotel, a tent made of bamboo and plastic. The first ""jungle bubble"" hotel opened in the city of Chiang Mai in 1999.

The Actis Hotel and Spa is Sweden's first-ever luxury floating hotel, and is currently under construction in the northern region of Öland, but will be open in the future. The Actis Hotel and Spa, or ""the hotel of the future,"" is a popular spot for visitors to enjoy a glass of wine and a private beach. The elegant, minimalist hotel was built by Swedish architecture firm Alfons Moderna at a cost of over a million Swedish kronor ($131,894) ""It's really impressive... but it's also very comfortable,"" Soren Wallin, a tourism executive with Alfons Moderna, told the TT newswire. Wallin said the hotel has been designed to be able to accommodate guests for a ""weekend only,"" and that the hotel will feature a private garden. Wallin said that it will be open to the general public from February, but that the site will be designated a special luxury residential area by the Local Authority (Långväll) by the end of 2016. ""We're working on a special offer [of the hotel] in the spring,"" Wallin said. Wallin said that the hotel is not the first floating hotel in Sweden. In 2012, the Swedish Association of Hotelkeepers (IKHH) announced that the number of hotel rooms in Sweden had surged by 21 percent between 2009 and 2010. The IKHH said that 1,191 hotels opened in 2011. However, the figure is expected to rise to 1,133 by the end of the year. The Actis Hotel and Spa is located above Karlstad. Wallin said that the hotel will be open from August to December, and that it will have a fully equipped restaurant and bar. The Actis Hotel and Spa is to be built on a 400-year-old river that flows through Karlstad. Wallin hopes that the hotel will be able to accommodate more than 100,000 people, and that the hotel will become a tourist destination. ""We see this as the largest project in Sweden so far,"" Wallin said. READ ALSO: 'Swan Lake' hotel opens in Vienna, Austria Photo: Actis Hotel and Spa"

A spokesperson for the show, which airs on Mondays, said: 'The show was filmed and approved by the producers, and producers did not feel it was appropriate for the audience to be in their seats during a transmission. We would like to apologise to the audience, who were disappointed by the initial broadcast of the show and for any inconvenience caused. The viewing figures of the episode were below the normal levels for such a programme, and we are working on re-editing it in a different format. MailOnline has contacted ITV for comment. Caroline Flack's sister, Chloe, 25, has also hit out at the' hysteria 'surrounding her sister's death that she believes is' being used as a weapon to try and get the show to change. 'Speaking at the Cannes Lions Festival with her sister at the time, Chloe revealed that the reality show's producers have only used her death as a' PR tool '. She said:' They don't want to know what's happened. They never will. They've used it as a weapon to try and get the show to change. Chloe also hinted that the show's producers may look into her death when they run out of options, and that the fans should 'know better'. She added: 'It's so unfair. I'm sure the producers will look at it and decide if they have the option of reworking it, or not.' A spokesperson for Love Island told MailOnline: 'We're incredibly saddened to hear about Caroline Flack's death. Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with her friends, family and fans at this incredibly difficult time. MailOnline has approached Caroline Flack's representatives for further comment. With the show currently airing on ITV2, fans were left speculating on the fate of a number of contestants. At the start of the season, the reality stars were said to be alarmed by the lack of' romance 'between Caroline Flack and Kem Cetinay. One source even claimed that the pair were' at war ', yet the Love Island star remained defiant throughout the show's debut episode. Kem recently confessed to The Sun:' Caroline and Kem were saying they were going to be together forever and it was all a bit of a shock."
357,"Boris Johnson won't be tested despite UK health minister contracting coronavirus Boris Johnson's department will not test him for the deadly SARS virus despite it being discovered he contracted it during a flight to Australia. Mr Johnson, the London mayor, was on a business trip to Sydney when he contracted the disease shortly after his arrival in the country last week. A close friend of Mr Johnson has previously confirmed that the Foreign Secretary will remain under medical observation at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital for approximately a week. A spokesperson for the Department of Health said: ""The Foreign Secretary is at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital undergoing treatment for a virus that has spread from person to person. All appropriate UK Government medical staff are working to minimise any risk to the public. Mr Johnson was confirmed to have contracted the disease by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and was flown to hospital in Sydney on Friday. Health officials will be monitoring the situation. A spokesman for Mr Johnson said:"" The Mayor is in Australia as part of the Government's response to the Ebola crisis and the London Mayor is fit to return to the UK. He is not ill. The Foreign Office released a statement on Friday night confirming Mr Johnson was now stable and not critically ill. The Foreign Secretary was diagnosed with SARS in Abu Dhabi in August and has recovered sufficiently to leave hospital. However, he had to cancel a trip to the Far East for the first time in November after becoming concerned at his temperature. It was initially thought he contracted the virus on his way to the Middle East. The Government is now using the same routine screening procedure that Mr Johnson was in during his time in Abu Dhabi as it attempts to find out whether he contracted the disease. The Government has also been asked to provide advice on what precautions should be taken if Mr Johnson is in the Middle East. The London Mayor has been in touch with his doctor and appropriate precautions have been put in place. It is believed that he contracted the virus on his way to Australia after his first appointment to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (RBWH) in Brisbane. The Foreign Secretary is currently in hospital under anaesthetic and will remain under medical observation for the next six weeks. The Foreign Office will continue to provide consular assistance to the family during this period. A UK Government spokesman said: ""We're working closely with the UK authorities."""

The town has been under a state of emergency since the bloody gang attack on a Tunisian beach on Sousse in June, which left 38 people dead. Security forces are continuing to patrol the town, an area that's a major holiday destination for people from all over the country, including to Italy. The Bari police chief, Marco Dalla Valle, said authorities were trying to convince residents that the situation was under control. ""The situation is currently being monitored by the police,"" Dalla Valle said in a tweet. Police said extra officers would be on patrol to keep everyone safe, and people had been ordered to stay inside. A man with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, apparently aligned with Islamic State, launched the attack at the Bari beach on Friday, police said. At least five people were killed, while dozens were wounded. Police said they were still trying to determine whether the attacker had accomplices. The attack came just days after 20 people were killed in an attack on a Tunisian beach in which gunmen killed 38 people.

360,"Desperate migrants keep coming. Now vigilantes are threatening the welcomers with knives, guns and even a machete. One even tried to break into the camp, when officers were finally able to stop the migrants by smashing their way into their truck. The migrants are now threatening to storm the Dover port and force a ferry to come to their aid in a bid to get to Calais. Britain and France have ramped up security at Calais following the destruction of a Jungle camp earlier this year. The growing worry over the French migrant population has increased tension in northern France, where local authorities are struggling to cope with a huge influx of refugees. Elsewhere in the country, hundreds of migrants were arrested and rounded up as police tried to stop a truck heading east on the motorway to Britain. Locals say the migrants may have used the truck to try to stow away on a truck heading for Britain. It comes after British security forces were forced to close down an iconic Jungle camp - which was razed to the ground in October - following violent clashes between migrants and police. On July 18, riot police moved in to clear the camp of tents and other objects left over from the shantytown's removal in 2016. On October 12, hundreds of migrants were arrested in Calais when French police moved in to clear the camp of tents and other items left over from the shantytown's removal in 2016. The makeshift refugee camp in the northern French port town was used as a makeshift shantytown by migrants. In the space of a few days, hundreds more were arrested. The Dover tunnel was now a makeshift shelter for hundreds of thousands of people, including many Afghans who have escaped war and poverty in the Middle East. Refugees from the camp have set up tents and shelters across France. In recent weeks, dozens of migrants have been arrested trying to get to Britain, with police using tear gas and water cannon to disperse them. Police had warned that the situation in Calais would get 'out of hand' if migrants continued to pour into the port and try to stow away on trucks heading for Britain. Since the closure of the Jungle camp, there has been a dramatic decrease in the amount of violent crime in the area as a number of migrants have applied for asylum in France or dispersed into other parts of the EU."
361,"Putin backs amendment that could see him run Russia until 2036 By Charles Clover and Guy Faulconbridge in Moscow Last Updated: 7: 37PM GMT 20 Nov 2008 The bill could require the President to step down after the next presidential election on March 4, 2011. However, a State Duma resolution passed on Friday calls for ""a complete review"" of the constitution, with the president resigning. It is unlikely that the debate will feature any surprises from the Duma, which is dominated by Mr Putin's United Russia party. The United Russia party currently dominates the Duma with 56 out of 222 seats, with the current Duma being the state senate. Russia has no elected representatives in the lower houses and the president cannot be removed with a majority in the upper house. Both the United Russia party and the Kremlin still hold a majority in the Duma and both are expected to win seats in the Duma next year. The bill is being drafted by President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitri Peskov and passed with a majority of 128 votes. The United Russia leadership has said repeatedly that Mr Putin is responsible for Russia's most important interests, should he be sworn in. The bill would grant Mr Putin a second term in office for a maximum two terms, after which he would be elected president again. Dmitry Rogozin, the Communist Party of Russia's deputy leader, said the Duma decision was a ""political decision."" It is important that political decisions and the law are respected. This is an illegal interference in Russian internal affairs, ""he said, according to Lenta.ru, a Russian state broadcaster. Mr Rogozin said he would now try to persuade the Duma to reject the bill."" We want to find an alternative in the region, ""he said. We want to discuss our position. Mr Rogozin said he had been asked by Mr Putin to introduce the bill, but he had refused because he wanted the matter settled immediately. The Kremlin-controlled television channel Rossiya 24 said the bill would be submitted to parliament for a vote next month. Mr Rogozin said he would consider it in the light of the Duma's decision in its final stages. The United Russia party currently holds 26 seats and the Kremlin has dominated Russian politics since the 1991 Soviet collapse. But the party is now neck and neck with Mr Putin's United Russia in parliamentary elections. The United Russia party has been accused of corruption and abuse of power"

Harry and Meghan have long been seen as a couple who may have had their ups and downs, but they showed they're certainly keeping their emotions in check. As Harry and Meghan left the church with their eyes closed and the wedding party having been moved into the Kensington Gardens, crowds of well-wishers shouted ""thank you"" to the pair. The couple came dressed in their best wedding outfits for the occasion and left the church with their mother and stepfather, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The royal couple paid a formal visit to the local community centre, in a bid to help tackle loneliness. The couple were able to speak to those they knew so well at the centre, during a brief tour of its facilities. Harry and Meghan will now visit Nottingham, Leicester, Norwich, Leeds, Glasgow and Cardiff before returning to Kensington Palace for Prince Harry and Meghan's wedding on 19 May. Prince Harry attended the closing ceremony in Leicester on Thursday and will meet the team behind the wedding. The venue is not known for security reasons. The couple's close friendship is seen as a positive influence in helping to prevent loneliness. Both Kensington Palace and Clarence House declined to comment, but the prince is expected to bring his bride-to-be to the service at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stayed at the palace after the wedding and will visit the scene of their engagement in the grounds of the Chapel Royal. Harry was born on 22 May 21 at St Mary's Hospital in London, the same month as the wedding of his older brother, Prince William, and his wife Kate. The young prince has no direct connection to the Prince of Wales, who is currently on a 10-day tour of Australia, Fiji and Tonga. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding is likely to be another landmark. The couple has already made a significant contribution to British society by their charitable work, particularly in their support for the homeless and their own charitable projects.

364,"Self-isolate or get paid? That's the choice for gig workers in a virus outbreak, and it's a big problem for the rest of us. The U.S. Department of Labor has long been the most vocal critic of self-employment. Last year, the Labor Department's inspector general issued a report critical of the gig economy, and one executive has said he expects the government to review its guidelines on security threats. ""Too often we see the government trying to hide facts to discredit the workforce,"" says John Verdi, president of the Communications Workers of America, an industry group that represents workers who are self-employed. But that's not how the work of a lot of individuals is managed. In 2013, the Labor Department issued new guidelines that clarified a policy that prohibited self-employment. Such guidelines were adopted in the hope that self-employment would become the new normal. The new guidelines can be found here. The rule change might have been a small step toward self-employment, but it was part of a bigger, sweeping overhaul of the way the federal government tracks employment, a measure that has created a new job-killing, economic-stimulus-laden mess that is the subject of litigation in the federal courts. The new policy is called the Fair Labor Standards Act. But the industry association that represents the workers of the gig economy said that this new rule takes a big step backwards. ""The new rules simply will not be sufficient to protect workers,"" PWU International President Kevin Hassett said. The proposed regulations are welcome, but they are not the solution to the problem. This is a blatant effort by the Obama administration to protect a group of workers who were not hired for their full-time employment. Hassett added that the lack of any evidence that self-employment is a threat to the country means there is no legal basis for the policy. We are not calling for a new federal rule. We are calling for a federal law that will protect workers, ""Hassett said. That's what this is all about. We are calling for a law that will protect workers from the threat of exploitation. Hassett says the new policy will be in place for several months, so workers may not be able to sue the government for lost wages. But the association argues that this will give employers more time to prepare for a new era of employment. The law doesn't change today. It just strengthens their ability to move forward,"" Hassett said"

The university announced it was creating the course, which will be hosted by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, in partnership with mental health charity Mind, after a report found that thousands of women suffer from ""silent"" or ""hidden"" mental health problems as a result of their experiences as women. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are attending the event in London in support of the Heads Together campaign, a UK-wide project that aims to improve mental health in women and girls. The event will take place at Kingsway School, where more than 1,000 women have chosen to take part. Heads Together will be the first project to directly engage young people with mental health issues in the UK, and it is hoped that the initiative will encourage discussions and provide support to those affected. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will take part in the Heads Together event. Photograph: Sarah Lee / PA The Royal couple, who are patrons of the project, are also inviting researchers and teachers to join them on the day to discuss the consequences of stigma surrounding mental health issues and work to encourage greater understanding of what it means to be ""silent."" Heads Together aims to help women to understand the ""hidden"" mental health issues they face on a daily basis, and to break down barriers that exist between women and girls. Mind said that many women who are not able to access support services because they are ""scared of a role model"" are left without the support they need. It said that women often don't know they're a victim because they are ashamed, embarrassed or even think they're ""a victim."" It added that around one in 400 women experience mental health problems during their lives, and that one in 10 suffers from a mental health problem. The Duchess of Sussex said in a statement: ""Every woman deserves to feel safe and supported, and it is right that women and men have the right to feel safe and heard, without being stigmatised."" This week the Duke and Duchess of Sussex travelled to Canada to see the first new centre in London for women's mental health - the National Centre for Mental Health.

In the latest study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications, researchers from the University of North Carolina found that preppers have survived years of mockery, disease and stress. Preppers have survived periods of ill health, and often experienced psychological trauma because of the exposure to the virus. Preppers, meanwhile, have survived cold winters, illness and a host of other challenges. The study found that the preppers had been able to recover from the virus after the virus had moved from their original hosts, and that the preppers were still at an important stage of microbial transmission. ""The risk of infection is reduced when preppers persist in their current behaviour, as the virus does not have an adaptive host,"" said the study's author, Dr. Chris Neff, a professor of microbiology at North Carolina State University. The preppers may have been infected by the virus, but their immunity from colonization may have been compromised because of this, the study found. ""Preppers are in a poor state of health,"" Neff told Fox News. They are probably living in a very viable environment with immunity. They don't have any problems with the environment, but there are other dangers in the environment. The study provides some good news for the viruses that cause the most severe respiratory infections, study author Dr. Joel Dworet, also a professor of microbiology at the University of North Carolina, said. ""When germs spread, they are not just spread from person to person, they come from things that they find in their environment,"" Dworet said. They do have a range of transmission types, and that can have a severe impact on the health of each individual. These include influenza, enteroviruses, typhoid, influenza B and chikungunya.

367,"Everything travelers need to know about coronavirus When the virus was first detected in Egypt and subsequently spread to its neighbors in Haiti and the United States, it was difficult to gauge the extent of the problem. But now, health officials have announced a new travel alert for travelers traveling to the region. ""It's an infectious disease... and people should know that it's just a virus,"" Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told CBS News' Charlie D'Agata. The vaccine protects people for up to 72 hours, but some people with weakened immune systems, or those with chronic medical conditions, get active during this time. But it's not known how effective the vaccine is in preventing the infection. Officials have not determined how the virus got its name. In cases where people get the flu, they may develop hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can lead to kidney failure, and also can cause serious complications such as pneumonia and liver cancer. For those who need to travel, they can get the flu shot at any age and at no cost. The CDC is advising all travelers not to go to places where the virus is prevalent. Those who do get the vaccine should be vaccinated because if they do become sick, they may not have it or they may not pass on the infection. People who can't get the vaccine are urged to get it from their doctor. The CDC is urging passengers to get their flu shot at a pharmacist or on the airline or hotel website. ""If you get it from a doctor, you should be able to get a vaccine in your area,"" Frieden said. Before you travel, you should make sure you take the necessary precautions in case you are sick. The CDC's travel page also states that there has been a spike in reported cases of the virus in recent weeks. An updated travel alert also says that the virus has the potential to cause serious complications, and is not covered by insurance. It also advises using condoms or covering your mouth and nose and nose when you are exposed to the virus.

368,"Are cell phone calls on airplane flights inevitable? (CBS / AP) A new study suggests cell phone calls may be due - technically - to a change in the way airplanes communicate. It says people are using cell phones to call and send messages and text messages. The research was conducted by researchers at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Ky., and the University of Chicago. The study is published in Tuesday's issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The scientists aren't talking about a ""wireless terminal"" - the term they call it - but instead suggest that cell phone use might be behind the boom in cell phone use on planes. ""When you hear passengers say, 'Oh, my God, I called your flight on my cell phone,' you can imagine how people like that and can take advantage of that,"" said study lead researcher Christopher P. Barrett of the University of Missouri. The study involved the first time a group of people tried to call a plane using a cellphone. And once the people got home, they listened to their calls. With the help of the flight crew and the telephone, the researchers could show how many people were calling. And the phone calls were recorded, then sent back to the phone companies. The study also found that the problem might be coming from people not using a cell phone in the first place, like they were listening to music or playing a computer game. The problem can get worse for people on planes that have to be quiet. ""Most of us think of cell phones as our gateway to text messaging,"" Barrett said. But the problem is not just on planes. The problem is that cell phones don't talk. ""We have to figure out how to make them talk,"" Barrett said. We have to figure out how to make them talk.

The company, which has just been approved by Taiwan's Civil Aviation Administration, is one of the first of six new airline companies that will operate daily flights to Taipei and other major Chinese cities, according to the company's website. STARLUX is a brand of China's second-biggest carrier, China Eastern Orbital. It flies into Taipei from the neighboring cities of Zhuhai and Liaoning, and then travels to the Taipei-Hong Kong airport for takeoff. It does not carry passengers. STARLUX's first flight from Taiwan to Hong Kong was a glider-powered flight from Taipei to Beijing. The flight took five hours and 15 minutes, according to STARLUX's website The STARLUX app can be downloaded on iPhone and Android devices. The app also gives passengers a detailed preview of its route and airfare. The company's website says it's aiming to eventually fly to as many as 50 cities. STARLUX is a subsidiary of the Taiwan Airports Limited Corp., a country's largest airline operator. STARLUX was founded in 1999 by the aviation industry in Taiwan and is now the largest airline in Taiwan. The airline is currently in its 42nd year.

Photo: Public Works / Flickr With a view to connecting Copenhagen and its suburbs, Denmark's first new subway line, Metro, is a beautiful little project that is a huge surprise to the public and the developers of the design announced on Wednesday. The project, which is set to start running in 2018, will have a total length of around 210 kilometres. The first phase will have eight stations. The first phase will be between Copenhagen and its suburbs in the north of the city. There, the line will be able to run at times as fast as 620 kilometres per hour. The second phase will run between Copenhagen and its neighbouring suburbs. The project will have a total length of around 210 kilometres. The original Metro concept has always been about a high-frequency signal. The idea is more a concept like that of the Moto X - the kind of network where people can interact with each other. And so it's not just a train line, it's an underground network because it is easy to connect to other systems, ""the project's general manager Johan Engh Jensen told Danish newspaper Telegraaf. It will also be a link to the Copenhagen city centre. It will be the first line for the subway system. It will be part of a much-needed infrastructure that links the public and the streets and transport. It will be a direct link between central Copenhagen and the whole city,"" Jensen said. The first phase will have three stations, with the other two to be located on side streets. The first will be between Copenhagen and its neighbouring suburbs in the north of the city. The second will be between Copenhagen and its neighbouring suburbs in the south. It will be a link between Copenhagen and the whole city, ""Jensen said."" We believe that this will be a symbol of great unity, peace and harmony in the city, ""he added. The project will also involve a new station and a redesign of the old line. The new line will be the first high-frequency signal between the two cities. The project is set to cost approximately 620 million kroner ($783 million). The new line will undergo a multi-year development process. The city will need to make a decision on the final price."

373,"How Budapest became a fine dining force to be reckoned with A friend of mine used to work at the Italian restaurant La Porta. We'd go there for dinner a few times a week, or for a bottle of wine every Friday to celebrate special occasions. As well as being a bar, La Porta was a place where there was a lot of drinking. I had no idea the Michelin restaurant was in a great location - in a city with so much history to rival anything else in the world. In the 1930s, the city was still in a state of war, but the war was over. The restaurants were still a bit on the run. But by the 1970s, the food was very popular. There used to be a lot of noise about them, but now it brings people to the streets. In the afternoon, the food is better than you think. On a sunny Sunday, you can get the whole family in the dining room. The bar is next to the train station. It's really interesting to see so many people taking a bite. They'd bring their own stuff, and they would drink the same beer. In the evening, the food is really good. Budapest has been at the forefront of the cultural sector since the days of Emperor Nero. When I was younger, I was at the forefront of the food world and a lot of chefs were influenced by the city. So that's why it's such a beautiful city right now.

375,"Azerbaijan's secret to long life? Mountain air travel BAKU, Azerbaijan -- As the country gets ready to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, Azerbaijan has been testing out a new type of air travel that will help keep the country healthy. The air is more comfortable. It's more hygienic, ""says Azerbaijan's deputy prime minister and first deputy prime minister. But that's not the only thing the country's authorities have been racing to develop. Azerbaijan has a great deal of natural resources, and there are lots of other industries where Azerbaijan has lots of resources. The country is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union and is the only nation in the world that has a constitution guaranteeing a free press. Azerbaijan's parliament has set up a special committee to investigate how to make the country a more democratic place. Its budget for transportation will be about $100 million -- more than the average for other countries."" We are going to start a dialogue with the country about a proposal to transfer some of the Azerbaijani oil proceeds from that oil to the citizens and to other projects, ""said Azerbaijani Prime Minister Aliyev. The oil has already been transferred to the citizens of Armenia. Azerbaijan has agreed to sell some of its country's oil for development in the region. Some of the money could go to build a new port or to boost the economy. But at the moment, that won't occur. In the meantime, we are going to use all the resources that we have to develop our economy. And we will use all the resources that we have to develop both locally and internationally,"" said Deputy Prime Minister Elmar Mammadyarov. ""For sure, if you don't live in a civilized country, it is better to stay in a civilized country,"" Mammadyarov continued. If you use your resources efficiently and improve the quality of your life, obviously you are moving toward a better economy and a happier life. It's a good thing to do. So far, the Azerbaijani government has invested some $15 billion dollars of oil revenue into making the capital Baku a more efficient city. The country has also set up a transportation and transportation infrastructure fund to help fund improvements in infrastructure.

376,"Eternal flame: How Azerbaijan became the 'Land of Fire' The country is now home to the world's largest and most expensive biomass plant, which produces 40% of the country's electricity and 15% of its gas, and has been given a new uranium contract. There are more than 500 people working at the plant. ""We know what is burned at Azerbaijan,"" said the plant's managing director Mammadov Karimov, adding that biofuels are a big improvement on fossil fuels, which account for 85% of the country's energy. The plant is set to host Russia's first nuclear power plant and, according to the president, the country could expand its nuclear capacity. With these two projects, the Azerbaijan government hopes to put on a strong show in international forums as well as in the world. ""Today, Azerbaijan is a global leader in biofuels,"" said the president. I think we have achieved great success, in growing up and in being the world's leading importer of foreign oil. Euronews correspondent Mohammed Shaikhibrahim said the plant's popularity in France, which already has a nuclear reactor, may increase further. ""The president is determined to keep Azerbaijan on the world's map,"" he said. The plant is expected to be up and running in 2011. Meanwhile, the country has a strong agricultural tradition, where there is plenty of work for farmers. With just one plant, it is hard to find enough produce. The land is also the most diverse in the entire country. In the past, there were several hundred indigenous farmers from different regions. But since 2000, the figure has shrunk to just 300. ""The number of indigenous people in Azerbaijan is on the rise, now it's down to 60,"" said Mammadov Karimov. ""But we need to increase our production of food,"" he added. Azerbaijan's economic woes have also contributed to the dramatic decline of the country's political parties. According to government figures, in 2014, the ruling United Democratic Party (USDP) attracted 5.9% of the vote, compared to 2.2% for the ruling Liberal Party (LDP). They were also far behind in the polls. All of the parties that govern Azerbaijan are part of the USDP."

""The Health Canada confirmed that Ms. GrÃ © goire Trudeau was diagnosed with viral coronavirus on Friday, May 28, 2016,"" a statement from the government said. She is now in the care of her family. The prime minister is attending a meeting of the G-7 nations in Sicily to discuss the risk of the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring a global public health emergency. The WHO statement added that ""this is not a health issue as had been previously reported."" As has been the case in previous years, the patient's infection did not pose a risk to the general public, the statement added. Recently, the WHO has issued a travel advisory for Canadians to avoid going to places where the disease is known, including affected areas of the western United States. The virus has been contracted in two cases in Canada over the past two years. Last week, a Canadian man contracted the disease from a person who visited an Ebola treatment center in the Liberian capital, Monrovia. He died. The man, who had not been diagnosed with the virus, had only recently arrived in Liberia, and had not received proper medical treatment. The WHO identified a new strain of the disease as a ""probable human case"" in a report released in October. The new strain poses a ""possible significant risk to infection,"" it said. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added that no new cases of the disease had been reported from Canada, while the CDC said that the risk of transmission was low. The WHO has previously declared a global public health emergency due to the possibility that global warming could cause widespread epidemics. The agency said in June 2017 that it has ""elevated"" the health threat from the Ebola virus to ""critical,"" but said it will ""continue working closely with our partners in the global health community to prepare for a potential pandemic."" The WHO has issued a red alert for the virus and urged people in 38 countries to avoid contact with people who have traveled to parts of West Africa with the virus. It has also offered vaccines to those affected countries. The WHO said last week that some regions of the world that were previously free of the virus are now working with WHO to help stop"

380,"Doctors answer your coronavirus questions: 6-step guide I've always been skeptical of the notion that the coronavirus is a serious illness. But the current study demonstrates that the virus is in the genes. My understanding is that the virus is more like a virus that moves within the body, not just inside the liver. The coronavirus causes cold sores, fever and aches and pains. Those sorts of symptoms can even leave people without any symptoms at all. However, the condition can easily spread through physical contact. For example, a person may also have a cold sore throat or irritated bowel when they go to a doctor. When they have a cold sore throat, the virus can spread to other parts of the body and cause severe illness. The coronavirus virus carries the distinct name -- coronaviruses -- in the United States. Previously, however, there was no vaccine against the virus. The virus, which is transmitted through direct contact with the blood and saliva of an infected person, is treated with anti-viral drugs such as the Tamiflu or Relenza and can be particularly deadly because of its inflammatory response. There is no cure for the coronavirus, but treatment is available. These simple steps can help reduce the risk of catching the virus by ensuring you are taking care of yourself, including avoiding contact with others, washing your hands frequently, and limiting your physical activity. Using condoms, covering kissing and sharing of personal items can also help reduce the risk of contracting disease. We also have a good idea for when to start and how far to go to protect yourself. Do your best to avoid getting sick from the virus. Use a condom when you are taking care of yourself. Don't sit in a hot car or in a public bathroom during your trip.

382,"Megan Rapinoe slams US Soccer for 'blatant sexism' Megan Rapinoe has slammed the US Soccer Federation for its' blatant sexism 'during their Women's World Cup qualifying match against Japan. Rapinoe was in the crowd supporting her team-mate Casey Stoney, who received a yellow card for confronting a Japanese player. The US have been on the receiving end of bad luck for their qualifying campaign, with the side that finished fourth at the recent CONCACAF Gold Cup losing to Honduras in the first round. Rapinoe was particularly vocal in her criticism of the US, calling the players' behaviour 'unacceptable'.'If the US took any more action against women's soccer, then it would result in more people wanting to watch the US women's team, 'she said. The US coach Jill Ellis has said that she will be assessing the situation before deciding on her future.'We definitely want to continue to educate our players and to make sure they're playing in the best possible manner,' Ellis said. But obviously our goal as Americans is to win. We want girls to play the game and be proud of their teams and our country. We want to continue to coach better, to keep improving and to keep growing and we have a lot of girls who have played in the WNBA.'I am very proud that I'm here and I want to get to know them better. 'Japanese fans have been vocal in their disapproval of the American team's decision to play Japan, with one even wearing a T-shirt depicting a man urinating and another wearing' Equality 'emblazoned on her torso. Lock forward Megan Rapinoe said that both teams had a huge amount of pride in representing their country.'As a team, we've played together for three years now and we're really proud to represent our country,' she said. And if we play like we did tonight, we get respect and a lot of kudos.'We'd have loved to have played better and we've had some great results. But at the end of the day, we've got to keep playing our game and play our game. 'Ellis said the US would have to play better if they were to progress.'My gut feeling is we need to get out there and play the type of football where we play the style of football we play,' she said."
383,"Ohio governor explains why he closed all schools after 'mass homicide' The governor of Ohio has said he is investigating a mass shooting at the school in his state last week, which left 17 dead. Governor John Kasich said in a statement: ""I'm deeply saddened by this terrible tragedy and my thoughts & prayers are with all the people involved."" The governor added that he would meet with the families of the victims before making a statement. The shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on Wednesday is one of the deadliest shootings in US history. Mr Kasich said he will work with the FBI and other federal agencies to determine what happened. ""My thoughts are with those families and those survivors who have been affected by this outrage,"" he added. The governor has spoken to the chair of the local school board and FBI director James Comey as well as others in the area, the BBC's Tom Burridge reports from the White House. The school shooting sparked a nationwide debate on gun control, with many students and parents demanding more information about the Parkland shooting, our reporter says. Mr Kasich said that while he had spoken to the FBI director, he did not know whether he had talked to US Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The White House said on Tuesday those briefed on the investigation were briefed on additional steps the FBI and the Department of Justice are taking regarding additional gun control measures. President Donald Trump has also voiced his support for tougher gun laws, and suggested he would be willing to talk to Mrs Clinton about gun control in the wake of the Connecticut tragedy. Mr Trump's spokesman Sean Spicer said the president ""believes that the Second Amendment of the United States protects our people and that we need to stop further tragedies like this happening."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Newtown has been identified as a prime target of shootings in the US in recent years The incident comes just two months after 17 people were killed in a shooting in the US city of Las Vegas. Some of the victims were aged between 12 and 22. In February, a gunman killed 58 people at a Las Vegas country music concert in a shooting spree that was claimed by the Islamic State group. The worst mass shooting in modern US history occurred on 14 October 1966, at the Dallas Cowboys' football stadium in Twin Falls, Arkansas, when a gunman opened fire on fans during a game between the rival New York Giants and San Francisco 49ers."
384,"Dow drops over 2,300 points in one day, US markets fall NEW YORK (AP) - U.S. stock indexes are falling sharply as markets in Asia and Europe tumbled in the face of worries about the health of the European economy. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 2,300 points at the 12,999 level. The Standard & Poor's 500 index is down 2,500 points at 1,339. The Nasdaq composite is down 1,580 at 2,793. Economists say the eurozone debt crisis could lead to a deeper and more severe recession in France. Greece is also in talks with its creditors to avoid defaulting on its debts. The Dow fell 155 points, or 1.4 percent, to 12,995 in the opening minutes of trading Monday. The S & P 500 index fell 78, or 3 percent, at 1,362. The Nasdaq fell 88, or 2 percent, at 2,695. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.79 percent from 1.81 percent late Friday. Stocks in Europe are down sharply. Britain's FTSE 100 is down 2.2 percent, Germany's DAX index is down 2.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 is down 2.5 percent. U.S. markets will open Tuesday with major indexes moving lower for the week. In the U.S., the government will release its monthly reading on trade. Economists expect the Commerce Department to release its report on retail sales and industrial production on Wednesday. They expect the second quarter of 2011 to show growth of 2.9 percent. In the first three months of the year, consumer spending fell 1.2 percent, the biggest decline in almost four years. Economists believe the government will report that consumer spending grew a little less than first thought. There is a fear that the country's moribund economy, which relies heavily on consumer spending, could slow further. If that happens, it could cost the economy more than $2 trillion in lost jobs. Economists also expect the unemployment rate to rise to 10.8 percent in the first quarter of 2012, up from 9.3 percent last quarter. The Federal Reserve will release its minutes from the March meeting. The minutes are expected to show that Fed policymakers see the labor market as improving. A rate hike would be crucial to propping up the economy. The minutes could also provide clues about whether the Fed will start scaling back its monthly bond purchases. The Fed's current holdings of $85 billion are set to end at the end of June."
385,"Trump suspends travel from Europe to US after Brussels attacks President Trump is suspending travel into the US from Europe and North America after Brussels attacks. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and US President Donald Trump will discuss security and intelligence matters, according to a statement from the White House. Mr Juncker said he was ""deeply concerned"" by Sunday's attacks in Brussels. Mr Trump tweets: ""We must all come together against terror. This is something that will never be forgotten. The US president has previously expressed concern about the possibility of the Brussels bomber being able to enter the country. Mr Trump is expected to visit Britain in January. The US president's action is being closely watched by British officials. The US embassy in Brussels has already warned American travelers against going to the city. The US President has previously attacked Europe's security and intelligence institutions. During a speech at Nato's summit in Brussels, Mr Trump called for a"" complete and total shutdown of Muslims entering the United States ""and expressed a desire to introduce"" extreme vetting ""for foreigners. He also criticised NATO's military efforts in Afghanistan, saying that"" a lot of countries in the world are in trouble around the world ""and that"" it's a very dangerous situation. ""Mr Trump is also expected to discuss the upcoming meetings with Mr Macron and the UK's Prime Minister Theresa May. The White House said in a statement:"" President Trump has been briefed on the investigation of the Brussels attacks. He is deeply concerned by the attacks and his thoughts and prayers are with those affected by this tragedy. The President looks forward to a full and frank discussion of the matter with Prime Minister May on the sidelines of the Nato summit in Brussels. The President has the full support of the British people and the entire administration. The President and the First Lady are deeply grateful for the significant and heartfelt UK response to the terrible attacks in Brussels last night. They have spent the last several days privately reflecting on the horrific events and jointly assessing the national security threat and the practical options that might be necessary to respond to the situation and to assure the safety of the United States and its citizens. Mr Trump and Mrs May agreed to remain in the UK at the start of the week following the Brussels attacks. The President and First Lady will now travel to Saudi Arabia, Israel and Italy during their trip. Mr Trump will visit Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian Territories in the coming weeks. He will continue to discuss the Middle East."
386,"Utah Jazz player tests positive for coronavirus, NBA suspends season SALT LAKE CITY (Reuters) - Utah Jazz forward Trey Burke has tested positive for the coronavirus, the National Basketball Association (NBA) team said on Monday. Burke, who averaged 3.2 points and 2.6 rebounds during Utah's first 18 games of the 2015-16 season, had been at risk of infection for the last five weeks, which the Jazz said prompted the team's action against him. ""This is not an isolated case but an isolated situation,"" Utah Jazz general manager Kevin O'Connor said in a statement. Trey has already been through a rigorous treatment process and we believe that it is the right decision for him to begin his professional basketball career with the organization. The Utah Jazz said it would not comment on the status of the player. Utah is on a six-game losing streak, which includes two road games, and the Jazz and Nets played out the first game of a three-game homestand on Monday.

The Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers all issued fines on Monday for non-attendance in December's NBA All-Star Game, which the league deemed was only a matter of time. The NBA had said it would suspend a player for a total of the 2017-18 season for failing to show up to a team meeting and for not returning to the team for the regular season. Three teams also were fined for unexplained absences after the NBA All-Star Game was held in Toronto in September. The NBA also fined the Toronto Raptors $155,000 for missing a deadline to file a legal paperwork, a situation that the league said had arisen from violations of its league-imposed policy."
387,"Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson test positive for coronavirus, sparking outrage on Twitter Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson were in a tux, but that didn't stop them from showing their fans their devotion to the public at Comic-Con. Hanks, who posed for pictures with fans in the stands during the event's closing session, was diagnosed with coronavirus earlier this month. The 57-year-old actor was infected during a recent trip to Los Angeles or a recent trip to South Africa. He told The Hollywood Reporter he's been battling the illness. Related: Tom Hanks on # MeToo and the HIV crisis ""I have to say, I've been in a tux doing a lot of things,"" he said. It was really disappointing to get infected. I mean, you do think you're immune to coronavirus, but unfortunately it doesn't. So, it was just a little bit. The Los Angeles native insisted that he's not an infected person, and that he's staying off social media. It's not the first time Hanks has been caught up in a health scare. In 2014, he issued an apology on Twitter for a Twitter message that read, ""I've been diagnosed with AIDS. I've been in a tux doing a lot of things. I'm doing a lot of things. It's a bit late to start thinking about it. I'm not in a tux. Wilson, meanwhile, told The Hollywood Reporter the first time she became infected was during an appearance at the Toronto International Film Festival. It's very unpleasant and there's really a long way to go. I had not been to a screening of ['The Ides of March'],"" she said. I looked at my watch and looked at my husband, and he goes, 'Tom, you look fine.' I was like, 'Oh wow, that's great.' Hanks said he was not in the tux for the entire screening, and he did not have special access to the rest of the audience. In October, Hanks and Wilson revealed they had contracted the virus from two people. The couple also announced that they were postponing their engagement on March 14, 2015.

388,"Lawyer defending Trump policy makes stunning admission in court A lawyer for President Donald Trump said the policy could create ""total chaos"" during his trip to South Korea this weekend, as he made a stunning admission to a federal court in Manhattan. Andrew Weissman told U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan on Thursday that Trump's travel ban could create ""total chaos,"" with the White House being made to look like it had been ""hit with a sledgehammer."" ""This is a very dangerous policy,"" Weissman said. Weissman said ""there is no question"" that the ban could have been ""thrown out of the window"" and added that ""I don't think the court has ever heard of a single administration official ever putting a person on notice"" that they cannot travel. Weissman is representing the Trump administration with the Justice Department on the case. The administration has asked Rakoff to issue a new injunction blocking the administration from issuing the proclamation because it would violate the Constitution. The executive order, part of a series of executive orders issued by the Trump administration, bans seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. and temporarily barred refugees from entering the country. Weissman said he would also be representing the State Department on the case. Weissman said he is prepared to serve as a spokesman for the Trump administration on the issue because it would be a ""terrible mistake"" to do so. ""I don't see how you can say,"" No, that was a bad decision, """" Weissman said. I don't see how to describe it as a betrayal. The travel ban is part of an ongoing legal battle between Trump and the Justice Department. The administration has argued that the travel ban violates the Constitution. President Donald Trump has said it is illegal to enter the U.S., and a group of governors from New York to Washington have joined him in challenging the ban. The case is SEC v. U.S., U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Grant McCool and Christian Plumb.

389,"This child is smiling, but her story is devastating. We don't want her to lose hope but we also want her to keep her faith and hope for a better future, maybe a brighter one. She was a beautiful, well-loved young girl. My family and I are devastated. We cannot bring her back. She was our beautiful daughter and sister, you will be greatly missed. It is thought the child's mother left for work in Newcastle but was caught and questioned by police who then took the decision to turn the child over to social services who have warned her she faces possible deportation. A spokesman from the Home Office said: ""We do not routinely comment on individual cases, but for the welfare of a child we are in direct contact with the family involved to protect their welfare. We will always work closely with local authorities to protect children from harm and take action where necessary. Police were called to a property in the village of Broughton, Gloucestershire, at around 7.20pm on Thursday. They carried out a controlled explosion at the property but were unable to locate the child. A spokesman for the child protection charity Barnardo's said:"" This is a tragic case and our thoughts are with the family at this distressing time. ""While the Home Office said it took the decision to turn the child over, the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Children and Young People, Beatrice Asselborn, said:"" This is an extremely tragic case and we are deeply concerned. ""She added:"" Parents should never be put in a position where they cannot manage the situation in which a child is held. We cannot intervene in their care and parents should not be detained without their child being properly looked after. Barnardo's has a team of volunteers on the ground in the UK to support children facing deportation who have been placed in care. A spokesperson for Barnardo's said it was investigating the case and trying to find out exactly what happened. They said: ""We work closely with local authorities and police on all cases where a child is temporarily detained as we are committed to ensuring children, who are already in foster care, receive the care and support they need. The Home Office will work with the local authority to ensure that the child receives the necessary support. We cannot comment on the causes of the child's decision to be removed but would like to thank the media for their understanding of this case and to encourage all concerned to speak to the police to assist"
390,"Bernie Sanders plans to stay in the 2020 presidential race Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is looking to remain in the presidential race in 2020. And he's already begun talking about how the process might unfold. ""It's important to me that we do not become the first party that turns out not to be the party that we need to be,"" Sanders said in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper at a Los Angeles fundraiser Monday. ""I've said consistently that we have to turn out to be the first party to win the election, to turn out to be the party that we need to be in order to have a strong economic recovery, to have a strong security,"" Sanders said. And we have to be the party that the American people actually expect us to be. ""We have to start to rebuild,"" he added.

I believe that Donald Trump has a real opportunity to move us in the right direction. I think he's got to do that, ""Sanders said. It's time for the GOP to step up and say, 'We're not going to let you down.' Sanders has been a strong critic of the GOP, and he's also been highly critical of many of Trump's policies. Sanders also said that he will be actively campaigning for a Democratic presidential candidate, and that he will be a part of the Democratic Party's ticket in the fall.""

Sanders added that he believes he'll have a third-party run in 2016. I'm not sure what the hell I'm going for. If I can't do a lot of things for you, I'm not going to be a part of it. I'm just going to keep running,"" he said."

392,"Threat of violence escalates at Greece-Turkey border as migrants drown Dozens of migrants have drowned off the coast of Turkey's Aegean coast as migrants and refugees flee a wave of violence between Turkish and Greek authorities. Turkish coast guard boats rescued 122 people off the Greek island of Lesbos on Friday and two more died on Saturday, the Turkish coastguard said in a statement. More than 43,000 migrants have landed on Greek shores so far this year. Many are fleeing a surge in violence between Turkish and Greek authorities. In the latest incident, a group of migrants died when their boat sank. It was carrying 42 people. The Turkish coast guard said its ships rescued 117 people off the coast of Lesbos on Saturday and another 10 on Sunday. A navy rescue boat arrived in the area on Saturday to search for more survivors. The latest incident comes as Germany said it would help curb the flow of migrants by providing humanitarian aid. Germany's foreign ministry said it would take responsibility for the migrants' deaths in a statement on Sunday. It added the migrants who drowned in the latest incident would be taken to a Greek port to be resettled. ""The German government will work with Greece to resettle migrants in the country,"" the statement said. The German parliament voted last year to increase the number of migrants it gave to Greece in exchange for a series of concessions. Last month, the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR said that there were fewer than 31,000 refugees in Greece last year, down from 390,000 in 2016. The European Commissioner for Migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos, told reporters that the number of people coming to Europe via Greece in 2015 was ""higher than last year."" He said the number of people arriving in Greece ""fell significantly."" This year was ""a record year"" for migrants arriving via Turkey, with more than 2 million people, he said. Meanwhile, the Greek coastguard said it had rescued 11 migrants who drowned in the Aegean on Friday. Its coastguard said the migrants were found when the boat carrying about 50 people overturned near the island of Lesbos on the Med. The survivors, all men, were taken to hospital for treatment. The rescue operation was launched at about 0500 local time (0400 GMT). The coast guard says it had rescued 10 migrants who were found in the sea. They were taken to hospital for treatment."
393,"American Dynasties: The Kennedys, CD review By Nick Collins Published: 9: 09PM BST 09 Jun 2009 American Dynasties: The Kennedys, US (Universal) The Kennedys have made great inroads into the American mainstream over the past year. In an age of US-style presidential politics, it makes sense to record these songs. The first one, American in Revolver (1963), was made by Bob Dylan and his wife, Nancy Reagan, and is, as they say, ""the first hit from the sound that made America great."" But the second is more beguiling: Bob Dylan's The Times They Are A-Changin ', whose harmonies have been a special feature of American popular music for half a century. The songs are also a reminder that, in life, all change is not inevitable and that no one can be a master of its own fate. American Dynasties are a different story altogether. They are, at times, enigmatic, driven and angry, their characters in turbulent times. Their songs are packed with rags-to-riches stories of fathers and husbands and wives, and some stories of the lives of friends and colleagues. Often, their songs touch on the political turbulences of the era; they often seem uninterested in any personal anthem: ""You are not my father,"" the one is sung by an angry child. This is a classic American song about a ""young black man,"" and a great song about a man who, according to the historian Kenneth Weiner, was a ""young black man who had the ear of the new revolutionary leader,"" the one that made the country great. It seems not much has changed since. The Kennedys show how much they still have to offer. The Kennedys: The Kennedys is released on 29 May. American Dynasties: The Kennedys are out now on Universal.

394,"Pope: The Most Powerful Man in History Pope Francis holds up a copy of the encyclical ""Perpetual Contemplation of the Faith,"" which is read before his audience during a synod at the Vatican, January 19, 2016. AP Photo / Pool VATICAN CITY -- Pope Francis was overshadowed by his wife, who was deputized as head of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics. But even by the standards of someone who has served as pope, Benedict XVI has spent much of his life representing the pope, and that was the case for Benedict XVI on Sunday. The pope was accompanied by Francis' wife, Angelica Rivera, who wore a bright red veil and a red cap to symbolize her husband's role in the Catholic Church. But on the second day of the synod, Francis appeared disinterested in the proceedings. He didn't explain why. ""What's important is that we are together,"" he said. The first question asked was whether the cardinals would endorse him for the papacy. It was the second question he declined to answer. He said he only told them in advance. The canonization is scheduled for March 5. He is expected to give a blessing and blessing speech during the ceremony. Francis has been a strong advocate of the poor, who can no longer afford the costs of living and the need to pay for the basics of a merchant's living. Some said Sunday's ceremony was the first of many. ""We need a pope who is more of a man,"" said a woman from the southern Italian town of L'Aquila, where Francis is staying to attend the synod. A second woman from the northern Italian town of Brindisi said she was not attending the ceremony but had already come for the pope, and her husband was being kept away. There was no immediate comment from the Vatican. ""He has a very delicate image, and if he doesn't have a strong image, then he can't be trusted,"" she said. He is also sensitive to the poor, which is also important during the synod. ""This is not so much a big church meeting as a religious meeting,"" said Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, who is the Vatican's secretary of state. No one in the crowd at the synod appeared to know what the pope was about to say."
395,"Louboutin wins fight to trademark red soles French shoemaker Louboutin has won the fight to trademark its red soles, in what would be the first time a shoemaker has been granted a trademark. The Paris-based luxury group had argued that the red soles, which are made of red, green and yellow, were a nod to the Swiss company's heritage. It said the ruling was ""an important step in our continued effort to regain the right to protect the heritage of its iconic brand."" The ruling, however, will not change the current trademark, which was first registered in 2009, said the group's spokesman Benoit Marini. Louboutin's red soles are famous for being fitted with over a thousand coloured soles. In 2015, the company sold 60,000 pairs, which it also claimed were ""inspired"" by the red soles. The Louboutin-made shoes, made under the company's YSL, Maje and Moschino brands, have been a staple on the catwalks for years. Louboutin said in a statement that it was ""extremely pleased"" with the court decision. ""Louboutin has always believed in its heritage, always striving to honour and respect it,"" the statement said. It said that the legal battle would ""not affect its ongoing business activities."" A court spokeswoman said the decision would be announced in September. In addition to its red soles, Louboutin has been a fashion powerhouse. In 2001, its cashmere corset and denim clothing were worn in its Paris shows, while in 2015 it launched its trademark black suede shoes. It also sells its footwear in 100 countries. Louboutin is not the first fashion house to lose a trademark battle in recent years. Earlier this month, US shoemaker Cartier, which was once owned by the Qatari royal family, filed suit against luxury fashion house Dolce & Gabbana. The owner of high-end department stores Massimo Dutti and Gucci sued in 2012, claiming it had copied the brand's name and designs. Dolce & Gabbana had already filed a lawsuit in 2014 after rival Condé Nast, owned by the publishing house, said it had copied the name of its flagship magazine. The judge in that case, who also ruled against Gap, said the US firm was not entitled to trademark the brand's name"
396,"Netflix is worth more than Disney, according to a new study That's one of the reasons the Internet company's stock price has been rising, but not quite as much as its peers. The latest report on Netflix, which is among the biggest stock market darlings, shows it's worth roughly $86.2 billion. That's a 55% increase from a year ago, and is now nearly $100 billion more than Disney. Netflix has had some impressive earnings over the past few years. On Wednesday, it reported a $9.7 billion profit for the first quarter, and that's up from $5.9 billion a year ago. For the full year, Netflix reported earnings of $2.6 billion. That's an increase over the $3.2 billion it earned in 2017, which was the first time it had ever had a profit. But the streaming service has been struggling in the U.S., where it has only had a modest response to the success of original shows like Fuller House, The Big Bang Theory and House of Cards, which have also been huge hits. Netflix has had success with original shows like Orange Is the New Black and The Crown, which have been big hits. But the company also has a number of other big hits on its plate. For example, the company recently completed a new deal with Disney, which added a fourth season to its library of original content. It's already acquired the rights to the upcoming Marvel television series, The Defenders, and Amazon's Fire TV streaming service. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, however, says the company is not feeling the burn. ""We're not feeling the burn,"" Hastings said on a conference call with reporters Thursday. We continue to grow pretty much year after year. We're not feeling the burn either. Netflix's stock has been on a tear since the company's earnings announcement on Oct.

Netflix, which also has a number of new shows on its plate, will have more than a dozen shows with multiple episodes, including Lilyhammer and The Crown. The company also has plans to add an animated series called Daredevil, which is set to premiere in 2016.

397,"Transcripts of Mr Trump's first speech, held in New York and broadcast on Fox News Channel, show him repeatedly calling Nato ""obsolete"" and saying he was ""wasting his time."" The programme also reports on the president's ""personal chemistry with Russian president Vladimir Putin"" after Mr Putin gave the Russian president a ""rather impenetrable"" gift. Mr Trump, 58, who has previously described Nato as obsolete and labelled Mr Putin ""really crazy,"" will likely face another awkward encounter with Mr Putin as he travels to Germany, where he will meet German chancellor Angela Merkel, who led the campaign to keep Nato in the global community after World War II. The president's ""very strong opinions on some things"" have made him a ""strong supporter"" of Nato, Mr Trump's national security adviser said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. I like his strong views on some things because I can't keep them in the past. I think he's made a big difference, ""the adviser said. But in a newspaper interview in early February, the president again said he was open to establishing bilateral relations with Russia, and the two leaders agreed to work together to counter the threat posed by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). However, he said he was not willing to establish a direct dialogue with Russia over the crisis in Ukraine, and insisted that Russia was a threat to national security. During his election campaign, Mr Trump publicly threatened to"" totally destroy ""North Korea if he were elected. Since then, the two leaders have largely avoided direct contact. Mr Trump said in March during an interview with Hannity that the US would attack Syria if necessary with Russia to defend its ally, Iran. At the time, the administration pledged to"" get along ""with Russia, but Mr Trump later called for a new era of cooperation with Russia, and he has since repeated his threat. The president-elect's focus on Nato has given Mr Putin a chance to showcase his military strength in the face of the new threats. In December, Russia sent fighter jets to Syria in response to a US missile strike on a Syrian airbase. Russia has repeatedly called the strike a violation of international law, which the US denies. Russia has maintained it was an act of self defence as the US-led coalition fighting IS targets in Syria carries out its air campaign. The US has been under pressure from allies, including Nato members, to step up its military presence in Syria."
398,"Transcripts emerged from a separate account of the incident in which the officers called out a question to Mr Wynn, who was responding. Mr Wynn said that he heard Mr Wheeler ""slap the (officer) in the face"" and that Mr Wheeler then pulled out a weapon in an attempt to ""break up a fight."" He was arrested and questioned before being charged on Tuesday. The officers he is accused of assaulting have not been identified. The Baltimore Police Department, which is running a misconduct investigation, has not commented on the outcome of the investigation. On Tuesday a spokesman for Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake described Mr Wynn as a ""respected police officer"" who had been with the force ""over 15 years."" The chief asked for privacy and thanked his ""family and friends."" Mr Wynn served in the US Marine Corps and the Navy. He was a member of the force for 20 years, serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has been a member of the US Marines since 2014. The Baltimore police department has been under scrutiny since the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who died in a Baltimore hospital after suffering a spinal injury on April 19. His death became a rallying cry for protests against police brutality. The death of Mr Gray, who was in a police transport van, prompted a wave of protests across the nation and led to days of demonstrations in Baltimore. Mr Wynn was a veteran of the Baltimore Police Department. He was released from the police force on December 17. The Baltimore Police Department and the US Justice Department are conducting separate investigations of the death of Freddie Gray. The Baltimore Sun reported that the department is investigating two of the officers involved in the incident. Mr Wynn has said that police officers shot him when he fell to the ground, but the medical examiner has not been able to determine the cause of death. He has been placed on paid administrative leave. ""I believe that my actions were justified because they were necessary and necessary to protect the public,"" he said. That's why I am asking for forgiveness. I'm asking for an apology. Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts released a statement on Tuesday detailing why Mr Wynn had been suspended. The department ""deeply regrets"" the incident and said it will investigate whether police officers used excessive force against Mr Wynn, the statement reads. In the meantime, we will work with the city to thoroughly investigate this matter."
399,"Transcripts of the call were recently shown to the New York Times, which also reported that Comey had asked the Justice Department to end its probe of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The Times reported that in that meeting, Comey had said the FBI had uncovered a dossier that alleged Trump's conduct was' extremely careless'. Then, on April 13, 2016, Comey told lawmakers a second email inquiry of new information had gone wrong, sending his 30,000 emails about his private calls to Trump's lawyer Lisa Page. He said the FBI was' nowhere near 'the Russia investigation, which had included allegations that the president's campaign had been colluded with Russian officials. The New York Times said at the time that the FBI had uncovered nothing wrong about the new information from the Steele dossier. On May 6, 2016 - the day the Trump campaign announced the presidential election - Comey had said in a closed hearing that Clinton should run the presidential recount. The FBI had concluded that Clinton would win the election. But on May 6, 2016, Comey told lawmakers that a recount was still being considered and Clinton would not face criminal charges. His view was later changed. In view of the FBI's substantial investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, Trump told senators:' I don't believe that you should ever rely on other people to judge the outcome of an election. 'Clinton won the White House by a landslide 306 votes to 156. After the November 2016 election, Trump told supporters in a televised victory speech:' We have one choice, and that is simple: Fall. 'He continued:' Win or lose, we will... be back. 'The election was also called a' mandate for change. 'In January 2017, Trump told lawmakers that winning the White House was the' if at all possible confidence 'he had in his judgement. He said:' The stock market has put a lot of money into the stock market. We're going to have a great White House. 'His assets are worth around $2 billion, according to CNN Library. A year later, Trump brought his assets to a peak of $735 million. He pledged to reimburse the Treasury for any payments made by Trump's personal family foundation - as well as any royalties paid from the sale of his businesses. The foundation is run by his two adult children, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump."
400,"Transcripts of police interviews with the surviving victims of the Orlando nightclub massacre do not show what happened after the gunman and wife killed 49 innocent people at the gay nightclub. Instead, the transcripts show that the couple's attempts to push Orlando out of their community and into marriage - despite repeated promises by the authorities - were fruitless. The transcripts also show that Omar Mateen, 29, was shouting 'This is for Allah,' and 'Are you with us?' as he opened fire inside Pulse nightclub on June 12, 2016. During an interview with authorities in September, Mateen said he was frustrated with the lack of attention he was getting from his ISIS-sympathizers. I don't think America has enough leadership. I don't think we're doing enough, 'Mateen told authorities at the time. Later that month, the FBI added the words' attack 'and' disaster 'to its terrorism watchlist. In May, the FBI announced that it had thwarted another potential attack by a lone wolf attacker. In that case, the terror watchlist alerted national security officials that the suspected shooter might be planning an attack in a public place within the United States that would target the FBI or any law enforcement entity. While authorities said that it was too early to tell if the attack was specifically planned for Pulse, it was an active plot and was not one that had survived previous attacks. Four co-defendants were convicted in June 2016 on charges that included aiding and abetting Mateen. Five others pleaded guilty in December 2016. Salman, who was born in Saudi Arabia, was arrested in January 2016 after her husband went to visit his grandmother in California. She later pledged allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, but has not been found guilty so far. She is being held at a federal jail in Michigan, pending her trial, which is set to begin in January. A federal judge in Detroit earlier this month overturned a $5 million bail order issued by a judge in Florida on the grounds that Salman was not following legal instructions to her husband when he killed the couple. Salman was arrested in January at her mother's home in suburban San Diego. In a previously unseen July 3, 2017, 911 call made by a dispatcher, Mateen told the operator that Mateen was' on top of me 'and that he was' going to blow me up ', according to a judge"

405,"Transcripts of some statements issued by an ex-partner could be used to prove the claimant was unlawfully killed and / or unlawfully injured. The jury heard that both Mr Wright and Mr Taylor were killed after Mr Wright rammed a post into a tree next to a number of houses in the village of Penshurst. A CCTV picture showed Mr Wright driving away from the scene where he died. Sentencing, Judge William Davis QC said: ""This is a case about an innocent and defenceless man who had no other option but to take his life and you drove him at 100mph and caused him to lose his life. You have shown no remorse or insight into your dangerous driving. He added:"" The court is satisfied that the evidence before you is sufficient to determine your sentence. ""Mr Wright's family said after the verdict:"" We are delighted that the court has spoken with us and that we can now move on from this. Nothing will bring Tom back but justice has been done. He was taken from us too soon and I would like to thank the people of Penshurst for their support. The trial, before Lord Justice Mummery and three other judges, heard that Mr Wright was convicted of causing death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving. His sister, Sharon Wright, of Penshurst, said after the verdict that she ""felt sick to my stomach."" She added: ""A lot has been done in the past 20 years in my brother's memory, and most importantly what happened that day has changed my life forever. The court has taken away his innocence and taken away the punishment he had received for killing Tom. Mr Wright had a long history of court appearances involving drink, drugs and money. The defendant claimed he had been driving at 91mph, while the figures showed that no one had ever been jailed for such a dangerous driving offence. He was also banned from driving for two years. Mr Wright's sister said:"" This verdict is the most important thing in my brother's life. We will never get justice for Tom - we will never get justice for him and now we have had a chance to put it to bed. I hope that people will consider it is not the end of the road for Tom and it is not the end of the road for me.

407,"WHO declares novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared a novel coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 630 people in Congo a global pandemic. The virus causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). In the latest outbreak, the WHO has confirmed 579 cases and killed 630 of them. In a statement, the agency said: ""As with previous outbreaks, the risk of transmission has decreased significantly,"" and called on countries to ""take appropriate measures to mitigate the risks of the spread."" The virus was first identified in Uganda and has been circulating in the country for years now. ""It is likely that our ongoing efforts will yield results in the near future,"" WHO director-general Margaret Chan said in the statement. A WHO statement said ""as of 7 October 2014, an outbreak of coronavirus known as the Sars virus in Congo continues to be traceable to a small number of confirmed cases, and is under control."" The virus has also spread through Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, neighbouring East Timor and Indonesia. Coronaviruses are not a contagious disease, but are transmitted through breathing, sneezing or coughing. A previous outbreak in the same region of central Africa last year killed 646 people and was blamed on the disease. In its latest update, WHO said: ""The last reported infections from the Sars virus in the DRC were in the DRC last year. Since then, the number of reported cases has decreased substantially, with around 1,160 cases reported and 113 deaths reported. The most recent outbreak was in August last year, when 531 cases were reported in Senegal and 118 in the DRC. In a related development, the WHO advised its member states to be on high alert for an outbreak of a new respiratory syndrome (Sars) called Mers. The virus, which has been recorded in the Middle East, Asia and Africa, has killed more than 2,050 people and sickened more than 44,000 since 2003. The disease has been traced to a cluster of viruses associated with the seasonal flu virus that emerged in the Middle East in 2000, with the virus being linked to at least 10 deaths and nearly 6,000 cases reported in Australia."
408,"Contact tracing is key to America's coronavirus strategy. What happens if it stops working well? The virus is not spread easily by people, and it can be transmitted via contact with the blood and other fluids of an infected person. The most common symptom is fever, cough, headache, and fatigue. Most deaths are caused by Guillain-Barre syndrome. The virus can be transmitted through blood-to-blood contact, or through close coughing or sneezing. There is no vaccine or treatment. ""No one knows yet how to prevent the spread of this virus,"" Dr. Richard Besser, acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told ABC News. It's just one of those things that we have not been able to stop because of the vaccine shortage. Besser said that the CDC has been asking for a vaccine for several weeks but that the vaccine was not available. Besser said there is no vaccine for the disease. However, he said that the current vaccine is good candidates for preventing Guillain-Barre syndrome. Prevention is the best strategy to prevent this. It's not always the best, ""Besser said. The CDC is looking at whether a vaccine is necessary for the disease, and it's possible a vaccine might be needed. There are currently more than 2 million doses available, but the disease is a vaccine-resistant disease and is usually preventable with a quick and simple vaccination. So if you have a fever, cough or sneeze, don't allow yourself to be infected with the virus, Besser said. It's important to have a fever vaccine.

409,"New CDC guidance says older adults should 'stay at home as much as possible' due to coronavirus outbreak New guidance calls for the elderly to ""stay at home as much as possible"" this summer should a new outbreak of the winter vomiting bug emerge. Doctors at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are urging older adults to avoid visiting friends and family during the winter months. In a tweet, CDC Director Tom Frieden outlined the updated advice that states should also be aware of the ""persistent risk"" of the disease. ""It's a serious disease, but we know it works,"" Frieden said. We have seen a lot of people get sick and die. There is no vaccine or treatment for the virus, and the CDC recommends that older adults continue to stay home and avoid contact with their friends and family when they come into contact with someone sick. Still, experts said the new guidelines should be taken seriously, and the elderly should be aware of the risks of contracting the disease. ""I think there is a lot of misinformation out there right now,"" said Dr. Janet Woodworth, an infectious disease specialist at Columbia University Medical Center in New York who was not involved with the new advice. ""It's really important that we be on the lookout for these things,"" Woodworth said. Currently, there is no vaccine or treatment for the disease. And due to the lack of federal funding for the disease, researchers have little hope of achieving the goal of eliminating the virus in the U.S. Woodworth said parents and caregivers should also be aware of the virus' presence. ""Because we know it's prevalent in individuals, they need to be aware of it,"" she said. The CDC recommends people at risk for the virus get tested for the first time, or if they go to their doctor, to identify the infection. The new guidelines come as the agency is trying to reassure Americans that it's working on a vaccine as well as an antibody to avoid the virus spreading during the winter. The CDC is also working on developing vaccines specifically to prevent the virus from spreading between people. The agency also is working on a vaccine to prevent people with severe acute respiratory syndrome, including influenza, from becoming infected with the bug. People can protect themselves by wearing long sleeves and long pants and using a mask or face masks."
410,"Former CDC director: It's time to restrict visits to nursing homes By Leslie Tamura Washington Post Staff Writer Friday, February 11, 2011; 7: 13 PM The Obama administration has proposed suspending federal payments to nursing homes to lower costs, and the president has said that future payments should be tied to the health care overhaul law that is gaining traction in Congress. But Richard Titley, director of the National Center for Health Statistics, said the proposal goes too far and could slash economic activity. Titley said it would be counterproductive to reduce the health savings that nursing homes receive from Medicare or Medicaid. ""You have to look at the costs of not having people in those health care systems,"" Titley said in an interview. In fact, he said, the number of people getting emergency care through Medicare and Medicaid dropped after Republicans in the House and Senate passed their version of the health care overhaul Wednesday. ""It doesn't make sense to be paying more to Medicare than Medicaid or anything like that, because Medicare is not like that,"" he said. Under the new proposal, states could apply for an exemption from the cuts, which could affect more than 30 million people. States typically use the money they receive from Medicare and Medicaid to cover all of their costs for the elderly. Citing studies that have shown that people who get emergency care from the federal government spend far more overall on healthcare than those who do not, Titley said the savings could be used to pay for additional social services for the elderly. The American Nurses Association, the largest union for nursing homes, said in a written statement that its members understand the scope of the problem. ""We have long supported the creation of an entitlement that benefits all seniors at low cost,"" said David W. Reynolds, the association's president. But we think this approach is a step too far and we urge the administration to recognize that this is not the best use of taxpayer dollars. The association said it also would encourage all states to act to reduce access and decrease costs. ""We recognize that reduced access to care is the only way to reduce health care costs, and that changes could be more cost effective in these programs,"" Reynolds said. But he added that the association ""is concerned"" about the potential impact of the proposal on care quality. ""We have concerns about the impact on quality,"" Reynolds said. We have concerns about the potential impact on quality."
411,"America faces a new normal as coronavirus outbreaks show no sign of slowing down The virus is believed to have been contracted as a result of a new strain of the virus that has hit Europe in recent weeks. If confirmed, the outbreaks would be the worst since 2003 and put a massive strain on the National Health Service. The World Health Organisation said on Tuesday the current outbreak had been ""contained."" ""What is clear is that the current outbreak in the Middle East and North Africa is not over,"" said Dr Margaret Chan, director-general of the WHO. There is still a lot of work to be done but we now have a clear picture of what is at risk. There is no clear pandemic. There may still be one or two cases in at least ten countries but that is not ideal. We would like to see a rapid response to this outbreak so that we can stop it from spreading further. The current wave of outbreaks began in Europe and the US last week, and spread quickly through countries such as the UK, Spain and France. The virus is most commonly transmitted through direct contact with infected mosquitoes, but scientists believe the strain involved in these outbreaks is the same as that which has ravaged Brazil and France in recent years. A number of people in Brazil and Spain have been confirmed to have contracted the virus, with the suspected victims in both countries being young children. In the US, a man who contracted the virus while visiting family in California has died and four others are in hospital. In the UK, a case of swine flu was confirmed at a primary school, but the number of cases has now risen to 19. The outbreak was first identified in Mexico and was believed to have originated in Guinea. It is thought that the virus was re-emerging in the Americas from Mexico in early September. The World Health Organisation emphasised that any outbreaks being reported in the world's largest economy and leading producer of oil could have ""catastrophic implications"" for the global economic recovery. In a statement, the WHO said: ""The situation in the world economy has deteriorated severely and the situation in countries such as the US is of grave concern."" It added: ""While we have seen relatively minimal outbreaks, there is a high risk of a pandemic and other global health risks resulting from the virus."" Scientists believe that infectious diseases like Ebola, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)"
412,"Worried about coronavirus? If your loved one is over 60, read this... In a high-risk area, the CDC recommends that anyone over 60 who has recently traveled to a country with local transmission of the virus get tested for coronavirus. The CDC says that those travelers may need to stay away for 72 hours after getting their first dose. The danger is, even if you're ill, your illness will spread through the air -- and it's possible the virus could mutate. ""Though the virus is common in Africa, it is most often transmitted by mosquitoes from someone who traveled to countries where it is prevalent,"" says the CDC. So if you are a person who has been in or living in an infected area, or who has traveled by air to an infected area, you're not likely to have been exposed to the virus. With more cases, it's important to keep your partner, family member or health care provider informed. In addition to being vaccinated for the virus, you and your partner can get a free flu shot if you have an extended family member or family member with the virus. Other important steps you can take to protect yourself include washing your hands frequently and using tissues, staying home from work and regularly changing nappies and linens. If you should develop symptoms, contact your doctor immediately. The CDC says that if you experience any symptoms, seek medical attention immediately. For more information on the CDC's new vaccine information, see the CDC's website. To learn more about the CDC's new vaccine information, visit the CDC's website, click here. The CDC says that you should never, ever take a contraceptive, but that if you do, ""you shouldn't make a concerted effort to get pregnant,"" as the virus may be getting under your skin. The CDC says that women should ""protect themselves against all of the viruses that are circulating in the community"" by using condoms and avoiding sharing or sharing personal items with any family members who may have been exposed. You should also protect your spouse, sexual partners, or other loved ones from the virus. In addition to protecting your loved ones, people who may have had contact with people who are sick should wash their hands often, use tissues and cover their hands when they cough or sneeze. And, if you have had contact with someone who is sick,"

The report, called World Sleep Day, is an annual event launched last year to remind the public about what is needed to bring people together to sleep better in the real world. Here are 10 commandments (or 10) from some of the most trusted people in the world. ""Don't let the sleep deprivation interfere with your daily life,"" says the World Sleep Council. Use the time we have and enjoy those precious moments so we can enjoy the rest of your life. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Give yourself a good night's sleep. Don't let other people's problems interfere with your life. Use a positive attitude toward yourself and your life. Give yourself a break from the world. Take a break from the world.

416,"Coronavirus myths and misinformation, debunked in viral myth survey A new viral myth about coronavirus has come under fire. People think they are infected with the deadly infection when they diagnose it and avoid touching their hands, nose or mouth, the study found. But the reality is often untrue, a study by the University of York has found. The team found that ""myths and misinformation"" about the illness ""can often be misleading, and often misleading."" The study, published in the medical journal BMC Medicine, examined the evidence and found that 85% of people questioned thought that people in different countries in the world were infected by coronaviruses. ""Most of the myths and misinformation about coronavirus have been discredited,"" the study said. Most people in the UK believe that it is perfectly harmless and is not dangerous. But in reality, many people believe that it can cause severe illness and serious illness, or even death. However, when you consider that the majority of people in the world contracted the virus when they visited a hospital in the UK, people believe that they know what the symptoms of coronavirus are. People may be misled into thinking they are infected by sharing a bed with someone who might have it. It's important that people be aware of the signs and symptoms of coronavirus and the risks of contracting them, and so that they can ensure that they are not infected. The study involved researchers in the UK, France, Italy, Singapore, Thailand, Japan and the US. Dr John Brilliant, who led the study, said: ""Many people believe that the virus can cause mild illness and death, but we have not found evidence for this. When people think about coronaviruses, they often think they are infectious and can cause severe illness and death. However, when they think about the viruses themselves, they often think that they are not infectious. Coronaviruses can cause illness in people by breaking down the walls of the respiratory fluid, making it more difficult to get to the coughs and colds that cause the infection. In a review article accompanying the study, Coronavirus expert Professor Andrew Weaver said that even in countries where there were few cases of infection, people should take steps to avoid contracting the virus."" If you think you have the virus you should contact your GP"
417,"Here's what this US coronavirus survivor in Seattle learned when she was sick and how to stay infectiously clean in an effort to survive a dangerous new strain. Here are some ways to protect yourself from the coronavirus: Make sure you're on a plane, hotel or anywhere where people are sick. If you're in public places, do not share a couch or other personal items, such as food. Keep your home clean and close, even when you're sick. If you're sick, call your doctor to get tested, either for the virus or for an unrelated illness. Make sure you check your temperature, stay home from work, use the restroom and change your diapers. If you do not feel well, ask your doctor to check again for the virus or an illness. If you are sick, get out of the area and call your doctor. When you are ill, call your doctor to get testing done. If you're feeling unwell, call your doctor to get testing done. If you will be hospitalized and need to be treated, get the flu shot, because you want the flu shot. Don't be afraid to get tested. If you or someone you love has symptoms of the flu, get tested. If you need to see your doctor, call your doctor right away. If you don't feel well, don't get tested. If you're sick, get your flu shot. You'll likely get a flu shot, and the flu shot will give you the lowest chance of getting the flu. You really shouldn't have to be afraid to get tested. The flu shot is the best way to protect yourself. Ask your doctor about the flu shot. If you have a cold or a high fever, look at your doctor for the seasonal flu shot. If you are pregnant, get the flu shot. You can be vaccinated for the flu if you feel better. But if you are sick, get the shot when the flu is more severe. It will also give you a stronger immune system and allow other people to be sick. If you are sick, get vaccinated. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about getting the flu shot. If you think you do not have the flu shot, you should contact your doctor. You can also find a free flu shot app or contact your doctor at the local emergency room or their local office. The CDC provides a free flu shot app for individuals, families, and caregivers."
418,"Fish oil supplements linked to lower risk of heart disease and death, study finds Fish oil supplements have been linked to lower risk of heart disease and death, US researchers found. The US Food and Drug Administration made the revelation on April 1, 2016. Related: Scientists find omega 3 fatty acids may help lower risk of coronary heart disease Men taking fish oil supplements had a lower risk of having a heart attack or stroke, according to a study published in the journal Circulation. The placebo effect was better in people who took fish oil compared with those who did not, the study said. The FDA classifies ""fish oil"" as an omega 3 fatty acid that has no effect on heart health. The supplements are a powerful source of omega 3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, oily fish, green vegetables, such as salmon, mackerel, sardines and prawns, and in high-fat dairy products such as soy milk, egg yolks and whole grains. If you are taking fish oil, eat fish a few hours before meals and limit saturated fats to about 16% of your diet a day, or you can limit your intake of processed meat and limit your intake of saturated fats, too. You should also try to get at least two litres a day of omega 3 fatty acids, especially if you already have diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol. The Alzheimer's Association, the British Dietetic Association, and the American Heart Association all advise against taking fish oil supplements. Drinking green vegetables and fish on a daily basis is known to reduce the amount of omega-3 fatty acids that can be absorbed by the brain. The study had been conducted in rats, and the data does not prove that omega-3 fatty acids cause a decreased risk of heart disease or death. The researchers are now investigating the effect of omega 3 fatty acids on blood levels of the brain in the brain. They have a small number of adult rats and have not been able to assess how long the supplements lasted. The US fish oil industry is currently analysing the results of the study on humans, and will begin to conduct further trials. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently regulates the use of fish oil supplements."
419,"Your waist size may be more important than weight for multiple heart attack risk factors like high blood pressure and diabetes, experts suggest. While a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that being overweight or obese raises the risks of heart attack, it also raises the risk of developing other heart-related problems, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. ""There are a lot of things that are related to obesity,"" said Dr. Suzanne Jin, a cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City and medical director of the Cardiovascular Valve Program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""For example, the diet high in saturated fat is associated with more heart risk,"" Jin said. You need to be overweight or obese, and it means that you have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Keep in mind that the risk of heart disease, stroke, or type 2 diabetes increases from the waist down, according to Jin. And, while weight loss and exercise are a good thing for your heart, exercise doesn't mean you're going to go out and get healthy. ""When we're eating healthy, we're trying to avoid weight gain or increase the risk of obesity,"" said Jin. And that is what we're doing. Your cardiovascular risk is raised with exercise, but the researchers cautioned that the study cannot definitively answer the reasons in favor of the heart disease risk factors.

420,"Avoid these five risk factors and live longer, study says 28, 2013 - These five risk factors are linked to a higher mortality risk for individuals in Australia and can result in a lower quality of life to those in the general population. Photo: Angela Wylie While the researchers found no association between the risk factors and mortality, certain lifestyle factors and the health of Australian people was associated with a significant risk of mortality. Dr Mark Robinson, Associate Professor at Curtin University's School of Health Sciences and the School of Health Sciences, said while it was clear there were other health risks involved in the Australian population, individuals living in regional areas or the Northern Territory tended to be more health prone than those in the rest of Australia. ""These characteristics may influence how Australians live and die, but are not necessarily shared with others,"" he said. People living in regional areas in particular may be at greater risk of various health complications including chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking and having high blood pressure. The team conducted follow-up research into 53,575 men and women aged between 55 and 75 in Australia, and measured the health of their physical and mental health, lifestyle, and other lifestyle factors. They examined the relationship between lifestyle factors, including cardiovascular disease risk, smoking, alcohol consumption, smoking and alcohol consumption. The researchers found that men with a higher risk of premature death but who had greater physical activity were more likely to die. This was in addition to the risk of cardiovascular disease. The study was published in the International Journal of Epidemiology. The research was supported by the federal Health Research and Quality Agency. Dr Robinson said it was important to find ways to address these risk factors. ""The overall message is that we need to ensure that individuals living in regional and rural areas are protected from the negative health impacts of lifestyle factors and that they are supported to achieve their health objectives,"" he said. That means ensuring the population is able to live healthier lifestyle choices through improved health outcomes, more exercise and a healthy lifestyle.

421,"Year-long resolutions don't work. Here's how to make 12 'micro-resolutions' instead of one Another tip from Dr Chan, is to tackle your 'micro-resolutions' with the same goal.'You can't just make the habit of being active all your life, 'he said. Use micro-habits to work every day. Just think of it as an adventure. Rather than going to the gym every day, work out for 20 minutes every day instead of just 15, and you'll get incredible results.' Dr Chan suggests having a few goals in mind if you want to achieve them, and says it's also better to start early to avoid putting off any ambitions. Although this may sound like a hard sell not to the average gym-goer, it's easy to see how something as simple as a 30 minute walk each day can transform your body. With such a small amount of activity you can begin to 'see the bigger picture' and aim to build those new habits, the study found. The findings were published in the journal Appetite. Commenting on the study, Dr Sarah Schenker of Prevention Research said: 'This study shows that the best way to keep your habits in check is to get outside and exercise. It is also important to choose high intensity exercise, which can be done on a regular basis or when you are working out more regularly. These simple exercises can be done at home or in the office - and people can get their activity levels back up by hitting their daily target. According to the NHS, an individual's health should be weighed up against their own health, and there is good evidence that exercise can make a big difference to our overall health. Exercise is good for our heart, and good for our brain too, so it's never too late to make that switch, either.' For more information, visit the GP.

422,"Exercise advice on food labels could help reduce obesity, researchers say 4, 2013 - People who exercise may help reduce obesity and the risks that it poses to the health of the population, according to an analysis of food labels published in the International Journal of Obesity. Researchers from the University of Michigan have found that the presence of labels on food, and other foods, impacts the level of activity, which may contribute to obesity. If it is not an environment that people exercise, then the ability to exercise may be impaired. ""We are able to say that this diet contributes to obesity,"" said Professor Joseph L. Smith, assistant professor of psychiatry at Michigan. It will not only affect the risk of obesity, it also affects the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. A diet containing a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet has been shown to reduce the risk of certain cancers. The researchers found that in some ways, those people who used labels on food, such as ""fish, meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy,"" were more likely to develop obesity, but that the link did not extend to other types of food containing carbohydrates. The research shows that identifying lifestyle factors influencing fat and carbohydrate content does not provide enough information to inform consumers about the risks associated with eating carbohydrates, the authors said. ""People who exercise are not contributing to obese people and there is no evidence that they are,"" said Dr. David B. M. Steil, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral biology at the University of Michigan. Our study shows that it's best to ask people about their diet before they eat any foods, and we hope this information is useful for consumers.

423,"What this sunny, religious town in California teaches us about living longer -- ScienceDaily Just about every place in the United States has a winery, a business or a college. And yet we're in the midst of a housing crisis, so what does this town teach us about living longer? A new paper, published in the September issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, presents a case study in a study of more than 1,000 Californians aged 9-11 living in a low-income and rural location. The researchers looked at over 600 U.S. families living in a two-family home and found that the majority of the homes were built without a typical owner's permission. The homes ranged in size from about 160 square feet, to nearly 900 square feet, making them suitable for low-income families. They also noted that for most of the families, the homes were built in the high-end style, with larger windows with outdoor living areas. ""It is important to note that people are going to be affected by the housing crisis as well as be surprised to learn that their homes are designed to accommodate people of a low socioeconomic status,"" said lead author Dr. Edward Miller, a pediatric neurologist at University of California San Francisco. Miller is an expert on adult living. This study is part of a larger study of the region. ""We have more questions than answers,"" Miller said. There is a need for more research and more research. Many of the residents of the homes were between the ages of 7 and 11, according to the study. One of the researchers, Dr. Stephanie J. Opportjens, a professor in UC San Diego Department of Medicine and director of the university's Center for the Study of Long Term Care, said the findings were not surprising since many of the people living in the homes have lived in poverty for decades. ""The real problem was that people were living in poor-quality homes with a bad roof,"" Opportjens said. One of the biggest issues that we want people to remember is that there is a good deal of poverty in the country. There are families where they can't afford basic necessities like food and gasoline and are living in poverty. ""They need to understand what the challenges are and what the potential problems are,"" said Opportjens. We can't do that on a daily basis."
424,"Does having boys or girls run in families? New study says it's down to chance By Erin McLaughlin updated 10: 19 a.m. Does having two or three boys or girls run in families? What about having more girls in your family? Those are just some of the questions being asked in a new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The survey found that about 8 percent of U.S. adults have three or more boys, and that about 4 percent have four or more girls. The percentage of girls who have two or more boys ranges from 49 percent to 46 percent, according to the study. Only about 5 percent of men and 3 percent of women had more than one boys. The report also found that men were more likely than women to have twins and fewer are having daughters in preschool. In addition, men also are more likely than women to have twins, with two in every three men having twins while the same number of women have girls. The CDC is releasing an updated version of the survey to help researchers gauge the prevalence of obesity among the general population. CDC researchers said the study could help provide an early warning for the growing number of Americans who are trying to lose weight or become healthy. The survey was conducted by the agency between Oct. 30 and Nov. ""These data suggest that we need to do a better job of tracking these numbers as we progress over time,"" CDC senior director Thomas Frieden said in a statement. Among children, about half had two or more boys and girls. Among women, about 55 percent had more than one boys, although the percentage of black babies has increased slightly. About 56 percent of black babies had two or more boys. The percentage of black girls who had two or more boys grew slightly, from 45 percent in 2007 to 47 percent in 2008. The percentage of black girls who had four or more boys rose from 32 percent to 47 percent. The percentage of white girls who had two or more boys was steady at 16 percent. The percentage of white boys who had two or more boys dropped to 19 percent from 31 percent in 2007. The percentage of black girls who had two or more boys rose from 12 percent to 12 percent, while the percentage of black girls who had one or more boys rose from 19 percent to 23 percent. The percentage of black boys who had one or more boys rose from 5 percent to 13 percent. The percentage of black girls who had two or more boys rose from 13 percent to 18 percent."
425,"A later bedtime linked with obesity for children under 6, study says NEW YORK, May 23 (UPI) --Researchers at the University of Michigan found children who received bedtime routines more than three hours earlier than those who receive the same dose of sleep at night are at higher risk of obesity and children's higher rates of diabetes. The study is the first to establish causation for sleep deprivation during childhood, the researchers said. They surveyed more than 3,000 children ages 6 to 12 in Michigan who had participated in the Michigan Children's Healthcare Study from 2006-2011. The study participants were a sample of children who were between 6 and 6 years old and were randomly assigned to receive bedtime routines. They were given a bedtime schedule and told to go to bed at an average of 4 a.m. The researchers, led by Professor Scot Vinson, found children whose parents had not received bedtime routines the same or above a recommended amount of sleep had higher rates of waist circumference and waist circumference. Children who received bedtime routines at 4 a.m. had an 8.7 times greater risk of obesity than children who did not receive bedtime routines at 4 a.m., the study said. Children who received bedtime routines at 5 a.m. had a 7.9 times higher waist circumference. ""We do not find cause and effect, but it is reassuring that these studies demonstrate that at age 6, children who receive bedtime routines at 4 a.m. have a higher risk of obesity and diabetes,"" study author Dr. Gregory E. Morin said in a statement. This is especially important for children whose parents do not receive bedtime routines. The study was published in the journal Pediatrics. ""There is no single measure of the health and health consequences of sleep deprivation,"" said Dr. Paul Van Allen, director of the Adolescent Health and Research Center at the University of Michigan. It is important to get enough sleep and that children stay regularly asleep. That is the direction that the research should go along with evaluating the effectiveness of early childhood health services. The longer sleep children are asleep, the more often they will have diabetes. ""Getting enough sleep has been shown to promote improved health, with greater intra-school enrollment and, more importantly, improvement in health outcomes,"" Morin said. Future research should look at the impact of bed dissatisfaction on obesity and diabetes prevalence."

The study was published in the journal Child Development. ""Social media use can affect a child's self-esteem,"" Dr Nadeau said. Consequently, it can lead to greater negative health consequences and affect mental health, especially for teenagers who are stressed, unsure where to engage in activities or who are more likely to engage in social media. But we need to know more about how social media impact mental health and whether it can lead to any longer-term decrease in mental health. Dr Nadeau's team used socio-demographic data to examine social media use among 860 seventh and 12th graders at four schools in Ohio. The children were asked to complete the surveys twice a week for three months. Participation in the surveys was analysed over the first half of the year. All of the children told researchers that they had used social media in the past, including during the early years of their lives and in the days after they began school. The researchers found that children who used social media at least twice a week after school were at increased risk of psychological problems, including depression, anxiety and anxiety. Dr Nadeau said: ""Social media use can affect a child's mental health and can have long term consequences for mental health and the development of mental health problems. We need to know more about how social media impacts mental health and may lead to short-term effects on mental health, such as depression and anxiety. This is particularly important for children who are struggling with everyday life. The US National Institute of Mental Health has more on digital use. The study's lead author, Dr Michelle Rains, said:"" Having social media access at school is important because it allows pupils to socialise and open up options that may improve their mental health. ""The authors also found that children who used social media at least once a week were more likely to report difficulties in school and to have depressive or anxiety."
428,"Vaping: What's a parent to do? At the end of the day, kids are young and they have nothing to do with it. But there are lots of different things you can do to protect your child. So go ahead and smoke, or get some exercise. It's not illegal in California, but it's illegal to smoke. If you don't like it, go to the gym. And then, when you're done, take a walk. After all, tobacco smoke is the most common form of tobacco use in the U.S., with more than 2 million people daily exposed to it. Smoking is the second-leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. It's also the second-leading cause of premature death in the United States, behind cancer. ""Parents can lead a healthy lifestyle with plenty of time to enjoy their children's passions of sport and music,"" Dr. George L. Vaccaro, director of the Center for Tobacco-Free Kids at Saint Louis University, said in a press release. But parents should also be aware that tobacco smoke is deadly for your unborn child. For those of you who love your kid, your health is particularly important. But if you or someone you love will be affected by this, a child's health is really at risk. Parents can make a difference by making healthy choices around tobacco use. They can also set up an anonymous tip line at www.cdc.gov. We're committed to help prevent tobacco use around the world and give kids and teens access to safe and effective tobacco products. This is not a partisan issue. We are deeply committed to helping our fellow Americans reduce their exposure to tobacco smoke and to protecting the health of our children. We are currently in the final stages of raising awareness about the risks of tobacco use and the challenges we face every day. We're committed to working with all of our stakeholders to support a safer future for our families and loved ones. SOURCE: bit.ly / 1bbXGM4 Tobacco Control, online March 25, 2014.

429,"Leukemia: Could germ-free childhoods could trigger illness? A new study suggests a new technique could be on the way to treat leukemia -- but only if they are able to kill the leukemia cells themselves. A new study, published in the Journal of Leukemia, suggests a new technique could be on the way to treat leukemia. Researchers from Case Western Reserve University's Center for Regenerative Medicine analyzed two groups of patients who were treated with a drug with a protein called MTOR-1. The therapy essentially kills the leukemia cells themselves, but it is thought it could be effective in other cancers, like lymphoma. ""This is not a new treatment,"" said Dr. Jonathan Lundgren, who led the research. But this is the first study by a large-scale study to show that, for the first time, it does not work. Lundgren said the approach has a high death rate, which may mean that it may not work in patients with other types of cancer. ""It is possible that the enzyme that it is designed to target will be involved in the destruction of cancer cells,"" Lundgren said. We have no firm evidence that this is feasible. If this works, Lundgren and his colleagues would like to take this step. ""The enzyme is highly selective,"" Lundgren said. If we can engineer its destruction by inducing the cell to grow with the cancer, then we've made it possible to destroy the cancer with this enzyme. We now want to see if this is feasible. Currently, there is no approved treatment for the illness. But MTOR-1 is being investigated as a treatment for cancer. The researchers believe it may be possible to use the protein to kill cancer cells before they are too toxic to kill. By putting the stem cells back in the tumor, they believe they can destroy the leukemia cells themselves. Lundgren's team is currently testing the effect of MTOR against a different type of cancer, lymphoma, and researchers are hoping that this approach will become a standard treatment in the future. ""We're optimistic that it will not be just a standard treatment,"" Lundgren said. For the next decade or so, this will be the standard treatment and we'll see if it has a similar effect."
430,"Partial e-cigarette 'flavor ban' goes into effect today. Here's what happens next. We start with Bloomberg's ""Q & A"" on Tuesday. Bloomberg is saying he will announce a ban on smoking in the state of New Mexico, where about 40 percent of the adult population lives. The move would be the first nationwide ban on smoking in public. Here's Friday's agenda on Bloomberg's website. Here's a look at the full list of other states, plus some other ways to keep smokers from lighting up on Monday afternoon. On October 3, Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico announced a ban on smoking in public places, in a sign she's eyeing a possible run for president in 2016. About 300 public health experts met in New Mexico to consider the possible health effects of e-cigarettes. California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill making it illegal to sell e-cigarettes to minors on Monday. It's the latest of several states that have banned e-cigarettes. Here's an excerpt from the meeting, in Spanish: The message from the governor is that e-cigarettes are dangerous. It's dangerous. It's the dangerous product of people who want to become addicted to smoking. It's the wrong product for everyone. In the state of New Mexico, governor Susana Martinez is expected to sign a bill into law this week banning e-cigarettes in public places. This is her first state ban and the first in New Mexico. Here's a roundup of the day's developments: California has the most ""nicotine-related"" smokers in the country, according to a new report. The authors of the report, ProCocaine Research, call e-cigarettes a ""product that is intended to lead to dependence and addiction."" Researchers at the California Institute of Technology and the University of California at Davis have found that the nicotine can also lead to the development of cancers, diabetes and other health problems. The study was conducted by researchers in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. The study will be published in the journal Cell Metabolism. It's a good idea to check your e-cigarette's heat control and other potential risks with your e-cigarette, but you should keep your cessation device handy. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences will hold a meeting on nicotine on Monday."
431,"US life expectancy climbs for first time in four years US life expectancy has climbed for the first time in four years, with the US population now expected to reach 84.5 years, according to new federal figures released on Wednesday. The Office of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the US for the first time in 2012 had a lower life expectancy than the World Health Organization and US Census Bureau estimated, as the US population grew faster than any other large developed economy. The change was the result of a rise in global population and an ageing population, the CDC said. It was the first time since 1991 that the US was living longer, according to the CDC. The US population aged 15 to 64 today is expected to hit 85.1 years and then 96.6 years and then 97.1 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control. A US life expectancy of 81.4 years was based on forecasts from the World Health Organisation, which said the absolute number of people who would have lived to age 100 by 2051 would be 84.6 million. But the US population is expected to grow another 1.9 million people, compared with a predicted expansion of 1.6 million, according to the CDC. The US population is expected to reach 91.8 million in 2051, around 8.5 percent of the US population, according to the CDC. The US is expected to meet the original forecast in 2053 - the year the first world war to end - with an extra 1.7 million people and an extra 50.8 million in 2069, according to the CDC. The US population is expected to reach 95.8 million in 2069, eight percent of the US population, according to the CDC. The report said the US population is expected to reach 85.8 million in 2071, one percent higher than the current population. In total, there were 89.6 million people at the end of 2012, 41.6 percent of the US population. ""Our findings indicate that the US population is healthier, safer, and more productive than we could have predicted,"" said Dr David Acheson, chairman and chief scientific officer of the CDC. ""Without these positive trends, it is hard to predict the future of the American Health Care system,"" said CDC Director Tom Frieden. We are now well on the way toward a healthier, safer future for the American people."
432,"The mystery of President Trump's unannounced hospital visit The man who invited President Donald Trump to his New Jersey hospital was indeed there. Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States, was at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, in November for the annual military hospital checkup, according to a tweet by White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders. During the visit the president is thought to have been admitted to the hospital for ""routine check-ups"" but has remained at home. The news broke on Monday after the President's official Twitter account tweeted: ""Thank you @ nvdw for the visit & look forward to continuing to lean on @ StateDept & @ USMC for the health of our Military & our great people!"" The White House confirmed the visit to reporters at the time. Trump was joined by his wife Melania, son Donald Trump Jr, and daughter Ivanka, the senior adviser. Last month, the President's son attended a party at Trump Tower. Last year, the president held a joint news conference with the French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House. During the event, Macron recounted Trump's visit to France after the Paris terror attacks. In a follow-up tweet, the US president said: ""France cannot be beaten & we must defeat radical Islamic terrorism. We must never let ISIS win. The White House, however, claimed it was"" not insignificant ""that the President's visit was a"" routine ""one. It was an emergency. We were there on a routine trip. It was never mentioned that he was coming to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center,"" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. Trump has been hospitalised several times for suspected medical problems in the past. He was treated for pneumonia in August 2016 and also had a benign brain tumour removed in May 2017. This is not the first time that Trump has been hospitalised for medical issues. Back in June, President Trump was hospitalised for two days after suffering what his office called a mild bout of pneumonia. He had spent four days in hospital. In January, a White House spokesperson confirmed that Trump had been admitted again for tests and would remain in the hospital for ""a number of days."" The President was rushed to Walter Reed for a routine physical and was later discharged. The President spent a few days at the White House in February after spending a month in the hospital following a heart attack."

Gupta thinks it's a dangerous and dangerous practice, that it needs to be regulated and regulated by the drug courts to make sure people can get it legally. Gupta said it's important that doctors have the ability to prescribe a medical marijuana product, ""but we also have to regulate the product because that's how it's intended to be sold to the public."" Gupta says there needs to be an ""intensive dialogue"" between doctors, pharmacists and patients with marijuana in order to regulate the substance, and that patients with severe or debilitating illnesses could be dispensed some form of medicine for medical purposes. ""What we need to be doing is educating everybody that medical marijuana is not going to be used for, well, medicinal purposes,"" Gupta said. One of the things to do, is educate people that medical marijuana is not intended to be used for, well, medicinal purposes, and we have to regulate the product because that's how it's supposed to be sold to the public Gupta says people should discuss with their doctors the consequences of using the drug and how it might affect their health. ""What we also need to be doing is educating everybody that medical marijuana is not intended to be used for, well, medicinal purposes, and we have to regulate the product because that's how it's intended to be sold to the public,"" Gupta said. Gupta said people who are addicted to the drug should not be allowed to use it, as it puts them in a more destructive place. ""We need to give them support, and sometimes they would feel like, for the first time in their lives that's kind of out of their control,"" Gupta said. Gupta said there needs to be a dialogue between doctors and patients about marijuana. ""But just to give them some kind of sense of, you know, what is the medical use of marijuana?"" he said.

434,"Sit, stand, sit: The new science about how to best use your standing desk The best way to sit down, stand and move is by doing this: Instead of sitting down, sit facing your desk. That's the recommendation from British researchers who say sitting down is the best way to better help you to stay upright. Led by Professor Hugh Pennington, of the University of Manchester's School of Sport Sciences, they studied the influence of standing on our ability to move on our own. Their study, published in the journal PLOS ONE and presented at the Association for Psychological Science (ASSP) annual meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, shows how sitting down is essential to our ability to move on over time. And it's not just a matter of sitting down. Standing up reduces your risk of falls, and also reduces the risk of developing a heart condition that could affect patients over time, ""says Professor Pennington. The study found that people who stood up for 12 hours a day increased their risk of suffering a stroke, heart failure, or having a heart attack by seven per cent. But standing up meant those who had walked for more than an hour five days a week had a 10 per cent lower risk of stroke, cardiovascular disease and a three per cent lower risk of heart failure. In addition, people who walked for more than an hour five days a week had a nine per cent lower risk of stroke, and were also four times more likely to die from heart disease."" Losing just a little bit of movement can reduce your risk of stroke and heart failure, ""adds Professor Pennington. He told the ASSP conference that as exercise is important for many people, standing up will be important for many more. One in three to one adults in the UK is sedentary, and this is expected to rise to one in ten in the next 20 years. And although this increases the risk of stroke, a small study carried out by the Stroke Association showed that sitting down did not make a huge difference to lower risk of stroke. The research showed those who stood for more than an hour five days a week increased their risk of stroke by six per cent. But even after taking into account age, sex and obesity, sedentary behaviour was not associated with any change in stroke risk. The study found that people who walked for an hour five days a week increased their risk of stroke, heart failure and a three per cent lower risk of heart failure"
435,"Not all screen time causes kids to underperform in school, study says April 13 (UPI) -- A study by the University of Southern California found that watching a screen while learning a new skill can cause children to perform poorly in school. The research, published Thursday in the Journal of Adolescent Health, found children who watched movie-quality TV while learning to read were less likely to be ready for school compared to those watching a real-life educational program. In fact, children who watched TV while learning a new skill were more likely to be better prepared for school. ""The more engaged a child is in school, even when watching a non-educational program, the less likely they are to perform at school,"" lead researcher Meg Ho said in a press release. Researchers analyzed data on 40,733 students from the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics to find how much screen time children spent with their teachers, family or peers during the year. Researchers found that the more engaging a child was in school, the less likely a child was to perform worse in school compared to their peers. The study showed children who watched more screen time were more likely to be overweight, obese and not in school or learning any new information about being a student. The study also revealed many television programs were unsuitable for youngsters. ""Television is a very basic media, and it is not a way to help children learn or to improve their education,"" Ho said. Our findings suggest that it could be a critical factor in developing positive student behavior in schools and in our society. We've found that engaging children with a variety of programming, videos and tools may prevent them from performing at school. The study didn't test the effects of screen time on students who watched a real-life educational program but rather to see how they responded to a non-educational program. Researchers plan to measure how students respond to educational programs during the following two years and then compare results for each program. Ho is a professor of psychology at USC. She told USA Today the study was similar to one that looked at the impact of viewing a TV program on kids' brain function. The study showed the ""real-life"" viewing of someone watching a fictional educational program affected the same brain activity as watching a real educational program. The researchers hope future research could show how similar programming might impact children's behavior in school. ""Just like a movie, TV is a very basic media, and it is not a"

437,"Mixing less than 6 hours of sleep with chronic disease is deadly combo, study shows Rating means people with chronic disease have a greater risk for death than those without it -- ScienceDaily A study published in the October issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), recommends a simple, low-cost and relatively inexpensive clinical intervention to treat chronic chronic diseases. The study, which involved over 3600 patients in the United States, Canada and Europe, found that patients with chronic disease had a higher risk of death than people whose chronic disease was not treated with medications. ""We have a lot of work to do to improve outcomes in chronic disease patients,"" said senior author Dr. Thomas R. Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health. He added that the current drug regimen is not effective in treating chronic diseases. The researchers analyzed the outcomes of 34,663 patients who developed chronic disease. As a control group, patients with chronic disease had a greater risk of death than those without chronic disease. The authors note that their findings are based on a relatively small group of patients who may be more likely than their peers to develop chronic diseases -- and to die. ""It is important to understand the clinical significance of chronic disease,"" Insel said. This is a group that is really relatively healthy. But we don't have a good understanding of its biology. He said researchers cannot yet tell whether chronic disease is the disease causing the patient's death or if it is the cause of death. Insel said the study is a reminder that ""at some point, we have to find a system that can effectively treat chronic disease, and it is not easy."" The authors caution that the study only looked at the use of a drug that regulates the activity of the cell in the body. As for the potential risks of chronic disease, they recommend patients in the study see their primary care physicians if they experience a symptom that they think is mild or if an adverse reaction is the result of a genetic predisposition. They recommend the use of multiple medications in treating chronic diseases and to make sure that patients are diagnosed early who can be treated. The JAMA has more on chronic diseases.

The findings, from the United Nations ""Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, found that people would need to eat more than 200 to be safe to be as healthy as the average person - and that the amount of calories eaten by those in the top 10 per cent of food consumers was nearly twice as much as the average person's average. The study, led by the World Health Organization, said that if healthy people were eating around 200 calories a day, they would need to eat more than 200 fewer calories a day. Although the main cause of poor health is not being malnutritioned, the study said that poor diet, exposure to high fat, drinking too much, and smoking were key risk factors. The study also cited the insufficient storage of essential vitamins, particularly vitamin D, which it said"" is not available in many places around the world. ""This leaves us exposed to much more added intakes than we would need in order to maintain a healthy diet. A typical British person can expect to eat between 200 and 2100 calories a day, the study said, with the UK consuming 2100. The bottom 10 per cent of weight-users were found to have around 340-450g of added sugar a day, the study said. The WHO estimates that between 25 and 40 per cent of the UK population - around 6.3 million people - are currently overweight or obese. The UK has long been the target of a campaign to improve its health, with the government set to launch new obesity strategies in March.

443,"Surprising factors that may keep you thin are your age, family history, smoking, alcohol and physical inactivity. But most experts agree that it's best to remain slim. And the good news? For those in the dark, the disease is still more common than it used to be. For starters, the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that people at least get regular eye exams, and that adults get regular eye checks. In fact, eye exams go back to the 1940s and 1950s, and they're scheduled to start rolling out in mid-2015 and continue to decline until the end of 2016, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. ""It means a lot less of the vision loss we're seeing now,"" says Dr. John Dahlquist, chief of ophthalmology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. So as dark days approach, keep your eye healthy, and eat lots of fruits and vegetables. That way, it doesn't look like you're burying the good work you did. You'll still be at a higher risk for cataracts, and that's even if you're using a lens from one of those products. To Dr. Elizabeth Nash, a New York City ointment doctor, keeping your eyes healthy doesn't mean you should stop going out. Cataract surgery, for instance, can be a game-changer for keeping your vision in better shape. ""I used to have cataracts every year, and now I've become concerned with the risk of cataracts on my eyes,"" said Nash. Now I think cataracts are more common. Eye examinations are not always effective. ""They're not pretty,"" she added. Eye injury is a common eye injury and it's a very serious situation. After her op, Dahlquist added, she's hoping to see her friends again, and might even see them again. ""That would be good,"" she said. I hope I can get back to a normal life. It's a very important thing to do. Source: Dahlquist Y, Mathur E, et al. Cataract and Other Impact of Cataract on Age, Health, and Disease Risk in Women: A Randomized Trial. Ophthalmology.

444,"'Best diets' ranking puts keto last, DASH first-time dieting enthusiasts are more than happy to report that this year's top diets are more healthful, nutritionally balanced and fit than previous years, according to a new survey. In order to rank the top diets, researchers at the University of Bristol (UWE) surveyed more than 5,000 dieters and found that the top 50 diets were all more nutritionally balanced than the bottom five. The study was conducted in four regions of the United Kingdom, measuring how nutrients are distributed, how people eat. The study found that the top diets were all more nutritionally balanced than the bottom five, with higher quality foods, healthier diets and less carbohydrate, or fat, people consumed. The top diets for the ninth most expensive diets were: a ""cheat day"" diet rich in refined carbohydrates, processed meat foods, and processed red meat, particularly sweets that are high in sugar, salt and fats. People who follow a gluten-free diet would be best placed to find the results of the study and to help their families make healthy choices. ""The quality of food, whether it's fresh fish, chicken or pizzas, can vary hugely depending on the type of dietary plan you choose,"" said Dr Steve Wakefield, lead author of the study. I think this sort of 'diet-wise' approach is too simplistic, and people can't easily use this information to make the right choices. We've done more research on this than just diet and nutrition. The study was conducted in collaboration with the University of Bristol, and looked at the diets of 2,000 people from the U.K., Germany, France, and Australia. It found that those who were the most health-conscious ate a total of five of the top diets, with one-third of the participants having high protein intakes. Other diets consumed in the top 10 diets were: a ""cheat day"" diet rich in refined carbohydrates, processed meat foods, and processed red meat, particularly sweets that are high in sugar, salt and fats. The research was published in the Journal of Nutrition Education and Behaviour. The study was conducted by the International Institute of Dietetics and Dietetics."
445,"Asking yourself 'What's the meaning of life?' may extend it beyond the realm of science and education. To that end, the researchers developed a method that can be used to examine how physics affects our health. ""It's really important to understand how physics interacts with our environment,"" said Dr. Geraldine Eaton, a professor of physics, biological and environmental sciences, who is also an assistant professor of physics at UC San Diego. Understanding how physics interacts with our environment will improve our health and improve our productivity and efficiency. In addition to making people healthier and happier, the team is also trying to encourage people to eat healthier. It's also important to remember that simple changes, like eating less meat, can help you live longer. When we sit down to eat, we think of our bodies as being in a place where we still have the energy to act on our own. But it's important to take steps to ensure that we're in the perfect place to move forward. Source: Geraldine Eaton RG, et al.

"""" The case has emerged as a powerful symbol of women's rights in the United States, as political organizations such as Women's March hold rallies to demand that the president intervene. ""This is a powerful example of how the law could be changed to empower women and give them a voice,"" said Jennifer Jacobs, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Tufts University who helped lead the Women's March in Washington. And it's also about the power of the female vote. The case has also rattled universities across the country, who are grappling with rising costs and pressure to hire more women. Last week, a major college in Georgia, where women comprise less than 10 percent of faculty, announced that it would no longer accept transgender students. University President Ronald Cabrera said the decision was a reflection of what he called an ""increasingly polarized situation."" While he did not immediately say how he intended to address the issue, Cabrera said he was confident the school would be able to adequately address the women's needs. At the same time, university president John E. DeMuth said in a statement that the decision was purely business related. ""This decision is neither about students, nor is it about gender,"" DeMuth said. It is about the fact that our faculty will continue to serve as a model for how the world will function. At a press conference on Saturday, DeMuth was asked if he thought the decision was a setback for women's rights in Georgia. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear a case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union last week that sought to overturn the state's ban on same-sex marriage.

447,"Live Longer: Could you improve your lifespan? Researchers at the University of California have discovered that longer lifespans may improve your physical health. Researchers gave 56 women, aged between 30 and 72, five minutes of ""invigorating"" exercise in a laboratory. One was given a dumbbell and then pressed against a wall for 20 minutes. The three others were given the same dumbbells and a dumbbell and then sat still. The research found that activity improved after one hour of vigorous exercise, while the physical effects of exercise were the same. Dr John Murray, professor of human development and organisational health at the University of California, Irvine, said: ""The results show that exercising for a longer period is a better way to improve your life than simply standing before a computer screen."" However, he cautioned that people ""should not assume that the benefits of physical activity outweigh the costs of lifestyle."" The scientists studied 144 female participants who had been unable to break a sweat for more than two hours. The participants completed the 20-minute mock exercise test, which involved walking for 50 metres in a 10-metre time limit, with an average length of 21.5 metres. Some were told they would be fit to succeed for one month, while others were told they would get just 12 weeks to recover. After 12 weeks, the participants were tested for their blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides and insulin levels. Those who performed the exercise for less than five minutes each week would have a significantly lower percentage of cardiovascular risk factors, including being overweight or obese, than those who did not. The results showed that the more vigorous exercise, the more likely someone to achieve good health, while even one hour a day of vigorous exercise would have a similar effect. The research was published in the Annals of Neurology. Dr Murray said: ""We know that working out for 40 minutes every week can improve your cardiovascular fitness and your lifespan.

The 15-year-old has been described as ""our bright star,"" and his funeral will be held in Glasgow on Friday. He was taken to the city's Southern General Hospital on Wednesday and pronounced dead a few hours later. The other teenage pupils being treated for the virus have been released from hospital after being released from the hospital on Wednesday morning. A Police Scotland spokeswoman described those who had been admitted as ""well as those admitted to hospital earlier."" She added: ""Inquiries are ongoing to establish the cause of death and to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident."" The Health Protection Agency (HPA) said anyone with a cold or flu is at risk of falling ill. A spokesman said: ""Tragically, the death of a teenager, and the associated strain of flu, is a cause for concern. Anyone found to have flu-like symptoms should remain at home and contact NHS 24 on 08454 54 58. However, some people will experience mild illness. Anyone who has been in close contact with a person with flu-like symptoms and who is showing flu-like symptoms following contact with the virus should contact their GP. Dr Clare Gerada, director of public health for NHS Lothian, said:"" We can confirm that the death of a teenage male has been reported to the HPA. It is currently working with all relevant agencies to establish the facts, and to assist them with their inquiries. NHS Lothian agrees with any concerns raised regarding the health of any visitors to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The children who have been admitted now with flu-like symptoms are being treated as a priority. NHS Lothian is working closely with the family to provide support for them. A spokesman for the Royal Hospital for Sick Children said: ""We can confirm that a teenage student has died in the intensive care unit at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow. He has been transferred to intensive care. The Health Protection Agency [HPA] has closed the busiest section of hospital to all visitors and confirmed that the hospital will be closed until further notice. Anyone concerned about a child, or their relative, should contact their GP, and see their GP. In light of the news that the emergency department has been reopened to all patients, it is inappropriate for us to comment further."
449,"Flu shot: There's a mismatch this season -- and it's not good news for children A new government report suggests that even if a flu shot is taken every day in the United States, it's not enough to prevent the flu. The 2014 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found that only 31 percent of pregnant women and 26 percent of newborns get vaccinated against influenza, according to the CDC. The study used data from 1997-2011 and shows that, based on the CDC's own estimates, more than 1 in 2 pregnant women and about a third of newborns will get vaccinated. In the United States, vaccination rates are even lower. But so far, the flu vaccine has been safe in adults and children. The CDC does not have an estimate on why the vaccination rate has been lower. However, the newly released study looked at all pregnant women and children up to age 5 for a year. It found that vaccination levels were similar in younger children. In the top 10 countries for vaccination, vaccination rates ranged from 82 percent in developing countries in Africa to 76.3 percent in the Netherlands. The lowest-ranked countries are India (54.2 percent) and Pakistan (47.6 percent). Flu shots are recommended for everyone over 6 years old. They can help protect against flu if children are not fully immunized. The CDC recommends that pregnant women and children 10 years and older get the vaccine every year. And for older children, the flu shot is advised to have two doses of Fluzone / Fluzone / Fluzone. It can also give children a second shot of a different flu strain to protect them from developing acute respiratory illnesses. ""These findings show that vaccination to everyone over 6 years old has been sufficient to reduce the mortality of the flu in the United States,"" Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the CDC's Influenza Division, said in a statement. The CDC is urging people to get flu shots at a doctor's office to reduce the risk of spreading the flu. ""If people have other health issues and their doctor asks them to get a flu shot, they should get the vaccine,"" Murray said. As of now we do not recommend vaccination to those under 6 years old.

451,"Do I need a flu shot? I am 64 years old and have been vaccinated against flu for the past 18 months. I have been very active in my community, particularly at school and in local groups and football clubs. I am worried about the flu vaccine and am not sure whether the shots would help. Is there a way to prevent the spread of the virus and prevent it spreading? The vaccine is a useful and simple jab. As well as being safe and effective in the short term, it has many other advantages, such as reducing the chances of the virus developing into a serious illness in the first place. It can also prevent serious complications such as pneumonia or sepsis. The jab also has the potential to be used in people who are at increased risk of developing serious illnesses from other diseases, such as asthma and heart disease. If you do not have the flu vaccination, you should seek medical advice from your GP. Over the past 50 years there have been more than 1,200 confirmed flu cases in the UK. The most serious cases were in 2009 where H3N2 - a strain of influenza that is known to have an impact on the immune system - became apparent. In 2012 the H3N2 strain was found to be circulating in the UK, but it was not thought to be responsible for the death of two people. In 2015 there have been more than 1,200 confirmed flu cases in the UK, a similar figure to the number reported for the previous year. The H3N2 strain - which is more commonly found in young children - is not included in the vaccination programme. However, it does not appear to pose a significant health risk to people under 15 years, who are currently protected by the existing jabs.

452,"Most states make it difficult for children to get a flu shot. ""The flu shot is a very effective tool for prevention,"" Olle said. It's a very effective tool to protect against the influenza virus and that's why it's important that you get it. In most states, you're going to have to get the vaccine before you're allowed to go to the doctor. That's why it's so important for you to get vaccinated when you're going to be sick and you haven't seen a doctor in a while. In the end, the vaccine can protect you from these influenza viruses for a couple of weeks. Olle said that it's also important that it's not too late for people who are unsure if they should get a flu shot. If you or your family have already gotten the flu shot, that's another reason you should get it right away. You're protecting your friends, your family and your pets, ""Olle said. Every year, about 2.7 million kids get the flu -- the majority of those over the age of 3. Here are the numbers: About 4 million children get the flu each year -- and it's often mild, such as flu-like symptoms. About 8.7 percent of children diagnosed with the flu die. About 11.6 percent of those diagnosed with the flu die. About 17 percent of those diagnosed with the flu stay in the hospital for more than a week. The flu usually strikes the elderly, young people, people with chronic diseases and healthy people. It's common in older adults but can be difficult to diagnose. It is especially dangerous in children. The CDC estimates it's about 70 percent of the time the flu jab doesn't work, and many people get the flu in the colds or flu symptoms, or in the throat, that isn't treatable. In order to protect yourself, get the flu shot and get it right away. If you haven't gotten the flu shot yet, Olle suggests getting it as soon as you can. If you get it faster, it's a lot easier to get it. Most people get the flu shot in about 20 minutes. That's about how long it takes to get the flu shot. The CDC says the best time to get the flu shot is between 21 to 36 hours after your initial shot. People aren't really getting the shot until they're at least 58. People need to stay home for a week or two after getting the flu shot."

454,"Sleep anxiety and daylight saving time can exacerbate insomnia, but stretching may help because it lowers the pain threshold in the brain that causes it. ""Sleep is not only a physical and mental problem,"" said Dr. Steven Levitch, director of the Sleep Disorders Center at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. The physical and mental stress of sleep deprivation has many health benefits, including a reduced risk of obesity and a better quality of life. It also reduces the need to take medications, such as aspirin, that can be associated with sleep-disrupted episodes such as insomnia. The number of Americans who suffer from insomnia tends to be higher in the evening, but the night-time sleeping disorders do not seem to be associated with greater psychological distress. Sleep is the focus of many studies, but there is little research on the consequences of sleep deprivation on the performance of the brain. Sleeping disorders affect about 10 percent of the population, and people who suffer from sleep disorders have a higher chance of developing problems such as anxiety, depression and substance abuse, according to the Alzheimer's Association. An estimated 4.2 million Americans suffer from sleep disorders, and more than 7 million suffer from a sleep disorder, the group said. Source: Levitch M. Sleep loss. Sleep and Sleep Disorders.

456,"'Prolonged, unprotected contact 'led to first person-to-person coronavirus transmission in the US, study says A man who had contact with a man infected with the first person-to-person coronavirus (NCDV) in the US has died, the US health department said today. The man, who was 33 and from New York, became the first person to contract the virus from healthcare workers or other healthcare workers who came into direct contact with him, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. CDC scientists are analyzing how the patient contracted the virus, the CDC said. The patient was admitted to a hospital in Manhattan on Friday with a fever and a cough. He died on Sunday. The first case of the virus, which spreads through contact with blood, was contracted in a US healthcare worker who had direct contact with an infected healthcare worker, according to the CDC. The case has been sent to public health laboratories, and the disease is expected to be confirmed in humans, the CDC said. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention today identified the first person-to-person case of the virus in the US as a man who had contact with a dead person last week. CDC epidemiologist David Acheson said testing the blood of the dead patient to determine their exact spread will be useful in determining the origins of the virus, but that it will take several weeks to determine what the virus is. The CDC said it was not immediately clear how the patient contracted the disease. The news will be troubling for people who are already vulnerable to the virus. ""This does not necessarily mean that anyone who is at risk of contracting a virus from a healthcare worker is at greater risk for getting one,"" said Dr Acheson. But for the people who are at greatest risk for contracting a virus from a healthcare worker, this is a potentially very serious illness. This report contains material from Reuters.

457,"Is it allergies, the flu or the coronavirus? How to tell the difference If you bought the allergy shots, you'll be taking them for five to seven days, says Dr. Benjamin Williams, director of a pediatric allergy clinic at the University of Michigan. So, try to limit your exposure to raw foods and pollen. If you could, you could also take antiviral medications like Tamiflu and Relenza, which are prescription-only. Consider what you're eating and how the drug may affect your allergic response -- your reaction time, your blood pressure and your immune system. That's when it's best to be sure you're using Tamiflu and Relenza. If you're in a class of people, it's best to use antivirals. And don't forget to wash your hands, but do not contaminate indoor surfaces. What to do if you have a food allergy? Here are some tips to keep in mind: Always wash hands, not under the table. Use a tissue to dry out the lining of your mouth. Avoid touching your throat with a wet cloth, like a tissue that you may try to attach to your pillow. Always cover your mouth when you're coughing, and always avoid making eye contact with your eyes. Avoid touching your mouth as your mouth drops and your eyes become watery. It's best to avoid talking with your eyes or mouth area for a minute. Make eye contact with your palm to relieve tension. Avoid touching your mouth when you're coughing or sneezing. If you're going to be sick, be sure to wear sunglasses. Keep your hands away from your eyes. If you're sick, make an appointment with your pharmacist.

Measles is highly infectious, and is contracted through coughing and sneezing by a person who has not been immunized, the Associated Press reported. On Sunday night, Chris Gattelli, who plays the lead role in the play, was hospitalized with severe respiratory issues, the AP said. And last week, the show's star, Michael Rooker, was hospitalized with pneumonia, ABC News reported. Measles has been a public health crisis in the United States, with the last confirmed case reported last year in California. The illnesses were caused by the MMR vaccine, also known as ""MMR."" These diseases are not, however, contagious, and are not life-threatening. According to a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the MMR-16 vaccine is the most effective way to prevent measles in the United States.

460,"Babies smell 'sweet,' teens stink and blindfolded moms can tell the difference, study says SOUTH KOREA, Ind. -- There may be some truth to the fact that babies are often exposed to different smells when they're around. Some research suggests they may have more trouble understanding what smells they're inhaling, and that this problem might be even worse if it were to be recognized as an adult. Researchers at Indiana University interviewed mothers, parents and other adults who had never smoked and who were likely exposed to seven different odors -- some of which were not unpleasant. The researchers found that babies were more likely to smell than adults when they were around 8 months old. ""For some people, smell is a source of anxiety and fear,"" said Angie Dixon, a graduate student in the Department of Psychology. The study was published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin. It's something we take for granted. We're taking for granted that these senses are good for you. It's not, ""Dixon said. The researchers also found that the more smells babies were exposed to, the more the mothers' children would stare at the smell."" We found that children who were exposed to more smells were less likely to stare at the smells and their children were more likely to stare at the smells, ""Dixon said. The researchers also found that the babies tended to smell less when they were closer to the smell or with their mothers."" This shows that your body can't change the fact that you smell, ""Dixon said. The study authors also found that the older a mother was, the more distressing the smells she or she experienced.

""The US Department of Agriculture has been notified of an outbreak of the SARS-like virus in three states,"" the league said in a statement. The three states are Arizona, Colorado and Washington. The first of the three states, Colorado, and Washington, is suspected to be the source of the outbreak, which has sickened 1,700 people around the world. ""This is a difficult time for all involved in the NBA,"" the league said. We are working with the appropriate health authorities and the private sector to identify the source of the outbreak and to prevent any further spread of the virus. The Dallas Mavericks announced on Monday they would play two home games in the National Basketball Association's February 18-19 regular season in the Dallas area. The league also said a number of schools, including the University of Texas at Dallas, have made plans to start playing their home games on Tuesday, February 18. The announcement came amid a series of health scares that have swept the country. In the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, a gunman opened fire on a crowded music festival full of concertgoers, killing at least eight people and injuring 68 others. Wednesday's series between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Portland Trail Blazers in Portland, Ore., was postponed due to the situation. The other two teams, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Denver Nuggets, were also forced to cancel Sunday's game. The league said it had already informed the teams of the situation and would convene a meeting of its emergency management committee. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the virus, which is a new virus that causes a distinctive rash, is spreading rapidly through the Americas, Asia and Europe. It has now spread to 21 countries and territories and killed at least 36 people in Mexico. The WHO's chief flu official, Keiji Fukuda said last week that the virus had killed more than 1,200 people around the world. The WHO last month predicted that the death toll could surge to 5,000 by the end of February."

464,"Lessons from Ebola: The secret of successful epidemic response In 2003, Michael Oppenheimer became the first American to be diagnosed with Ebola in the US. He was flown to a secure hospital in Nebraska before returning to the US. He was diagnosed with Ebola from Liberia, where he worked at the charity Omalu. The virus was eventually eliminated from the African country. Twenty-two years on he has been speaking to the BBC about the work of the Global Fund to Fight Aids. He spoke to the BBC about the dangers of the spread of the disease and the lessons to be learned from the US. With the Ebola crisis, it was inevitable that we would lose some people in the process. How do you identify when someone is arriving at a hospital? It is not just a question of what is they going to do, it is just the fact that there is a risk in that someone can pass the disease on. What is the worst case scenario and how should they be treated? What are the chances of a successful outbreak? When we have a patient with Ebola we know that they are going to be isolated, but when the patient dies, the virus becomes very difficult to contain. Image caption Michael Oppenheimer (right) was working as a doctor in Liberia before he contracted the disease He said that if you do not have an isolation unit, you can go back into your own home, some place you are not well, but that does not mean you will stay there. For example, in the US, there is a very big window of opportunity to have a full or partial quarantine. If a person is really ill, it looks like they are dying, and they may have to be isolated for between 24 to 48 hours. They can be isolated for longer, and they can be isolated for up to 48 hours. That can be extremely dangerous for a patient. But I think the most important thing is that we encourage people to report these things. I can tell you that people who have been in contact with Ebola are doing so in a really positive way. But that does not mean that they are going to die. They are still in isolation. This is the only way to stay healthy and be well. In other words, people's health is just as important as their chances of survival.

465,"'They didn't protect us' say some first responders for coronavirus outbreak in UK Since the outbreak, the only ward in the UK to receive the disease - the unit that treated the victims - has closed while it is being investigated. A local prefect said: ""I am relieved the three other patients were not affected by the outbreak. I would have liked to have been able to do that better but we will see what happens. The first confirmed case of the disease this winter was in the Royal Free Hospital in north London, where two patients died. The other two cases were in the hospital's intensive care unit. An investigation by Public Health England found that an unusually high number of cases had been reported in Scotland, in contrast to other parts of the UK where patients had been affected first. Two others were found in the hospital's laboratory, including a woman who had recently returned from Spain and a man who had been admitted to hospital. Dr John Watson, the director of the National Infection Service in Scotland, said:"" I am reassured that we have identified a low risk to others who have been in close contact with the infected patient. However, we are aware that there is a risk to further cases of this disease. We urge the public to be vigilant and report any suspected cases they may have. The virus has now spread to other parts of Europe, including Germany, where a further 12 people are known to have suffered respiratory illnesses in the past two months. The total number of cases in Europe so far this year to date stands at 122, according to the latest data from Eurostat. Of course, the figures do not necessarily reflect cases in the UK as individual cases are often known to be in Spain and the rest of Europe. Dr Watson said that the British Association of Shock Surgeons, which represents the UK's general foot and ankle surgeons, ""strongly advises"" those with foot and ankle injuries to seek advice. He added that anyone who has fallen ill from foot or ankle sprains is advised not to return to work. The infection can lead to an infection of the joints, muscles and ligaments of the feet and tendons of the fingers, and is an incurable condition. It can travel to the heart, blood vessels, brain, spine or other organs. Hospitals are being urged to provide antibiotics to prevent the spread of the infection."
466,"How to keep your workplace clean -- and yourself healthy -- during the novel coronavirus outbreak (CNN) -- Working in the healthcare industry is not always a pleasant experience. As we head to the New Year, many workers feel stressed and anxious. Even in the worst of times, it can be a bit of a shock. For example, your boss may be having a difficult time coping with the outbreak of norovirus. How can you keep your workplace clean? The best thing you can do is help your co-workers who feel the effects of the illness and how to prevent them from feeling unwell. A simple step for the majority of people is to stay away from ill workers. This is because it can make their work worse, especially if they are dealing with sick people. If you have a physical sick co-worker and you can't get to him because the sick worker can't be around, your co-worker could become worse. If you are sick, you can stop working or call your manager. This can prevent your work environment from becoming a place where you can't do your job, ""says Dr. Joseph Soseka, associate professor of human resource management at the University of Minnesota Medical School. If you are sick, you can call the office and ask on the phone. This can prevent your colleague from working or going to work,"" he says. If you are sick and you have any signs of illness, you should contact your co-worker to ensure that you are not working from a safe source, health care professionals say. It's fine if you have a sick co-worker and you can't go to work, but if you are sick and you can't get to him because the sick employee can't be around, you should contact your co-worker. The best thing to do is stay home and get support, ""explains Soseka. Keep your co-workers posted on social media, and share the information with your co-workers, Soseka suggests. For more information, contact your co-workers directly by phone at 1-800-SIST-NO. The best thing to do is contact your co-workers directly, says Soseka. You can also call your boss directly, or text your boss directly."" When you call an operator, you should write a lengthy email and let them know you are there and that your co-workers are also there, ""Soseka says."
467,"Why CNN is calling the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic The 2009 outbreak of the flu virus was named after the 15th century French writer and pastor Michel Philippe Rousseau. It was the worst outbreak of the virus in a century. In the 1918 pandemic, the World Health Organization declared, ""The outbreak of the pandemic was labeled a pandemic of the severity of its severity, and was formally declared a pandemic of the severity and spread of the disease."" In the context of the current outbreak, CNN's coverage of it looks like a very small strain of one of those viruses, a particularly deadly strain of influenza, which has been devastating in the United States. As CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta and John Bonifield explain, the World Health Organization says the virus is spreading quickly and is currently found in laboratories in 39 countries across the globe, but the number of confirmed cases is likely to be higher. In addition, the virus's widespread spread has resulted in hundreds of deaths worldwide. The origin of the illness is unknown, but the strain is distinct from the one which has killed hundreds of people in Hong Kong, where the virus is most common. ""This virus has gained an incredible amount of interest and has gained a tremendous amount of attention around the world,"" Gupta said. So, how did the world get to this point? The answer is simple, Gupta said. The pandemic's pandemic got a lot more attention than a lot of other diseases, and it seems to have played a major role in influencing the outbreak of the flu in the United States. But in order to combat this new virus, much more work was needed to figure out how to prevent the spread of its infection, and how to stop it from reaching the United States.

The United Nations estimates more than 130,000 people have been killed in the eight-year war that began as peaceful protests against President Bashar Assad's regime. In recent weeks, the regime has also unleashed a fierce crackdown on protesters, including arrests and torture. U.N. officials say more than 10,000 people have been killed since mid-March, and reports of abuses by the security forces have grown. There has been no independent confirmation of the death tolls. The latest U.N. figures show at least 2,600 people have been killed since mid-March. The opposition says more than 4,000 people have been killed since mid-March. The Syrian government denies the charges, blaming the violence on armed terrorist gangs and foreign-backed defectors. The U.N. estimates some 5,000 people have died since mid-March, while rights groups put the number at much higher than 3,000. The U.N.

The pits, located in the northwest city of Isfahan, are known for their long-range explosions that have caused maximum death and destruction to victims. The shells were discovered just days after the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS / ISIL) terrorists began dismantling their urban bases in Syria and Iraq. The mass grave is believed to be in the same area where a suicide bomber killed at least 80 people in November 2015. In the photos, the mass grave is marked by a large, wooden cross. Activists have compared the burial pits to ancient grave sites, where the bodies were dug up and then thrown into the sea. The bodies of some of those killed in the Paris attacks have been identified. Iran has been conducting airstrikes against IS fighters in Syria, with the first airstrikes in late August. The IS (IS, formerly ISIS / ISIL) jihadists captured large swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014, and later imposed a harsh version of Islamic Shariah law. In Syria, the group now controls large parts of territory spanning more than 27,000 square kilometers.

Dr Hamid Jahromi, who heads Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation, said the government was facing a ""huge strain"" of the virus which affected more than 5,000 people in the past two months. ""I have some patients who have died with respiratory problems and others who have died of complications such as pneumonia,"" he said last night. The virus is more lethal than the Ebola virus but has caused huge delays in the delivery of treatment for patients in hospitals and clinics. Dr Jahromi said: ""All the hospitals and clinics are short of water, we are counting on our hospitals, clinics and people to be able to get medical treatment for all the affected people."" In the past week, more than 60 people in Iran have died from Ebola while almost 100 cases have been reported in the country. About 4,500 people have died of the virus.

471,"Iran to temporarily free 54,000 prisoners as coronavirus spreads TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - Iran's deputy health minister says the government has ordered all 54,000 prisoners to be freed from a Tehran prison as a coronavirus outbreak takes hold. The decision comes days after the death of an Iranian man in custody, bringing the total number of cases of the virus to 14. Deputy Health Minister Mohammed Sattari says Tuesday that the ministry will monitor the situation. The death of the man who was hospitalized in mid-October has also raised fears about the sanitation of inmates. Coronaviruses are a deadly respiratory illness that can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and fever. The virus, which tends to be spread by direct contact with infected people, is highly contagious and can be spread by touching objects contaminated by the feces of sick or dead. In most cases, it spreads to those who have been in close contact with the contaminated, contaminated objects and in the case of a severe illness. At least 128 people have died, according to the Iranian Health Ministry, with the overall death toll from it being at least 5,500. Contrary to official reports, the illness is not fatal. Iran has the world's highest rate of deaths from the virus: about 3,000 a year, according to the World Health Organization. The virus was discovered in a man who came into contact with an inmate who was hospitalized in July. The man recovered, but the virus was spread to other prisoners. According to Iranian news media, the man who died had been arrested for smuggling in rockets and was being held in prison without access to medicine or proper medicine. The health ministry says the infection spreads to other inmates, but that it has not been confirmed that the person who died was infected by the virus. The virus is often transmitted by direct contact, with contact with an infected person. It is not spread by direct contact if the person is contaminated by the virus. The virus can be treated with antibiotics. It can also be acquired by contact with contaminated objects. The virus is treatable with various vaccines, but experts say that is unlikely to completely eliminate the virus. The World Health Organization has set a goal of eradicating the virus by 2015. Iran's Ministry of Health said last week that the ministry had begun reducing the number of cases, citing better surveillance and testing"

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) also said Iran had ""clarified"" its nuclear activities, saying it would respond to any additional inspections. ""Iran has submitted a clarification to the IAEA's nuclear agency on its nuclear activities,"" a statement from the Vienna-based body said. ""Iran will respond when the IAEA conducts new inspections,"" it added. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the United States, Israel, the European Union and other nations fear it has a secret weapons program aimed at developing weapons. The United States has repeatedly pressed Tehran to stop producing nuclear arms, saying that it would not have a negotiating position if other nations stopped the program. On Thursday, Tehran announced it would reduce the core of its uranium enrichment capacity to 3.5 percent, saying it would reduce this further to between 0.5 percent and 2 percent to boost enrichment. The current U.N. Security Council resolution is aimed at enforcing a six-month interim agreement to curb Iran's nuclear program, which U.S. officials believe is intended to produce a nuclear bomb. Iran denies Western allegations that it is seeking to develop nuclear arms, insisting it wants to produce electricity for a growing population. The IAEA said on Thursday it had obtained information that Iran planned to have two uranium enrichment plants and possibly more by 2015. The information, provided to the agency by the agency, is of ""high sensitivity,"" the agency said. According to the agency, Iran had already started to convert its stockpile of high-grade uranium into its fuel rods. The IAEA also said it had received information that Iranian scientists were manufacturing nuclear fuel rods, uranium isotopes and an active centrifuge, a key component of nuclear weapons. The agency said it is in talks with Iran on possible applications for Iran to become a member of its Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

He added that Washington would now ""reassess"" its stance on Jerusalem. ""We have said that we will make sure that it's not impossible to reach a final agreement, but that it's very important to take it seriously,"" Mr Muntazer said. As we have said, Washington is committed to taking this into account when planning and considering the future of the treaty. Mr Muntazer was speaking just hours after Jordan's King Abdullah II, the heir to the throne, made an unprecedented visit to Washington in September. He is due to hold talks with President Donald Trump in the White House on Tuesday. Mr Trump is expected to announce backing for a Palestinian state in the coming days. The US president has already said he would be looking to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and withdraw US funding for the UN agency providing aid for Palestinian refugees. The Israeli government has already announced that it will be withdrawing the next $800m (£52bn) in aid money that the US provides to the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and UN agency UNRWA. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said ""all the possible solutions"" to the conflict in the Middle East would be discussed with Mr Trump during his visit to Washington on Tuesday. ""We have received a very positive response but this must not be a substitute for the ongoing negotiations, especially our efforts to bring an end to what is happening in the world,"" Mr Abbas said. We will continue our efforts to establish a Palestinian state and end what is happening in the world and we are ready to continue these efforts until such time as there is an agreement. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he will not move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Israel's decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem is likely to further strain already frayed relations between the two countries. Israel regards Jerusalem as its eternal and indivisible capital. It has also threatened to cut off its electricity supply to the Palestinian territories if the US does not return to the negotiating table. Israel's cabinet has approved Mr Trump's renewed ""America First"" policies towards Israel, which include plans to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The US Embassy in Israel will remain open."
474,"Israel's Netanyahu on course to win most seats, but may be short of majority JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel's prime minister is on course to win most parliamentary seats and may be short of a certain majority, but could still lose his two-thirds majority if left to his own devices. Benjamin Netanyahu's task is to form a coalition after Jan. 22 elections, and this is expected to take longer. A series of votes could come before the election, but Netanyahu's victory could undermine his negotiating position with the Palestinians. Israel's elections are held in June, and the rightist Likud party is expected to win. But the outcome could also alter the balance of power in Israeli politics, threatening the coalition's survival if it falls short of the two-thirds majority required for a government. Netanyahu, who was elected prime minister in 2009, inherited a tough coalition with the centrist Kadima party, which is expected to form a coalition government and support the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. Netanyahu's coalition partner, the Socialists, is also expected to form a new government and could be closer that of Netanyahu's party and the Likud. Netanyahu's closest rival in the election, Binyamin Netanyahu, is on course to win the election, but he could easily lose the majority if left to his own devices. The latest polls show a tight race, with Kadima projected to win around 25 seats, while Likud could win around 14. The biggest party, Labor, is expected to get around 15 seats. It has ruled out joining the coalition, but it may try to form a minority government. Labor leader Isaac Herzog and other hard-line Likud members are trying to form a government, and Herzog is likely to come out ahead. The most likely coalition partner would be the right-wing Jewish Home, which is expected to win around 14 seats, or Tzipi Livni of the centrist Kadima party, a far cry from last year's election. The current two-party system allows a narrow majority for the largest parties. However, the left-wing and religious parties are expected to win more seats than the centrist Yisrael Beitenu. Associated Press writers Dalia Nammari and Tarek el-Tablawy contributed to this report. This version CORRECTS that Netanyahu won most parliamentary seats, not the two seats. This story corrects the spelling of Netanyahu's name to Tzipi"
475,"Netanyahu projected to win Israeli election, but exit polls suggest bloc just short of majority 23 (UPI) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, elected in March, is projected to win a fourth term in office, but will likely be short of a majority. Polls suggest a narrow majority of Israelis favor a new prime minister in the November election. If one of those results comes in, Netanyahu would become Israel's longest-serving prime minister, surpassing Benjamin Netanyahu, who served from 1993 to 1999, and the longest-serving prime minister since Yitzhak Rabin. A poll conducted by the Pew Research Center and Yediot Ahronot, published Sunday, showed a narrow majority of Israelis believe the country's economy is in dire straits and they're now voting for new leaders, Pew said. ""The results of our poll suggest that Israel's economy is in dire straits,"" said the poll, published Sunday in the Yediot Ahronot newspaper. Yisrael Beytenu, the head of the liberal Meretz party and a former defense minister, said the poll reflected voter demand for change. ""As an example, more people than ever before would vote for the coalition that has been created by Prime Minister Netanyahu,"" Beytenu said. In a separate survey by Israel Democracy Institute, 57 percent of Israelis believe the country is on the brink of a political breakdown, the largest margin in the country's recent history. A poll by the Israel Study Group, which surveyed 808 registered Israel voters, found 70 percent of those surveyed believe Netanyahu is trying to change the political map. Almost twice as many respondents said they believe Netanyahu tried to change the political map in the last year. The Pew Research Center surveyed 1,005 Israelis in November. The margin of error is 2 percentage points. The polling calls for new elections between September and March. Netanyahu's Likud party and the centrist Kadima party are expected to enter the next coalition, with an agreement expected to be announced in late November. The polling also shows a difference in popularity of the two major parties, which each have the ability to govern with the support of at least 17 Knesset seats. If the coalition falls short of a majority, Netanyahu will be forced to step down and Israel will be left with an interim prime minister, a caretaker government and possible new elections. One of Netanyahu's early policies would have seen the Palestinians ask to join the"

478,"Sophie Trudeau, wife of Canadian Prime Minister, tests positive for coronavirus Canadians will be asked to take a look at the results of an epidemiology trial that found another woman tested positive for a serious strain of the coronavirus. TORONTO, June 25 (UPI) -- The Canadian Prime Minister's new wife, Sophie Trudeau, was re-tested this week for the dangerous virus. The woman, who remains unidentified, was said to be in stable condition at a hospital in Ottawa. The results of the test on her husband's wife were expected Tuesday, but the Liberals said privacy laws prevented them from releasing it because of the privacy laws. The new cases were detected in New York City, where Trudeau and his wife, the Canadian Prime Minister, were staying during John F. Kennedy's funeral last week. The woman had no known previous contact with the Prime Minister, the BBC reported. The New York Health Department said they were testing the woman for the novel coronavirus, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. The virus is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of one infected person. ""There's no specific cause for the new cases, but this is an unusual situation,"" the statement said. The disease is similar to SARS, which was declared a global health emergency in 2003. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in March 2010 there were more than 300 confirmed cases of the virus. The virus is transmitted through contact with an infected person's bodily fluids. In the United States, there have been three cases. There has been no reported cases in Canada. ""The government is working closely with people and health organizations to evaluate the situation and determine if further action is needed,"" Health Minister Jane Philpott said in a statement. This is an unusual situation and it is important that health care professionals remain vigilant. New York City health officials said they were working with the city's medical community to determine if the woman was in contact with the couple. The woman was the third person to test positive for coronavirus in Canada. According to the latest data available, there are 10 cases in all and more than 100 people in Canada have been infected. The public should avoid close contact with a person who may have been exposed to the virus, ""the CDC said in a statement. People who are in close contact with the person should seek medical attention immediately."
479,"Brazilian president's press secretary tests positive for coronavirus, days after meeting Trump SAO PAULO - The press secretary for Brazil's president says the media boss who got sick while greeting President Donald Trump has tested positive for the deadly coronavirus, as the country faces a deadly flu epidemic. Rodrigo Levy said in a statement that the news media is ""scandalized by the failure of a single person to identify with the illness, in particular the first lady's health."" Coronavirus causes severe fever and is usually transmitted by direct contact with an infected person. The media boss is the first Brazilian president to be hospitalized in the outbreak since the outbreak began a week ago. Brazil's health minister, Ricardo Cardoso, said Wednesday that the first lady's doctor reported that she had been on a respirator for some time. Levy said that government staff conducted tests Thursday and found that the body of the first lady was not infected. Coronavirus is a viral disease that is spread through contact with the saliva of infected people. Samples will be taken from the body to determine if they have the virus. Levy said that the press secretary was being treated in the hospital while a team of doctors and nurses prepared him. He said that doctors will examine the president's body, who is undergoing tests. The World Health Organization said Wednesday there were 1,546 confirmed cases of the virus in 14 countries as of Wednesday. The virus is now spreading across South America. There are about 2,000 confirmed deaths in Brazil, with more than half of the cases occurring in the capital, Brasilia. The virus is typically transmitted by direct contact with an infected person, but cases in health care facilities have also been reported. The World Health Organization calls it a ""highly contagious and deadly"" virus and said it will ""most likely"" take hold in most countries within several months. The virus can be transmitted through direct contact with saliva, bodily fluids, secretions or excrement of close contact, such as sharing showers or sharing towels. Most cases are found in regions where large numbers of people are infected. Health authorities in several countries have said the virus is spreading quickly in many areas, including Brazil and Mexico. So far, it's killing more people than the virus does in the United States. Officials say it's caused by viruses from mosquitoes that feed on blood-sucking mos"
480,"Once the Amazon rainforest passes the point of no return it could be gone in decades. ""It is absolutely crucial that the government and the private sector work together to protect the rainforest and deliver a sustainable future for Australia and the rest of the world,"" he said. The group also called for the government to commit to the ""ambitious sustainable development goals"" (SOFA), stating: ""One of the world's most important forests, the Amazon rainforest is a globally important and unique ecosystem and the government should go out and re-think this policy with urgency."" The group also called on the government to put its proposed $18 billion in climate change funding into a fund to help solar energy developers build their projects. They also called on governments not to neglect the future of Australia's forests, saying there was a need for governments to develop ""ecologically sound"" technologies such as solar, wind and biomass. ""Recommendations should be made to support our forests, to reduce deforestation and to increase our ability to sustain our abundant wildlife,"" said a spokesman for the group. The government's package of measures is being referred to the Productivity Commission, which has been asked to ensure it does not break up the industry. The government is expected to make a decision on its future forestry spending in June. NSW has the only government-owned land in the country and wants to set up a sustainable forestry fund as part of the national government's efforts to reduce the state's total land use by 80 per cent by 2030. South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory are among the states that are pushing for a more ambitious target ahead of the federal election. The federal government is due to release its position paper for the future of the forest in the next few months. It has set a June 30 deadline for bids for the fund, though it is not expected to be announced before then. The last time Australia set a target for deforestation was in 2007, when it spent $2.2 billion on tree planting. An Abbott government spokesman said on Wednesday that the government would release its position paper for the next five years. ""The government is considering a range of options, including the use of a carbon tax to fund the National Forest Plan, to ensure that Australia remains an attractive place to invest,"" he said. This government has always been clear that we will tackle climate change and the environment."
481,"Armed gang steals $15m in Chilean airport robbery Chilean police investigating a drug-smuggling gang's heist of $15m (£9.6m) at a Chilean airport said they had arrested six people and recovered the stolen money. The gang, including three Saudis and two Colombians, were heading to Buenos Aires to smuggle cocaine to the United States, according to the president of the airline, which organised the robbery. The gang planned to throw a plane full of cash over the runway at Santiago's Ezeiza airport on Monday, but left empty handed when staff in plastic safety masks jumped off the plane as it flew low over the runway. Gunfire also rang out as several members of the gang threw stones at the aircraft, while other members fled through a locked door. President Michelle Bachelet has come under criticism for her handling of the incident, and has been criticised for not speaking up earlier. The raid took place in a quiet, rural area of the country, and none of the airport's 11,000 passengers and staff were harmed. The gang is suspected of carrying out a robbery that happened in October 2004 in which they stole roughly $20m (£14.1m) from the airport. The gang is also accused of involvement in last year's attack on a Brazilian airliner, in which 10 people died. The money was taken with the help of international drug trafficking agents, the police said. The gang members include three Saudis and two Colombians. Two of the suspects are reported to be foreigners, while the third is a foreigner. One of the arrested suspects is a well-known drug trafficker, who is alleged to have served as a bodyguard for them. The others are alleged lieutenants. The two men are believed to have had links to the region's powerful drug cartels. The raids were carried out jointly by police, the Chilean Air Force and the security ministry and involve several other agencies, including the Federal Police, security and immigration service. The airport's operations manager, Hugo Pena, told reporters: ""During the heist the thieves stole the plane and the luggage. This is a very unusual area. Our security team are working with the police and customs authorities to find out what happened. It is too early to say if the criminals can be traced. The airport has been closed since the robbery and the investigation is ongoing. The airport's chief executive, Gustavo Sanchez, said he was"" saddened and"
482,"Mexico imagines a world without women, in strike against gender violence, which is behind many of the homicides recorded. ""We would like to take this moment to recognize the courage of many women, both in terms of their courage and their fight,"" she said. The Mexican government is also taking steps to improve women's safety and to combat the violence that is so prevalent in the north. The national police force has been restructured and some of its officers trained as psychologists. But many women say they are still subjected to attacks. In October, two women died and 41 were injured in a gang-related attack in the state of Michoacan, where the country has one of the highest homicide rates in the world. The Mexican government has said it will work to eliminate the violence and improve health care, education, housing and public safety. ""We will continue to fight the cartels,"" said María del Carmen Cruz, director of the Iberoamericana (International Women's Day) Foundation, referring to the powerful drug gang the Knights Templar. To help fight the organized crime, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto's administration is changing the country's paramilitary strategy to focus on the more lucrative business of kidnapping and extortion, which has long been a sore point among Mexico's youth. But a change in its approach has been slow to take hold. Last week, Mexico extradited Carlos Ebrard, a former lieutenant governor of Michoacan who was arrested in 2006. Ebrard was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the kidnapping and drug trafficking crimes of his captors, a term Pena Nieto has maintained was too lenient. Mexico had hoped that the extradition would allow him to be prosecuted in the United States, where he served as governor from 2000 to 2002. His transfer to the U.S. was delayed because of Mexican concern that he would be persecuted in Mexico for his role in the Knights Templar drug cartel. His release comes despite promises to take punitive measures to tackle the violence. In 2012, Pena Nieto signed an order forbidding Mexican citizens from going anywhere near an area where sex or drugs are common. Mexico's armed forces are required to report cases of sexual violence to the Mexican attorney general's office. The government has also promised to use new laws to fight sexual violence.

More than 50 others are missing in northeastern state of Amazonas. In the northwest state of Para, people are still waiting for their first showers. Forecasters expect the rain to end on Sunday, but the rains could continue to cause flooding and mudslides. Rainfall was expected to continue in metropolitan Manaus, Rio de Janeiro, Fortaleza, Recife and other parts of the state of Para this week. The flooding has prompted President Dilma Rousseff to travel to the affected area to survey the damage. The rains are part of a series of storms that began in the South American country on Saturday and are expected to continue through the weekend. A mudslide killed 17 people in northern Brazil and another three in Minas Gerais state. A man was killed in a mudslide in Manaus and at least nine people were reported missing in those regions. In the city of Recife, a mudslide buried a home and killed three people, including a pregnant woman. Emergency workers have been put on alert since the rain began. The northeastern state of Minas Gerais is one of the worst hit this year, with 312 people killed in flood-related accidents, state media reported. In the state of Goias, 373 people have been killed in rains. The disaster has caused the closure of some roads.

The newspaper, citing police sources and reports on Internet sites, said some 300 people had been arrested and more than 60 people had been hospitalized with injuries. The Herald said some of the protesters were armed with bats and rocks, and officers fired rubber bullets at those who resisted the eviction. The Herald said the city's mayor called on Haitian officials to ""stop this senseless violence and the violence that is destroying the lives of innocent Haitians."" He said the city would reopen its streets Sunday, the newspaper said. ""The Carnival, the world's largest street festival, began just over a year ago and has been held in Miami since 1993. It has been held in the city since 2000. The Herald said the Carnival is considered by the United Nations to be an important part of Haitian culture and festivalgoers must stay at home for the duration of the event without interruption. The Herald said authorities were deploying 30,000 police to ensure public safety."" Carnival Parade is a social event that brings visitors from around the world together to celebrate the historic and cultural heritage of Haitian people, ""a statement released by the Carnival said.

Meanwhile, the Port-au-Prince area of Haiti's capital has been placed on lockdown because of concerns that people are not going to return home for the Carnival, the Herald said. The Herald said if the protests continue, the city's planned street festival could be scrapped. The Herald said residents of the slums have been organizing against the influx of migrants visiting the city.

486,"Police in Panama found more than 5 tons of drugs in a homemade semi-submersible vessel that was carrying fake drugs in Panama's Atlantic coast, the country's attorney general said on Tuesday. Prosecutors have begun an investigation into the seizure of the ship named the ""El Caribe,"" which was reported to have had been transporting the drugs for what the attorney general's office described as a shipment of narcotics. Police seized five tons of hashish and 2.6 tons of methamphetamine during the operation, the attorney general's office said in a statement. There were also five vehicles, the statement said. The attorney general's office did not give a possible motive for the shipment and did not give an exact value of the drugs seized. Authorities said the drugs were not made in Panama. The vessel was in the area of the city of Tecate, 30 miles (50 km) off Florida's west coast, the statement said. The interior minister of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, issued a statement on Tuesday condemning the seizure and said the government will seek answers from authorities in Panama and the United States. ""I am extremely gratified to be able to say that we have arrested the owner of this vessel,"" Varela said in a statement. I have the utmost confidence in our justice system and will not rest until our justice system is befitting its dignity. This whole episode only heightens my determination to continue with determination to bring swift justice to the victims of this crime.

488,"Murder of 7-year-old girl in Mexico fuels anger and protests over brutal killings of young women (VIDEO) - RT USA A 7-year-old girl was murdered and her body dumped in a remote area in Michoacan state, Mexico, after someone broke into a home and stole her pacifier. A man from the nearby town of Culiacan reportedly confessed to the crime. The girl's killer was also caught. The murder of the young girl, named only as Alexis, shocked the Mexican public, and furthered protests and claims that no one is being held accountable for the crime. The case has also generated a number of demonstrations, and even an assassination attempt. In the wake of the tragedy, thousands of people took to the streets of Mexico City and other cities across the country. Alexis ""body was found on Sunday in the town of El Romero, which lies in western Mexico. Local media were informed that the victim was found with multiple bullets in her chest and head. The daughter's parents were questioned as suspects by police, but had refused to testify as a witness, state prosecutors said. Two suspects were also detained, without leaving a trace.

The father then reportedly admitted to the crime, according to La Jornada newspaper. The crime comes amid a number of other high-profile incidents that have led to increased media attention in Mexico over the past few days. Last week, two teenagers allegedly killed a 13-year-old student and buried her in the same Mexican village, and another woman was allegedly raped and strangled on the streets of Mexico City. One of those cases triggered protests and accusations that"" no one is being held to account ""for the crime.

The virus is spread by the Aedes mosquito, which is found in tropical and subtropical regions. The two people already identified as having developed the virus are a 42-year-old man in the Miami area and a 45-year-old woman who lived in a Miami-Dade County township, the CDC said. Both had not traveled to a Zika-affected area. The CDC is also working with federal, state and local health officials to identify the person. The agency said they had not been tested for Zika, which is spread through mosquito bites and can cause severe illness. It is the first time the virus has been linked to microcephaly, a condition that can result in babies being born with abnormally small heads and brain damage. The CDC said the two people who were associated with the Florida case are likely infected with the virus at least every two months as they live in the same area. A Zika outbreak was declared in the southern U.S. state of South Carolina earlier this month. The virus is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. It is one of the most common viruses that can lead to severe birth defects and causes severe birth defects in newborns. Health officials in Florida have been trying to establish a link between the Zika virus and microcephaly, which can cause babies to be born with abnormally small heads and brain damage. The CDC said the agency is working with its local partners to determine how to deal with other cases. The Florida Department of Health and Florida State Health Department are working together to identify the people who may be infected with the Zika virus. According to the CDC, there are approximately 1,200 cases of microcephaly in the United States, and this is the most common cause of birth defects in infants. The Zika virus is also found in areas of the Caribbean, Central and South America and South America, it said."
490,"Ronaldinho under investigation in Paraguay over 'fake' passports claims Former Barcelona forward Ronaldinho is being investigated for fraud in Paraguay over allegations he made misrepresentations about his name and current country, Argentina's foreign ministry said on Wednesday. According to Argentine daily La Nacion, the Brazilian had fake documents at his home in the capital Asuncion in August and September, which were then used to obtain a passport to travel to Argentina. The paper said the documents included a fake ID card and a fake ID card used by his mother in Paraguay. A ministry official told AFP it had sent a complaint to the Paraguayan anti-fraud agency. Ronaldinho was a member of the Barcelona side that won the 2005 Champions League final against Bayern Munich. Argentina, a country with a population of just over 14 million, is one of the world's leading exporters of soccer, having won the Copa America in 2009. Several other major football leagues in South America have also come under scrutiny over their sponsorship of the Brazilian-based football league. Brazil's state-run television network Globo said this week that it would cut payments to a number of Brazilian sponsors, including Petrobras, which is linked to the country's oil firm Petrobras, because of the impact on the country's image. Brazil is set to host the World Cup in 2014 in Brazil. Brazil's government has been undergoing an investigation into whether it gave money to award-winning US businessman Jack Warner in return for his support after he received a company bid, which was ultimately rejected. FIFA has opened a separate probe into the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively. Brazil's government said last month it was ""deeply concerned"" about the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, in part because of the country's alleged involvement in the building of the stadiums. The country's state-run advertising firm Publico was also implicated in the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. A statement from the Brazilian government said it was ""in the final stages of this investigation."" The Brazilian Football Confederation confirmed it had received a complaint but said it was awaiting the findings of the investigation. It also said its ""relationship"" with the government of Paraguay had not been suspended. Brazil's government said last month it was ""deeply concerned"" by allegations made in a report by the US-based firm Mossack Fonseca."
491,"Colorful Carnival celebrations around the globe in 2020 The annual New Year's Day parade takes place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where revelers light the city's tree leaves during a ""Carnival of Candy"" parade. The parade marks the start of the new year, when many people around the world celebrate the start of the new year's festivities. The tradition goes back to the Roman Catholic year of St. Paul the Great, which would have been celebrated on Jan. 29, 1902, by the King of Spain, James II. This year, revelers are opting for the theme of ""Beyond the Fear of Fear,"" a reference to the fear of terrorism. Organizers of the parade in Rio say residents of several neighborhoods in the city have organized the celebrations in anticipation of terrorism. Several hundred police officers are on duty to maintain order. This year, the city has been preparing for its annual Carnival of Candy, a parade that will feature thousands of floats, parades and street food. New York City, New York, Honolulu, Tokyo, and even London will be hosting the celebration. This year, the event will feature more than 30 floats, musical performances, and a fireworks display. ""Everyone is really excited to start the new year and make New Year's Eve a wonderful celebration!"" the organizers of the parade wrote on Facebook. The 2017 Carnival of Candy will be held on Feb. 28, 2020, from 8: 30 a.m. to 3: 30 p.m. in Rio de Janeiro. Tickets have been on sale for the event for around a month, in order to make the event more inexpensive for families. In January, Rio switched to a time-honored event: the ""carnival of the planet,"" as it's known by locals. The celebration is the culmination of the four-day Carnival parade, which began in 1916. The tradition has lasted more than a century, with a number of festivals over the years. This year's celebration includes a parade on New Year's Day, a parade on New Year's Day, a parade on New Year's Day, and a parade down Copacabana Beach on New Year's Day. ""Carnival of Candy,"" which is part of New York City's Carnival traditions, is an art project that started in 1915 and ends on Jan."
492,"Uganda restricts travel from 16 countries including UK and US because of coronavirus Ugandan authorities have restricted travellers from 16 countries including the UK and the US to Uganda after the deadly coronavirus outbreak. Uganda's Health Ministry said it would restrict travel from the affected countries to the capital, Kampala. The new restrictions are in addition to measures already in place so that visitors can continue to arrive in Uganda after the country's national holidays, the government said. The latest outbreak has so far claimed the lives of four adults in Uganda, and has been described as the largest recorded in the history of the disease. The country's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has warned the risk of the virus spreading through the air is ""extremely high."" Five Britons have also been diagnosed with the virus, which causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea and is spread on direct contact with the blood. A further three cases have been confirmed in the UK, all of whom have developed symptoms. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday that the likelihood of a global pandemic increased over the next 48 hours. The WHO urged countries to be aware of the risks of infection and to be aware of efforts to contain the outbreak. On Monday, UK health authorities said their first case of an outbreak in the UK had proved negative. The latest patient, a woman in her 60s, was diagnosed with the virus after returning from an African tour. She was admitted to hospital in London on Saturday morning and is now stable, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said. The woman was admitted to the Royal Free Hospital on Sunday morning and is now stable. The HPA said the nurse who tested the patient and has been discharged from hospital has since been discharged and has been advised to continue with her work-related activities. The United States is also closely monitoring the situation, with the CDC warning that the outbreak could spread to 15 US states. The first cases of the disease in the US were reported in Kansas on Saturday. The first case was reported in Florida on June 15, and five other cases were reported in North Carolina, New Jersey, Wisconsin and Massachusetts on Saturday. Health officials said there was currently no evidence to suggest the virus was transmitted through contact with a person or animal. The HPA has also said that pregnant women were most at risk. Coronaviruses are a type of flu that is passed by hand from person to person."
493,"Rare white giraffes killed by poachers at Kenyan wildlife sanctuary The two giraffes were shot dead at the park in Nairobi's East Village in an attack by poachers who have killed nine of the animals since November. The park is home to more than 20,000 people, with more than 100 breeding zones. It is one of the most popular places for tourists to find rare African animals in the bush and is the largest inhabited and protected park in Africa. ""We must never forget that these animals are animals which we have lost but to lose them in the bush is even more heartbreaking,"" said Issa Tchiroma, the executive director of the Kenya Wildlife Service. Park keepers have been monitoring the giraffes' movements and ""working together to protect their habitat,"" he said. The two giraffes were discovered dead on Friday after two men attacked them. The men tried to steal the animals and hid them in a nearby reserve. It is believed that the giraffes were shot with rifles or knives. ""I am very sorry,"" one of the men, Sekai Gubane, told a local television station. He said that he had taken them to the park with the intention of releasing them into the wild in Kenya. The park is in the western part of the African continent. A spokeswoman for the Wildlife Service said the animals were the first reported white giraffes shot dead inside the park in 14 years. ""The white giraffe species in Kenya have been in the park since 1996,"" she said. The park is free to visitors and there are no plans to put any lions, zebras or giraffe into the park. These animals are protected by conservation groups, and are not endangered, but there is a high threat of poaching. Last year, a pair of white giraffes were found shot dead in the same area. In 2008, two giraffes were killed at a wildlife reserve in the city of Mombasa in a similar attack. The young animals were believed to have been ""dumped"" into a shallow trench by poachers who had killed the animals. Kenya has seen a rise in the number of white giraffes in the past few years, with about 30% of African wild animals now in zoos. But the population is estimated to be down to around 1,000."
494,"Jubilation as Congo discharges last Ebola patient from Kailahun hospital After a week in quarantine, a Congolese doctor has been discharged from the Ebola treatment center where he was placed in isolation, a WHO official said on Tuesday. The patient, who has not been named, had been in isolation at the Kailahun center in Bikoro since late March. ""I am very grateful to the Congolese authorities for having saved our man's life,"" the 40-year-old doctor said in a statement. The hospital had made a big step towards the end of its three-month lockdown by turning the Ebola patient's isolation room into an Ebola treatment unit. Another patient, a 23-year-old Nigerian named Thomas Eric Duncan, was placed in isolation in late March but has since left the hospital. Reporting by Pete Jones; Editing by Alison Williams and Andrew Heavens A convoy of ambulances arrives at the Kailahun Ebola treatment center in Bikoro on March 30. Photo: Pascal Rossignol / AFP / Getty Images A hospital spokesman said on Tuesday that one of the patients that had been admitted was in good condition, and two others had been discharged from Kailahun. The United Nations has criticised Congo for failing to properly monitor the outbreak. The WHO has said it was a ""major event."" Congo's new leader, Joseph Kabila, has accused the United States of exaggerating the outbreak and has said the outbreak is a worldwide health emergency. International experts have said it could be years before Congo is declared Ebola free, although the WHO says its ""rapid"" response has been successful. The Congolese government has said it has not yet diagnosed the disease. ""We have not identified the source of the disease yet,"" Congo's information minister, Lambert Mende, told AFP by telephone earlier on Tuesday. ""The problem is that we have not seen the source,"" Mende said. The virus, which is spread through bodily fluids of infected people, is transmitted by contact with the bodily fluids of infected people, and is usually transmitted through contact with bodily fluids of sick people. The WHO says it has nearly eradicated the disease in the country, but says healthcare workers are stretched to their limits in the remote areas and there is a high risk of Ebola transmission."

496,"Nigeria says it is ready and more than capable of dealing with coronavirus outbreaks, as the number of cases reached a record high and several hospitals have reported outbreaks of the virus. The virus was confirmed in a 14-year-old Nigerian boy who died in Lagos, Nigeria, last week. The boy's death follows that of a Nigerian schoolgirl who died in Texas. The girl was infected with the virus after visiting Dallas. Nigeria is a major importer of the MERS virus and was hit by the worst global outbreak of the virus in 2012, when it killed about 800 people. This week, President Muhammadu Buhari declared the outbreak over. The United Nations says it is ""one of the most pressing global health challenges in recent decades."" The World Health Organization's chief, Margaret Chan, said all countries on the list must step up their efforts to fight the disease. ""The numbers of new infections in Nigeria have increased tremendously, and we now have a great opportunity for Nigeria to put in place measures to prevent future outbreaks, including strengthening its emergency response,"" Chan said. ""We are particularly concerned that a new outbreak of MERS could be brought to Nigeria in the near future,"" she added. The new patient was first diagnosed on 13 May and initially identified in Saudi Arabia. Doctors said he had travelled to the Middle East and then to Kuwait, where he came down with a fever. He was treated with antibiotics, and remains in hospital. Nigeria is the world's second-largest importer of the virus after Saudi Arabia, and it is estimated that between 25 and 30% of the world's population are infected with the disease. The WHO said that, in the case of Nigeria, it was likely that the virus could have originated in a patient from the Middle East. A spokesperson for the World Health Organization said: ""The Nigerian authorities are working with their partners to establish the cause of the outbreak."" The BBC's Sammy Darko in Lagos says there are fears that MERS could spread on the transport networks of Nigeria as it is spread close to large urban centres. MERS is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus, the same strain that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which has killed over 100 people in a global epidemic. According to the World Health Organization, it is a respiratory disease caused by coronaviruses."
497,"Lesotho Prime Minister in surprise court appearance as lawyers seek immunity The court heard that Ms Amantha had been arrested on October 11. A day later, during a bail hearing, she was handed over to police. Prosecutors said she was being held at a prison near the capital, Nairobi. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ""We are aware of reports that Lesotho Prime Minister Sene Tienabee was detained for several hours ago on charges of making false statements in relation to allegations of bribe-taking. We are providing consular assistance to Mr Tienabee and are in touch with our embassy. Ms Amantha has been in power since 2003, but her cabinet has been accused of corruption after a number of high-ranking ministers were arrested in 2008 and 2009. The allegations include the murder of a prominent political ally in 2008. The allegations have never been proven. Ms Amantha's lawyers had argued for her release pending trial, arguing she had been held without charge for the past four years. Ms Amantha had been unavailable for comment. She has previously warned that the nation's courts can become a"" Wild West for all those involved. ""The country is in the midst of a constitutional crisis over the succession to power of the nation's first monarch. The ruling party has said it will hold new elections in 18 months, but opposition parties have accused the government of using dirty tricks to cling to power. The country's first prime minister, George Weah, was assassinated in July 2006 during a rally in Maputo, a poor land-locked country of roughly 400,000 people, and only two years ago, he was declared a candidate for the presidency, but his rival, Albert Bongbong, was given a run-off vote. In 2011, the Supreme Court ruled that the prime minister could not retain the presidency for five years, after a court ruled against a challenge by his wife. Mr Weah was sworn in as prime minister in December that year and became the country's youngest leader when his father, Albert, died in December at the age of 71. He became the country's first leader since its independence in 1962 and has since led the country's transition to democracy. He has been prime minister since 2009. In 2010, a former prime minister, Michael Sata, was sentenced to 20 years in jail for corruption and defying the Maldivian government when he sought to remove Ms Amantha from the office."
498,"Dutch government returns stolen 18th-century 'precious crown' to Ethiopia The Ethiopian government has returned a 17th-century silver crown that was taken from the Netherlands ""parliament, and is now held in the country's southeast as a status symbol. The treasure was displayed at a meeting of Ethiopian and Dutch scholars on Monday in Addis Ababa, the capital, and is now held in a private museum in the capital - albeit inside a state archive. The crown, which has been in situ for 11 years, was taken from parliament in 2015 as part of a $16m loan requested by the Dutch government to help it to support the rebuilding of the now-defunct parliament, AFP reported. The crown was"" once, it was taken from the parliament, it is now held in the country's southeast, ""the Ethiopian foreign ministry said in a statement. Ethiopian prime minister Hailemariam Desalegn said the crown is"" a part of his country's heritage. ""Officials from the Dutch royal family have been visiting the museum to discuss the situation in the country, which was reunited with the country in 1991 following the genocide in December of that year. The Dutch decision to return the crown was"" a symbolic gesture, ""Mr Hailemariam said."" The country's history speaks of a strong and vibrant sovereign heritage, ""he said. The Ethiopian government has been campaigning to return the crown, which is in the possession of the National Museum of Ethiopia, and said it would have a host of other statues, antiquities and objects. The country's government, however, has struggled in recent years to rebuild its tattered parliament, since accusations of negligence were levelled against members of the current government and some of its senior officials. In May, the head of Ethiopia's Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Archbishop Siih Tsige, was arrested in Amsterdam on suspicion of embezzlement. He has denied the charges and has called for his release, according to the Ethiopian government. The Netherlands has asked the US to extradite Mr Tsige, who is wanted in the US for"" alleged involvement in a case of corruption, money laundering and money-laundering, ""according to the Dutch foreign ministry.

500,"African countries at severe risk if outbreaks aren't detected early, says Africa CDC head The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the country with the largest number of case outbreaks is currently Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. One of the two countries worst affected by the outbreak, Liberia has been declared Ebola-free, but the situation remains deadly in its first outbreak. ""The outbreaks here in Liberia and Sierra Leone have been in addition to the ones that have occurred in these three,"" said a WHO spokesman. We need to detect them very rapidly so we can prevent this from happening again. We have some way to go. If the outbreak is not detected earlier and the number of deaths is lower, there is a very real chance it could be the deadliest ever. The WHO has warned that the outbreak could spread to countries as far afield as Asia and North America. Nigeria, Libya, and Guinea are some of the countries worst-hit by the outbreak. The outbreak in Liberia is also being monitored, and the country has been declared free of the disease, while Sierra Leone's has now been declared free of the virus. Nigeria has made steady progress in containing the outbreak, and Sierra Leone has been declared free of the disease. The WHO has said that ""the situation is a serious threat to public health."" The WHO is monitoring closely for the risk of a resurgence of the disease. In the current outbreak there is no vaccine. The virus is the most commonly contracted strain of Ebola. It is spread by contact with the bodily fluids of its victims. The virus can also be transmitted by contaminated blood or secretions of fluids. The World Health Organization declared the Ebola outbreak over in March. The outbreak began in Guinea in September and spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone in December. In Liberia, more than 200 people have died from the disease. The US has been the largest donor to the WHO and is the largest contributor to a fund to fight the disease. It has also contributed $284 million to the organization since an initial response in December. The disease is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of Ebola victims. Since then the disease has spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Guinea. More than 5,000 people have died from the disease since the outbreak began in Guinea in December 2013. The world is now facing three days of Ebola."

The patient, who had travelled from South Africa, had been taken to hospital on Tuesday, as a precaution following ""a medical problem"" at the private Mutare Hospital, the minister Bright Matonga told reporters. The man said he had been suffering with the intestinal illness for some time and had been brought to the center on Wednesday night. He was taken to the hospital for a CT scan and an MRI on Thursday, Matonga said. He said the patient had now tested negative in a second test but he did not say when. He said the man had been admitted to the hospital on Wednesday night and was discharged on Thursday morning. The man was being treated under the care of a doctor, Matonga said, adding that the hospital was investigating the circumstances of his absconsion. The patient was taken by car from Mutare to the centre in the southern town of Bulawayo to be treated. He was brought there by ambulance and taken to Bulawayo where he was kept in isolation, Matonga said. The new case brings the number of people diagnosed with the virus in Zimbabwe to 173, including two known to have died in the same hospital, the health ministry said in a statement on its website this week. It said more than 500 cases had already been reported in the capital Harare and neighboring province of Matabeleland. No further updates were immediately available. Zimbabwe's health minister, Simba Makoni, said on Monday the World Health Organisation (WHO) was investigating the cases of two Zimbabwean nurses who had contracted the virus from one of the country's citizens. The two nurses were admitted for precautionary checks on Thursday and were released but will be quarantined for 21 days. Earlier this month, a 92-year-old man died in a hospital in South Africa from the highly contagious cholera virus.

Ongare, 21, who is recovering from a knee injury, is in Sydney preparing for the upcoming Commonwealth Games. ""My body is still in a really good place and I'm looking forward to getting out and competing,"" she said. Ongis said the most important thing is that the health of her baby is all that matters, and is not just about her Olympic gold medal. ""My body is really not my only concern right now,"" she said. I have a lot of girls who are very strong and strong and I want to have big, strong girls that bounce back from adversity. The biggest thing for me is that I want to be good at boxing. I want to be at the Olympics. Ongis and Holcomb will compete in the women's 1500m final on Saturday. And Holcomb said she hopes for a strong showing in the 1500m final. ""I'm happy with the 1500m and I want to make up for the gold,"" Holcomb said. I was just happy with the event. I'm excited with my performance. Holcomb was one of three athletes chosen for the 1500m final. The others were Christine Ohuruogu of Britain, Olympic champion Jenn Stuczynski of the United States and defending world champion Carmelita Jeter of the Bahamas. The American, who won two golds at the World Championships in Daegu, said she saw other athletes like Aries Merritt of the United States and Jamaica's Usain Bolt as her true rivals.

506,"Bollywood and Nollywood collide in a tale of a big fat Indian-Nigerian wedding and a beautiful, multicoloured Indian woman named Rani, played by Kriti Kapoor. So what comes of the Bollywood spectacle? For me the film is a kind of celebration of life in India. It's like the opening of a book. There are Indian characters: you know, the Indian film industry. There are also characters from countries that have suffered from poverty and had to fight each other. You can have a different reality, a different colour, a different idea of life in India. But, in one way, I really enjoyed the experience. The film is so big, so moving, so full of life, so powerful. Now I just have to get used to it a bit. It's a new challenge for me because I'm in a period, and a lot of me are coming out. But, for me at least, it was good. I did a lot of research. I came to New York to do the movie, but I decided that the Indian film is not for me. I decided that I wanted to do a film that was big and very good. As for ""The Exorcist,"" I was talking to myself for some time. I said, 'If it happens, I should take it. The idea is that every time you have a film, you have some kind of space in your heart so you can get a good sense of how it will end. I don't think I had that right in my heart. I was never a big fan of that film. If it had a certain sort of energy, I would say maybe it could have been better. But if it's too emotional, or it's too big, then of course we have to learn to make it again. But, for me at least, it was a proper film, and I'm enjoying it.

507,"South Africans in Wuhan lockdown call for evacuation South Africans in Wuhan have called on the government to evacuate their homes in case of a landslide. Residents in the city, which is already extremely saturated in the flood water, have called for the city's residents to stay indoors. As many of those living in the area know, rain is not always a good thing. ""We're not allowed to leave our homes because of the flooding,"" said one resident. People in the area may not know the exact area and the water is very heavy. The authorities are also trying to divert people's attention from flooding. A police spokesperson said there was a risk of landslides but that the situation was being monitored. Wuhan authorities said people living in the area should stay indoors. It is not yet clear if the streets will be flooded. Some have already moved to temporary shelters. South Africa's Flood Recovery Agency (South African Red Cross) has been called in to help with the relief. It said it would provide water purification tablets and food for people who have lost their homes. Wuhan, China's most populous city, is one of the country's worst hit regions. It has been hit by flooding in the past, but this year's downpours have been worse than usual. In 2016, the city's worst floods in some 50 years killed more than 250 people and displaced millions. Some 300,000 people in the region have been affected by flooding over the last few years. Image copyright AFP Image caption Thousands of people in the city have been affected by flooding in 2016.

508,"Caught between roadblocks, they were sitting ducks for Boko Haram massacre victims. ""These were people who are tired and they're desperate for something,"" said one survivor, who asked not to be named. We weren't just there to see what's going on. We're here to help. The attacks were the latest in a series of violent insurgent attacks in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation. Boko Haram, whose name means ""Western education is sacrilege,"" has killed thousands of people since 2009. The group is believed to have recruited some of its members in neighboring countries, including Cameroon, Chad and Niger, according to U.S. estimates. The group has also carried out attacks in neighboring countries, including in neighboring Nigeria, Nigeria's neighbor to the north. Boko Haram's name is a mixture of Arabic and English, and its leader is believed to be based in the southern Nigerian province of Borno. A government official said Saturday that troops killed Boko Haram's commander in Maiduguri, identified as Mohammed Yusuf, in an army raid in a village near Maiduguri on Friday. Yusuf was reportedly killed in the ensuing firefight with troops. Yusuf is a notorious leader of Boko Haram who was based in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state. The authorities in Borno state have been cracking down on the group, arresting hundreds of people in its strongholds in areas where they use suicide bombers to carry out attacks. In central Nigeria city Baga, local government officials said a suicide bomber killed at least 30 people on Friday. The extremists have also been using women and children as suicide bombers. The United States condemns the violence and calls on Boko Haram to stop its attacks on civilians. The Nigerian military said it has killed as many as 500 suspected militants since the start of the year. Boko Haram controls a small section of Borno and neighboring Adamawa states, making it the group's most brutal stronghold in the region. It is also estimated to have hundreds of fighters in neighboring countries. U.S. Army Col. Larry Nicholson said at a news conference Friday that the Nigerian military has killed or captured more than 50 militants in recent weeks. ""We don't have a complete picture yet, but Boko Haram has attacked a wide range of targets and we're in the process of killing them,"" Nicholson said."
509,"This South African pilot is on a mission to change the face of aviation in Africa What's the future? With the arrival of airline alliances in South Africa and India, the A320 and A320 are the mainstays of an increasingly sophisticated, high-tech transport system. So it's no surprise that one South African pilot is aiming to change the face of aviation. While there are currently only two of the world's most powerful passenger aircraft, the A320 and the A380 have long been the dominant aircraft in the market. But the long-haul carriers have been expanding their planes to meet the needs of the rapidly growing aviation market. Euronews correspondent Juliette Binoche reports from Johannesburg: South African pilot Andre Ngoma has set out to change the face of aviation in Africa. He's teamed up with a group of international aviation groups. ""Africa is a very important market, but there are few airlines who are able to compete with us when it comes to this market,"" said Andre Ngoma. ""The most promising thing that we've done so far is start with Airbus,"" he continued. We started with A320 and A380, and as a result the market for the latter have grown dramatically. So we're now more able to compete with the world's best operators. In order to ensure we have the fastest-growing markets in the world, our planes are built on Airbus airplanes. So for the A320, we are basically building them on Airbus aircraft. So we are building our own. We are creating an aircraft that is very much the most efficient airliner. So we are building the best products for the world. And we are trying to revolutionise the aviation industry. So our best-performing airplanes are the ones that have the lowest fuel burn and the lowest carbon footprint. So we are bringing that in to the market now. And the A320, which is a mainstay of South African planes, is also the only Airbus aircraft that can go completely zero carbon. ""This is the first time a South African aerospace company has entered the market together with an international airline,"" said Andre Ngoma. And to realise that that is so important. In order to achieve that we are focusing on the very first commercial plane. So what kind of airline wants to do that? That is clear, from the discussion we have here. And it is clear that the South African aviation industry is in a very unique position."
510,"This designer is creating fashion prints from maths equations and, unlike some designers, uses mathematical principles to understand how the money in the bank comes in. Mr Esteves said his designs are meant to be seen in a way that's ""not a mathematical exercise."" ""The only reason we do this is for the people of Brazil, not for a specific company,"" he said. It's only the Brazilian people who are developing it. The Brazilian designers have shown the world they are different. The Brazilian designer was inspired by the Brazilian state, which has been plagued by corruption and other problems for decades. ""Brazil is not a mafia state,"" Mr Esteves said. They are not corrupt. He said: ""The corrupt are able to make hundreds with very little risk. We are a country of people who have been exposed to corruption, and we are still exposed in a very big way. Brazil is not about maths. It's not about engineering. It's about getting people to understand that we want them to use our technology for a reason, or whatever it is. Mr Esteves recently won a competition to design at the annual International Design Awards, held to celebrate the international fashion industry. The competition was called the"" Best in Africa. ""The judges decided that the designer was the best, as well as the best in Europe."" The design of the design reflects the type of approach that the designers have taken, ""Mr Esteves said. I think especially in the fashion industry the design of that has been very focused on creating something new for the consumer, to try to create new ideas. It is the first time the award has been given to a designer in the category, and even more so for a Japanese designer. Mr Esteves said he was also"" very proud ""of the design that was chosen."" I think it resonates with the consumer, ""Mr Esteves said. We can show that fashion is not just for the rich and famous. It's for everyone who loves fashion. You can buy them for very low prices or for hundreds of thousands. It is a good example of how we can all continue to help each other. My design for the Brazilian designer is an improvement on real life. It shows a lot of strength that I think it can inspire the whole world. Both Mr Esteves and Mr Esteves said they considered the competition as a way to improve business opportunities."
511,"Senegal launches wind power plant as part of its commitment to renewable energy Senegal has launched a pilot project aimed at installing renewable energy on a 1,200 square-kilometer (550-acre) island in the Atlantic Ocean. The project is led by Italian power company Enel and started in 2013 at a cost of about $165 million. The island will be managed by Italian energy firm Enel and will be used to generate electricity from renewable sources such as wind and solar power. It will be connected to the grid through sea wall panels. Enel said the project would be funded through a grant from the Italian government's Energy Program. The island is part of a 15-year, $20 billion renewable energy agreement for Senegal. The island will be built with wind and solar power, which will be more easily connected to the grid. Renewable energy development is one of the next biggest challenges for Senegal as it's under pressure to reduce its dependency on fossil fuels. Its oil production has been falling and Senegal has been accused by some Western countries of contributing to climate change with its huge offshore oil deposits. The country is also a major exporter of energy, but has been hampered by rampant corruption and a lack of domestic alternative sources. A recent survey by the World Economic Forum estimates that Senegal's energy production fell by 33 percent between 2007 and 2015, with its remaining oil potential under-estimated. The island is part of a broader strategy to reduce imports of oil by 40 percent and increase the renewable energy capacity of the country. It has also been under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to get more credit to help its economy recover from the global financial crisis. Senegal and neighboring Guinea, a country with an iron ore reserves estimated at more than 7 billion barrels, are two of Africa's main crude oil producers. The country also has a heavy industry which has been hit by the plunging price of crude and the huge loss of oil from its onshore fields. President Macky Sall has also pledged to reduce the country's dependence on natural gas to around 12 percent by 2020, from around 27 percent before his predecessor, Abdoulaye Wade, took office. Wade is now a member of the National Assembly. He has pledged to tackle climate change and the fight against terrorism. Senegal is committed to renewable energy but has also pledged to cut its carbon emissions to zero by 2020."

513,"How architect Mariam Kamara is masterminding a sustainable future for Niger - in pictures The director of the Niger Construction Company, Mariam Kamara, has recently returned from a four-year stint in Ethiopia, where she had reconstructed what was once a town. ""I wanted to know the history of the people and what was happening in the town,"" she says, ""whether it was the government intervening directly in the economy, or whether it was the people being forced to accept the authority of their masters to make the changes that they were being accused of."" Kamara's vision for sustainable growth in Niger is being exhibited at the National Institute of Architecture in Niger and the National Museum in the capital, Niamey. Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world, with one in four children living in poverty. The government has a zero-tolerance policy towards corruption, and many Niger businessmen are discouraged from working in the construction industry. Kamara has helped rebuild the town of Ngouboua, which had been destroyed by the looting of gold and diamonds in 2009, and is now home to a school for girls for the first time in 20 years. The project has been funded by Niger's National Museum, and has the aim of creating the basis for a sustainable economic model in the country. Photographs: Mariam Kamara.'Tsunami 'by Mariam Kamara.

514,"20 best things to do in Kenya: travel advice You've got to get to some places fast. If you're lucky, your main chance of being stopped is by the police. At the start of the year, they were trying to do away with the stop and search rule. The new policy is being rolled out across Kenya, however, as the country is being rocked by a wave of violent attacks and attacks on businesses and government offices. The focus of the country's police is to stop criminals. A lot of the money we spend on police is for us to stop and search, ""says Ali Nyamitwe, a spokesman for the Kenya National Police (KNPF), which is responsible for policing the capital, Nairobi. Nairobi is the world's busiest airport. Last year, there were 837 arrests in the city - up from 686 in 2014, according to the KNPF."" That's a total of 1,570 arrests a day, ""says Nyamitwe."" If you're travelling on a public transport you're at the airport, you can't do anything, and you're at the airport with two persons in a car, ""he adds. There is also a threat from people who don't go along with the traffic. Kenyan police are unable to make arrests of people being arrested if they're carrying cash."" If you have a car, you're at the airport with a gun, ""Nyamitwe warns. If you are carrying a gun in your hand, you're at the airport. Presumably, police are thinking of a number of measures to combat the threat, including increasing in-flight service. The KNPF is also encouraging tourists to buy large electronic devices that will allow them to make calls, send text messages, file documents and even check their emails.

515,"Incredible pictures capture rare 'Elephant Queen' in Kenya These are the remarkable shots of a rare elephant which looks just like a regular person - but with a tiny lump. Photographer Patrick Chan travelled around the country capturing the remarkable animal, which he says is also known as the 'Elephant Queen' because of her distinctive curved tusks and long, tusks. It is thought that the elephant's tusks cause their tusks to be smaller and therefore scare away predators. The tusks can grow up to 4ft long but are rarely spotted in the wild. They can grow to 6ft when fully grown and are often spotted in Kenya. Patrick Chan spent several weeks travelling across Kenya and Zimbabwe capturing these images The elephant, which has the tusks of 1,636lbs, is the largest living mammal in Africa. Patrick, from Montreal, Canada, said: 'It's amazing to see and be surrounded by these majestic beasts. I was on a safari with the animal and I was lucky enough to take some amazing photos. All the elephants are the same size but they all have their tusks in one place and I wanted to show them that we are all different. They are not threatened or hunted and are instead just a pride of lions, there is nothing else like their tusks. They are wonderful to photograph, they are all very playful. The elephants were then moved to local sanctuaries where they received care and rehabilitation. Patrick added:' I am also fortunate to have experienced some incredible wildlife and have witnessed some amazing wildlife encounters. 'Elephants are the largest mammal on the planet, measured at 6ft tall. Their tusks are made of keratin, the same material used in human fingernails and hair which is absent in humans. They can grow up to 4ft long and are often seen in Kenya and Zimbabwe. They are often spotted in Kenya and Zimbabwe and are often seen in the country. Patrick also has a number of other work including his work for the Asian elephant breeding programme in Kenya and his photographic work for the Hong Kong wildlife charity, which aims to protect its endangered and threatened species.

It is a food-rich, rich, slow-cooked dish that people who don't love chicken can enjoy. It is also a rich, rich way to wind down a long day. Kola served many times in the past. It is a food that people who are well versed in, like kola, can actually taste, and that they can experience. It is often served at home. In its current form, kola is also a staple of the region. Since Kola is sold in many Asian countries, like Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, it is available in the United States. In Taiwan, kola is a staple of many restaurants. For example, Kola is an all-day breakfast dish made with roasted chicken, tofu and rice. The custom is similar to traditional kola, a breakfast dish in which the meat is finished with a few pieces of saffron, a drizzle of whole grain bread and drizzle of tamarind powder.

And with a global demand for the tea in China expected to hit a record high in the next five years, and a growing number of countries in the region becoming tea-growing regions like India, South Africa and India, Mr Mabasa is aiming to raise the price.'It is in the Chinese interest for us to expand our base to serve these Chinese consumers,' he said. The South African tea industry has been seeking a 'blue-chip' investor to help expand production and a growing number of Chinese companies have expressed an interest in acquiring a stake in the sector. Mr Mabasa said South Africa is a great consumer market that is growing at such a pace that a large proportion of our production is exported. The tea industry has moved from being a traditional export market to a global one that is growing at a pace that is expected to double by 2020.'Our experience in this market is that the majority of our customers are not from the tea industry in South Africa, but they are from countries that are growing rapidly, 'he said. In terms of volume, South African tea market is expected to be worth $1.2billion in the next five years, while globally, it is forecast to reach $750million in 2020. And Mr Mabasa is confident that the tea market will continue to grow, despite the challenges that South Africa is experiencing. We have low levels of inflation in our country. Our export story is not just about tea. We produce more than three billion cups of tea in the South African tea industry and we have a real advantage over other tea exporters because South Africa is a growing tea tea exporter. And in order to continue to grow, we have to have a level playing field.'We also have the potential to grow our tea industry in a number of other countries, which is why we have started our own tea growing company - Jaffa Tea,' he said. The tea industry in South Africa is worth $3billion, and it is growing every year. Jaffa Tea's growth is expected to continue, as its plants are being improved to handle the increasing demand. And because the plant is being built at a site where tea is grown and packaged, could add much more production, Mr Mabasa said. I hope to have this plant up and running in around five years."
520,"The president of US Soccer steps down as he apologizes for legal document's language about child abuse The president of the US Soccer Federation has stepped down as he apologised for a language that referred to child abuse. In an apparently jocular post on his official Twitter account, president Sunil Gulati apologised for a speech he gave in 2015 in which he said the ""use of children as pawns in society"" would not be tolerated and that he would only ""speak with respect"" when necessary. Mr Gulati, who has been at the helm for 12 years, left his post on the day Soccer Australia released its report into match fixing. He said: ""It is with regret that I announce that following the completion of the independent investigation into the Australia's participation in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, I am stepping down as the president of the US Soccer Federation. In January 2015, I used a phrase that was not appropriate at the time. I wrote that words are not appropriate in private. The words that I said were unacceptable and do not reflect the values of our federation or its business. The apology came as a surprise to some. He stood by it and said it would have been a mistake to use it. In 2013, when Mr Gulati was the head of the US Soccer Federation, he faced legal action over what he said was an unsubstantiated allegation that he paid men to fix matches. Mr Gulati was not accused of any wrongdoing. In 2017, the US Justice Department filed an amicus brief, arguing that the document was unfairly used, but Mr Gulati was not part of the decision. The suit was later settled. Mr Gulati said that he had not been asked to leave and the reasons he resigned were not"" a political statement. """" The goal was to make a statement and I believe I did that, ""he said. In the statement, he said:"" But I do not find the language that was used to describe the way to which the US has dealt with this issue, or the way that we have dealt with it, to be unacceptable and I apologise. ""A statement from the US Soccer Federation said Mr Gulati's departure was"" a mutual decision. ""The organisation took Mr Gulati to an emotional memorial service in March, before then announcing he would not stand again for the presidency. Mr Gulati left Congress in 2014 to take up a posting as a legal adviser for the US Attorney's Office in Washington."
521,"Here's what Harvey Weinstein said in court before his 23-year sentence was handed down: ""I wish I could be more frank to myself. I wish I could have been more frank. I wish I could have been more honest to my children. I wish I could have said yes to all of the things that were said. I wish I could have been more frank. I wish I could have made a better choice. I wish I could have done things differently. Weinstein was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for the rest of his life. Now 34, Weinstein is serving a life term after being convicted in New York City of seven charges of sexual assault on more than 80 women. He denies all allegations of non-consensual sex against him. Weinstein's co-defendant, Georgina Chapman, is serving a life sentence for her role in the sexual assault of a teenage girl. Weinstein's attorney, Benjamin Brafman, told reporters outside court that a life sentence"" will never be enough ""and that his client had"" suffered enough. ""Brafman added:"" We intend to use all of the evidence that Ms. Chapman and Georgina Chapman have gathered to try and prove that in their own words ""this happened."" ""Weinstein, who is already serving time in prison in Arizona, has been refused bail. Chapman's lawyers had asked that her sentence be increased to life in prison. Prosecutors said that"" it is simply inconceivable that any sexual assault of any kind against any member of the clergy happened unless it occurred in the presence of the victim or anyone else. ""The pair pleaded guilty to 12 counts of rape, three of sexual assault, one of assault with a deadly weapon, and one count of forcible touching. The judge who sentenced Chapman, David Doty, did not comment on the sentence. Weinstein's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, made his first public statement since the case was made public, telling the media outside court that he was"" hopeful that a jury will see through their double standard, and take a second look at our client's criminal conduct. ""Chapman's lawyer added that he expected his client to be acquitted and that he would file a request for a review of the sentence. Weinstein's crimes were detailed in a report from the Manhattan district attorney's office. The report added that the criminal complaint against Weinstein was"" the most serious in the history of the office. """
522,"Homeless Californians join in a lawsuit to mandate Los Angeles provide shelter for thousands homeless people By John Blackstone, Los Angeles Times A group of homeless Los Angeles residents filed a federal lawsuit Thursday to try to force Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa to enact legislation establishing a national shelter for those who are homeless. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, said at least 1,200 people with disabilities have been housed in the area in recent years. The lawsuit, brought by the Alliance for Homeless Communities, seeks to protect the homeless and to redress the city's ""broken system of housing."" ""The city is failing its communities,"" said James P. Carleton, the executive director of the alliance. The city has systematically ignored homeless people, forced them into the streets, prevented them from accessing services and forced them to live in tents. The lawsuit said that the city had failed to prepare and employ enough staff to properly treat the homeless. Mayor Villaraigosa, who has championed the homeless since coming to office in 2002, has accused the group of ""pandering to the hateful rhetoric"" of some social conservatives. The mayor has asked the court to set aside a Feb. 8 ruling by a federal judge that found the city was not complying with its obligations under the law. The judge, Marilyn S. Berle of Federal District Court, said the city had no authority to enforce the law. Villaraigosa has said he believes the city has the legal authority to do so. But the city, county and state have said they need more time to find homes for the people who are homeless. ""It is unfortunate that an ongoing lawsuit cannot be resolved by the courts, leaving the homeless in the hands of the homeless themselves,"" said Councilman Richard Alarcon, who sponsored the law's passage. This case will have a bright future for the city. The suit seeks unspecified monetary damages. The city already provides services for the homeless, including housing and job training, but it said the city has failed to provide that support in the past. The city has said it will retrain staff and provide other assistance to homeless individuals. ""The city is reviewing its existing programs and services and will issue a plan for ongoing support,"" the suit said. The Los Angeles Times was not immediately able to reach the city for comment. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of California."
523,"Robert Durst found his friend's body and ran, attorney says, but he didn't pull the trigger Robert Durst has been found guilty of murdering a friend in New Orleans, but he didn't pull the trigger, his attorney said. Durst was found guilty of capital murder on Thursday, but he has lost an appeal. A Los Angeles judge dismissed a related appeal and ordered him to spend another 40 years behind bars. In a brief statement, Robert Durst's attorney claimed that his client didn't pull the trigger and his client had no reason to do so. Durst, 68, has been charged with killing Susan Berman, 71, at his Beverly Hills home in 2000. The murder was one of several gruesome murders in California that prompted widespread investigations into the criminal world. The other incidents were in Los Angeles, New York and the Midwest. ""Mr. Durst is disappointed and saddened that this entire legal process has become unnecessary and distasteful and should not be allowed to continue,"" Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said in the statement. The Dursts ""had been living a private life and had been planning a civil marriage for some time,"" DeGuerin said. Durst was arrested after Berman's body was found in his Los Angeles home in January 2001. The Los Angeles County district attorney had asked Durst for a new trial, arguing that prosecutors in Los Angeles failed to present sufficient evidence. In a letter, prosecutors said prosecutors ""failed to disclose any substantial evidence of a direct connection between the murder and Mr. Durst's efforts to evade detection."" A jury last month deadlocked on death penalty. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has appealed the verdict. The San Fernando Valley-born Durst, a key figure in the HBO series The Jinx, confessed to killing Berman. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. ""It's a sad day for Los Angeles,"" Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said before the verdict was announced. I hope the district attorney's office will take the time to study the verdict, and ultimately hear the evidence that they have. He said he hoped Durst would be returned to prison. I think he will get a fair trail and a fair trial. If that happens, and it looks like he did, it will be the end of the road for him, ""he said. I'm hoping that good will come of this."
524,"Major sports leagues in the US halt play or exclude fans over coronavirus outbreaks Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and the National Basketball Association have all said that players could be at risk if they are sick with the highly contagious H1N1 virus. World Health Organisation experts last month issued a global travel alert for children and pregnant women in an effort to contain the outbreak of the virus. In a statement, the league said: ""The NFL, Major League Baseball and the NBA have announced that they are taking the precautionary step of suspending a portion of their games for the foreseeable future in light of recent reports of a confirmed H1N1 virus outbreak in North America."" The NFL said that both the NHL and NBA have postponed all games this season but would not specify if the league would play a home game or the regular season. The NFL said that the cancellation of games and postponements was a ""precautionary measure."" The league, the NFL and NBA announced that they would be suspending games for this season but would not specify if the league would play a home game or the regular season. The NHL said that it had no plans to suspend games. ""As a result of the current media reports, we will not participate in the postseason,"" the league said in a statement. In addition, the league said that it would not play in the regular season. It said that the other 14 NHL teams were also considering their postseason plans. The league said that it would consider suspending games during the regular season if the flu is confirmed in the affected region. As well as the NBA, the US National Football League and the National Football League have also announced that they are suspending games for the rest of the season. The league said that it was closely monitoring the situation in Egypt for the possibility that any child born at the Egyptian league football stadium can contract the disease. The season opener between the Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago Cubs on April 5 has been postponed indefinitely as a precaution. Also last week a Canadian man who was recovering from his first case of the flu was admitted to hospital in Montreal after a doctor diagnosed him with H1N1. The man's symptoms were not common and he had no underlying health problems. However, he said that before he caught the virus he did not want to leave his hotel room. The next leg of the trip was to San Francisco on April"
525,"Coronavirus test: confusion over availability and criteria is leaving sick people wondering if they're infected, not sneezing or coughing. The NHS has been accused of hiding the information because of a row over who is responsible for labelling the illness. People in the affected areas are being told to get tested by health officials for any signs of the virus. But, in some areas, the advice is not being given, leaving those unsure whether they are infected. They are being told to call GP or NHS Direct if they have any questions about whether they have the virus, in order to be tested. But, as the NHS website says, ""Patients should always contact their GP or NHS Direct if they think they have the virus."" Health Minister Anna Soubry said: ""The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice) guidance is clear that it is a matter of medical necessity for people to be tested by a healthcare professional. We are also working with the NHS to help ensure that all patients are tested as soon as possible. The guidance is not based on evidence and it is not based on a doctor's test, but on a person's best interests and the best interests of their patient. The guidance is simply an appropriate tool to help the NHS identify and treat those at risk of the illness. More than 1.1million people are thought to be infected each year. Only a small proportion of those who develop a rash will go on to develop serious complications, such as diarrhoea. The HPA's report comes amid a growing row over the NHS's"" sneezing and coughing ""advice. Most NHS staff have already been given the advice by the Royal College of GPs and the National Obesity Forum. But in some areas many health professionals have been told by health trusts not to carry out the test, prompting fears that people may be being falsely told they are at risk of the condition. And some patients say they were wrongly told they were not at risk, or were being told they should get tested more often. The report, which is due to be published on Monday, says"" there is a perception that the NHS is underestimating the importance of vaccination and that the advice is inconsistent with the clear evidence on the risks of catching the virus. ""It adds:"" There are lessons in the NHS's approach to this issue. ""The figures, which have not yet been provided to BBC News, highlight the low"
526,"The 2020 census kicks off across the United States this week. It's expected to be the largest in US history. The 2020 census will feature more than 1 billion additional voters across the country. While Republicans argue the census is a waste of time and money, Democrats argue it is a critical part of protecting America's borders. The debate over census transparency has been on the rise in recent years, with Republicans warning about the potential for more voter fraud. More than 70 percent of Americans say they would ""definitely"" or ""probably"" vote in a 2020 presidential election based on the census, according to a recent Gallup poll. And the 2020 census won't be the first to use data from the 2010, 2012 and 2014 elections to rank candidates for the 2020 presidential election. It will also be the first to compare election results from the two previous presidential elections, where the top two finishers dropped out of the race after being repeatedly overlooked by their respective candidates. Some Republicans have sought to shift the 2020 election results. In a speech in 2016, Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said the 2020 census won't be an ""illusion"" because, ""I'm afraid it's not as accurate. I'm afraid it'll be a sideshow. Dayton's Republican party did not run unsuccessfully in 2010 for that slot. When the 2020 census was issued in 2011, it was to include the entire 15 states in the country. It was the culmination of several years of efforts to make the 2020 census more democratic. The 2020 census was originally set to launch in 2015, but a federal judge blocked it from happening. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration's request to block the 2020 census. On Twitter, the Justice Department also said it would not hear an appeal from the Trump administration before 2020. The 2020 census will also be released later this year.

527,"With coronavirus closing schools, here's how you can help food insecure children HAMPTON, Conn. -- With food insecure children closing schools, the CBS News health contributor Dr. Tara Narula is talking about the best way to help children who are unsure about what to eat. ""We're seeing a lot of schools that are closed because it's been taking a while for parents to know how to deal with this,"" Narula said, explaining that many students and teachers are concerned about the food they eat in school. ""You're saying that's just what's going on?"" asked Narula. ""I'm guessing that's the best way to handle that,"" she said. It's a very hard thing to do, and kids just don't know where to go when they're told about the news, and they're afraid to come home when they don't even know what to eat. The worst thing you can do is try to help. Narula said one of the best ways to help is through donation. She said it's a great idea to give to a school and give them a gift card for use in the school cafeteria. Last year, Narula helped save the life of a 5-year-old Connecticut boy who had a staph infection. ""That was kind of the last straw, the worst part, that he didn't know what to eat,"" Narula said. Her advice: ""Put a little money in the bank where the kids are and you can come in and buy some food."" Narula said if you donate to a school, you're going to get an incentive. You're not going to get any dollars back. So, it's not just about giving money, it's about helping them to improve. Narula's personal story is one of hope. ""It's about making it a little bit easier to feel good in your own skin,"" Narula said. It's about feeling good in your own body. It's about letting them know that you care, that your heart is on the right side of the line, that your blood pressure's good. And it's about letting them know that their health is really strong, that that their body is strong. Narula said she believes food insecure children are a little bit more vulnerable to it. In the past, we've heard from parents about food insecure children. Now, ""she said."

The White House said Obama's visit was to recognize the accomplishments of service members and their families. The bill also asks for $480 million in military funding to hire more doctors, nurses and medical staff, the White House said. It also calls for a grant of $1 billion in grants to states to hire and train more doctors and nurses and increase funding to establish a new national homelessness board to coordinate the deployment of mental health services, the White House said. The president also signed a bill to keep the Department of Veterans Affairs open until March 12, 2014. The bill would also provide $75 million in disaster relief as part of a larger package of funds, the White House said. President Obama was also expected to attend the annual National Prayer Breakfast, a bipartisan gathering that attracts leaders from the United States and around the world. The president has a busy week ahead of him, as he attends the G-20 summit in Argentina, meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin, visits the Department of Homeland Security in Washington, and speaks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Obama attended the Veterans of Foreign Wars memorial at Arlington National Cemetery on Wednesday.

529,"These states have been hit the hardest by coronavirus. Here's what they're doing to fight the spread of Norovirus Norovirus is common in hospitals and other public health facilities. ""It's a really difficult virus to fight,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University infectious diseases expert. The illness doesn't come easily, but it can be treated with an injection or saline solution. In hospitals, the virus is spread through coughing and sneezing, and coughing spreads easily, Schaffner said. What is most likely to happen is that sickened patients come to the hospital in the middle of the night. ""If you have symptomatic patients come to the hospital in the middle of the night, there's a good chance they're going to have norovirus,"" Schaffner said. And that makes the whole thing very, very dangerous. The CDC now recommends that anyone who gets sick between August 27 and September 30, and who shows symptoms between that date and the next, get the shot. People are advised to stay home until at least 48 hours after they get sick. The CDC also recommends that pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems stay home. It is possible that the virus could spread, too, if someone was in the hospital where infections are being reported. ""It could be that you have a sick person who has had contact with you,"" Schaffner said. The CDC recommends that anyone who has had contact with you get a flu shot.

530,"How US spy agencies are tracking the coronavirus pandemic, and how to prevent it from spreading. Codenamed H1N1, the virus is causing widespread alarm, and especially in South Asia. The WHO says the illness is widespread in Asia and has seen an unprecedented jump in cases in its southern hemisphere, from just over 700 to 1,800 in the last week alone. It has an aggressive reputation, with many countries introducing measures to contain it, which include spraying insecticides around schools. The virus, once thought to be highly contagious, has now spread to 36 countries, the WHO reports. Most of the countries affected are in the Asia-Pacific region, with the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand also affected. China - which is in the midst of its worst outbreak on record - has seen the worst number of cases so far, with 1,772 cases, followed by Thailand, with 1,674. The UN World Health Organisation says it is also ""concerned"" about the virus. ""WHO is currently working with a number of countries and agencies to combat coronavirus,"" it said. ""WHO is also following up on reports that the WHO has confirmed that the virus and associated coronavirus have mutated to become more contagious,"" it added. The WHO said that the US has confirmed cases in 19 states. There have been three deaths in the US, and five other cases in Canada. The virus has also spread to a hospital in Wisconsin, where a middle-aged man died of the illness after returning from an overseas trip. The man, who has not been named, was in charge of cleaning out the room where he had been staying at the University of Wisconsin Health. He is believed to have had contact with the patient, who was in isolation when the virus was first detected. Several countries have put in place emergency plans to deal with the disease. The US State Department has issued a travel warning, urging its citizens to be at least ""very cautious"" about going to parts of Mexico City and other areas of Mexico ""where the disease is spreading."" If you're in Mexico, do not have direct contact with the patient. The CDC says that it is not recommending travel to the US, but that it is ""extremely likely"" that the virus has mutated to become a more dangerous strain. People who have travelled to the affected countries should keep their temperature and hygiene under control, it adds."
531,"Annotated: Trump's Oval Office remarks on coronavirus What a difference a week makes! Trump tweeted after the news broke that he had an 'excellent' virus. His words were quickly seized by the media upon his return. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said: 'It's great news that President Trump will be spending a significant portion of his day in the Oval Office doing what he loves best - working with Congress to help prevent this disease from spreading to the American people.' The White House is committed to keeping America safe by keeping America safe, and I look forward to working with him as we work to ensure that we continue to protect Americans from this deadly disease. The president has already spoken of the need for increased federal funding as well as a need to work with Congress to make the health-care system work better. Trump also said on Monday that the White House would focus on the economy and jobs and would not be discouraged by a 'very rough' week. The White House also released a statement noting that the Trump administration is' spending more at the border than ever before, 'and was' working to provide a boost to the economy through a number of initiatives, including 'strong border security.' Although Trump's comments didn't directly address the healthcare battle, they have already stirred up opposition, which has led to both his administration's hardline stance and his controversial executive order. During his visit last week, Trump said he would 'drain the swamp' of Obamacare, which he said has slowed down the pace of development and cost-sharing. His White House has been largely silent on the healthcare issue in recent weeks, but the president's Twitter account has been frequently at odds with the country's healthcare system. Trump fired off a string of tweets on Sunday morning, including one that said he was not going to allow Americans to use their Medicare Advantage plans. It's unclear which House Democrat he's referring to if the president doesn't recognize the repeal of Obamacare. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement to CNN that the administration's' disastrous' healthcare law is why House Democrats will try to block Obamacare repeal next year. The Senate is expected to vote this week on a proposal by Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Alexander was one of the bill's chief architects, and the bill's passage is expected in early December."

The staffer, who is not being named because he is the victim of privacy laws, was exposed to the virus before going overseas for a 10-day trip in late October. The source said the House staffer sent a ""clean bill of health"" to the Department of Health and Human Services on Oct. 12, and has since returned to work. No other House staff members or others have been exposed to the virus since, and the House will ""continue to thoroughly vet all House staffs"" in accordance with existing procedures, the source said. The source said the unidentified staffer returned to work last week after the House staff traveled and called the CDC, which determined the circumstances with which the staffer returned to the Capitol. The source said the staffer, who is from West Springfield, Mass., was ""very, very sick"" and has since developed a ""fever, headache, runny nose and cough."" Fox News first reported the news. The House source said the employee has not been seen by his doctor. The health care worker is ""in good condition and on the road to recovery,"" the House source said.

Photograph: Daniel Acker / AP Joe Biden's campaign was on Monday night forced to deny a memo from a strategist who has been at the forefront of the Democratic campaign against Bernie Sanders. The memo, from David Axelrod, was obtained by Politico. In a statement, said the campaign ""does not have any comment"" on the memo. ""It's almost impossible for either man to make up the difference in the delegate count or the delegate award,"" said Rich Beeson, Biden's top adviser. Axelrod was quoted in a Friday memo, which is still being debated by Clinton campaign staffers. The memo refers to a provision of the Ohio law that requires voters to present identification to show they have signed up for an absentee ballot in the primary election. The Clinton campaign pointed to the law in a statement that said those who do not have ballots will not be able to cast votes. In the memo, Axelrod said he understood why the Clinton campaign's decision would be questioned. ""My view is that that's a real mistake,"" he wrote. Those ballots are the ones that [Clinton] can't count in Ohio, and every other state in the country, because that's where we made the mistake. A Clinton campaign official said in a statement that the memo was ""inaccurate and misleading."" The Clinton campaign has said that it does not have any evidence that the Ohio law is unconstitutional, as the state is one of the first states in the country where the ballot, which is not included in the primary, must be filled out. Axelrod has been a top aide to presidential candidate John Kerry and his presidential campaign in 2004. He has worked for the Clinton campaign in Iowa, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada and elsewhere. Clinton has said she does not want to have a Clinton White House and that she plans to be the nominee in the general election. She must win her remaining primary contests to avoid a defeat by Sanders to deny her a majority of delegates in the Democratic nominating process."
534,"Community turns out to honor decorated Mass. WWII vet who died without family SANTA ANA, Calif. -- A community in Southern California on Wednesday was reeling Monday on the day Glen McQueen died without his family by his bedside at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. McQueen was a decorated war veteran when he survived an amphibious landing in the Philippine Sea in 1944. The community of Santa Rosa was among the first to gather for a memorial on the Fourth of July, honoring McQueen, who was killed while on a mission to rescue Vietnamese refugees from Laos in 1967. The hospital where McQueen was treated described him as a ""true American hero."" McQueen's son, Rich, called the decision to honor his father ""a tragedy for all of us."" ""I'm just so grateful for this opportunity to honor my father,"" Rich McQueen told reporters. And I'm going to wait until I get a chance to sit down with him, not just for us but for all of us in Santa Rosa. Veterans of the Santa Rosa community joined police and relatives of McQueen at a vigil at the hospital where the former Marine, an honorary Navy captain, died. The hospital is a veterans' hospital that helps veterans. The family of McQueen was among those attending the vigil. Santa Rosa Police Chief Timothy Brown said a family member told him the hospital's last visit before the service had been without McQueen. But the family was not planning on getting his body reburied at the hospital on the Fourth of July. ""The family is very anxious,"" Brown said. They're very concerned about what's going to happen to this body. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said in a statement that McQueen was ""a great American hero, a worthy recipient of our nation's highest honor, the Medal of Honor."" In addition to the memorial, the hospital has created a special memorial in his honor. ""He was one of the finest people I met in my career and I will miss him terribly,"" Schwarzenegger said in the statement.

535,"Local kindergarten teacher donates kidney to mom of former student A Florida kindergarten teacher is donating her kidney to her former student, who is recovering after losing her upper kidney to leukemia. Danielle Jones, 43, worked with the mother of 17-year-old Zachary Arrington, who was diagnosed with leukemia at age 14. Jones is one of a handful of kindergartners taking part in the event in Pembroke Pines. When they learned Arrington's condition was terminal, they visited the school to get their classmates' thoughts on going through this difficult time.'In the beginning, we didn't have any clue, 'the teacher told WTSP. All of a sudden, I was ready to help her. At the hospital, they were able to send their kidneys to Arrington's body for transplant. Her kidney was donated to save the life of her son. When she came out, she said she was' thrilled 'that she knew Arrington's story.'I feel so blessed to have him,' she added. Arrington had been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia when he was 12. His mother, who was diagnosed with leukemia in 2014, donated her kidney to keep her son alive. But doctors told Arrington that her kidney function was failing. Arrington decided to donate her kidney, which is still in the system, because he had a family history of the disease. She said she had never seen a kidney donation like it in all her years of teaching. She said she would have to find a new one to go with that. Doctors say Arrington has only one more year to live. It is unclear when she will be able to receive a kidney or if she will need a transplant. Arrington is now in the intensive care unit with her daughter, Marcy.'Her kidney was a natural thing, 'Jones told the station. I was happy that she was able to donate it. I am not sure when my kidney will be able to get put in there. I just know it's going to take some time.' Arrington's condition is not related to her blood cancer. She is in good spirits and is hopeful. The Pembroke Pines school district has set up a GoFundMe page to help raise money for her medical bills. They are asking for donations to $5,149."
536,"Farmington biotech teams with Yale to pursue COVID-19 vaccine CHICAGO (Reuters) - Farmington Biotechnology Co said on Monday it has teamed up with Yale University to commercialize the vaccine for COVID-19 - a genetic disorder that affects more than 1 million Americans - for use in the treatment of adult-onset diabetes. The company said it plans to begin marketing the vaccine shortly. COVID-19 affects the lungs and has no cure, and symptoms include wheezing, difficulty breathing and difficulty swallowing, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disease, which affects the lungs and can be prevented with lifestyle changes, is rarely fatal. The company said in a statement that the vaccine, which it had licensed from Yale, is being developed for the study of children and adults. Yale said it is also collaborating with the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania to develop a gene therapy that could be delivered to the child. Farmington had licensed the vaccine from Genzyme Corporation for use in a study to treat the disease, which has a 50 percent mortality rate. The company has been working with researchers on a special group of children with COVID-19 to find a therapy for the disorder that might be a viable treatment option for adults.

537,"Third missing boaterâ <unk> <unk> s body recovered from Tennessee River NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A body found in the Tennessee River a week ago about a mile from where a boater went missing has been recovered, a sheriff said Wednesday. The body of Joseph E. Reyes, 27, was recovered Wednesday afternoon and investigators believe he fell into the river, said Tennessee State Police Sgt. Russ Knocke. The body was recovered from the North Carolina river, Knocke said. The body of John Thomas Davis, 24, was found about a mile from where Davis disappeared after going missing in April. The river, which flows through Tennessee and is a popular recreation spot for boaters, is about a mile from where Reyes went missing. Knocke said Davis was not wearing a life jacket. Davis was last seen April 8 after he left an Appalachian bar with a friend, and the friend has claimed that he was robbed at gunpoint. Reyes, who also was known as ""Slay,"" had gone to the Appalachian barbershop with a male friend. Police are looking for Kenneth A. Doss, 34, who was last seen Friday and police say he may be armed with a gun. The bodies of two other missing boaters in the same area have also been recovered. Authorities are searching for a third person, also believed to be Davis, who was last seen on April 8. Anyone who sees Davis or the men in the Appalachian River or river should call the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency at (713) 845-2777. Check back for updates on this developing story. Video of a car crash in the middle of the night of April 8 shows a woman being run over by a car. The woman died at a local hospital a week later. Her car was found about six miles from where Johnson's body was located. The crash is under investigation, the sheriff said. Investigators are waiting for fingerprints to confirm the car was the vehicle that was involved in the crash that left the woman critically injured. The car's license plate is still on the vehicle's dashboard, but Knocke told reporters Wednesday that the crash may have been caused by the car's rearview mirror. Johnson, who had just moved to Nashville from Illinois, left his family behind to return to the Carolinas. The last confirmed sighting of Johnson was April 12, according to a Facebook post."

This is not the first time a police officer has been caught on camera beating a suspect. In 2014, it was revealed that a white police officer punched a black man in the back of the head. This is yet another disturbing case. And this is the latest in a string of controversies for our police. Brian Ross, thank you.

541,"Local animal shelter offers unique adoption program for terminally ill pets - RT Viral Published time: 22 Mar, 2017 17: 06 Dogs and other animals in need of temporary care can now be rehomed with the help of the local shelter, where they can have a loving home with their foster family or with a foster family. The San Francisco based shelter, Adopt-a-Doggy, has teamed up with the Humane Society of the United States to offer a unique adoption program in the Bay Area. The program offers an unconditional adoption for any adopted pets at San Francisco Animal Shelter, or just one pup, for every year of life. ""Our goal is to have dogs and other animals here for years to come,"" Ren Ping, an assistant director, said. In the meantime, we don't want anybody to have to choose between us and our shelter. Dogs and other animals in need of temporary care can now enjoy a loving home and have their own foster family after a decision is made in the adopter's favor. ""This program allows dogs and other pets to become foster family and have their family and be together with a loving loving owner,"" said Ping. We're not looking for a substitute for a foster family. We just want the dog that loves and trusts, and the family that loves and cares for the dog. We know the foster family is the best place to adopt and we will work to ensure that this can happen. The shelter launched the adoption program in response to the popularity of dog adoptions in California, where the number has been on the rise. Opposing groups like the Humane Society of the United States have sued over the adoption program, saying it will make it easier for adoptive families to adopt their pets. ""It's an innovative way to provide good homes for animals who are suffering,"" said Ping. The adoption process is not one-size-fits-all for each case. If a foster family doesn't give a dog and a foster family cares for their foster child, adoption is not the same as adopting. San Francisco Animal Shelter is one of the largest permanent rescue shelters in the United States, with over 35,000 animals and pets receiving foster care in 2016. The organization is also the largest city animal shelters in North America."

543,"After Fraudsters Racked Up $6,000 On Stolen Credit Card, HSBC Demanded Victim Pay Up, Despite â <unk> <unk> Zero Liabilityâ <unk> <unk> Promise Some Customers' Fears of Fraud HSBC's fraud detection program is now operating in New York City but not on the West Coast, and other customers say it leaves them vulnerable to identity theft. A slick online service based in London, Belgium, has reported a surge in fraudulent activity in New York City. The scam involves fraudulent credit card transactions, in which fraudsters are given a credit card number to transfer to someone else's account, giving them access to a person's personal bank account. The con artists then make payments to the card, which can be used to purchase goods, including jewelry, electronics and cash. The scammers are then able to lure customers to their online accounts, sending the victim money. The fraudsters then go on to steal the victim's money as well. That's when they are called to use the fraudulent credit card number, the report states. ""This is life-changing for most people,"" said Mark Serwotka, acting chief technology officer at HSBC. It's a really serious problem for our customers and we take this very seriously. Fraud is a huge problem in our industry. The problem of scammers and their perpetrators is growing. We are seeing a significant spike in fraud, and we're working hard to protect our customers. The fraud report says over $6 billion is lost to identity theft every year. ""We cannot believe this is happening at all without a strong anti-fraud response in the community,"" said Serwotka. The issue is now being fixed and HSBC is encouraging customers to get in touch with their bank, if they notice suspicious activity, to report it. Fraud has become increasingly difficult to detect in the United States. A recent report from the nonprofit Common Sense Media found that more than half of all reported identity theft cases occur in the U.S. In New York City, the rate is about 17 percent, according to the report. It's a pattern that continues to be noticed. The majority of New Yorkers are not reporting the fraud, but it is not uncommon to report it, ""said David McClelland, director of Common Sense Media. We have a strategy to stop it."

He told the court that while he considered himself ""a very good father,"" he loved his daughter and wanted to create a good life for her. He had been warned that if he ever did harm her, he would be put in jail. However, Hendren claimed that his mother told him that he had no idea she had a gun, and that he had no idea that she had a loaded gun.

549,"This Parkville girl knows the lasting effects of a pandemic after getting H1N1 more than a decade ago and taking medication to stop her respiratory tract infection. ""It was a totally different disease,"" said 16-year-old Chloe Miller of Parkville, who was diagnosed in 2012. I think it was the flu and it almost killed me. It killed me. I didn't really care. Miller got the flu the last time she was sick and was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital for treatment. But she stopped. ""I would say I was sick again,"" she said. Life went on. I got sick. The virus was unpredictable. That's what I tried to get away from and that's why I'm back. Chloe and her father survived. The disease, which spreads from person-to-person, usually strikes very infectious people, and can lead to severe complications, both in the hospital and on the other patients in the hospital room. The immune system is strong and fights infection, so it's difficult to eradicate infection when it's spread from person to person. The disease can cause death in as many as a 50 percent of cases. The disease usually strikes, but the hospital, in its efforts to protect the patients, has been trying to find ways to ward off it for a while. After Chloe's initial hospitalization, doctors at St Vincent's could not be sure that she was virus-free. But they did eventually learn that she did not have the virus. Doctors even tried to treat her with antibiotics. Doctors took blood and sent her to the National Institutes of Health to be tested in early 2012. Chloe was diagnosed with the flu again in September, 2012, and she had a second bout in June of that year. ""It was bad enough that I was so sick, but I didn't really think about it,"" she said. ""I said,"" I'm making it through it. """" As she sat in the hospital bed, she had a lot of energy, and was excited about getting back in the classroom after school. ""I got to go to a lot of physical exams, because that's when I really had to reassess,"" she said. But, I really wanted to get back into school. She has a short-term memory problem, but it has been improving, as her teachers monitor her progress. ""I'm still getting better,"" Chloe said."

551,"Judge overturns Utah death row inmate Von Lester Taylor's double murder conviction An inmate at Utah's death row has been overturned after a judge ruled a second jury couldn't reach a unanimous verdict against him. Von Lester Taylor received a life sentence in the 1994 shooting death in his home in Provo. A second jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict against him. It is not clear when the next court hearing will take place. The trial comes four years after Taylor was found guilty of killing a neighbour and her two daughters. The case exposed injustices in the US capital, including a controversial death penalty system that led to a 2013 ruling by the US Supreme Court. The Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit decided that a previously untested double murder conviction could be used as a basis for ending a life sentence. A written decision says that an ""aggravating circumstance"" did not justify a new trial or finding new evidence. The five-member jury that was instructed to consider the case was also unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The court also said that if further evidence had emerged that was relevant to the trial, then ""the trial court should consider the evidence without prejudice."" If the double murder conviction is upheld, Taylor will be put to death. Taylor was convicted in 1994 for the killing of his neighbour, Raymond Bustos, 48, and his two daughters. ""We've lost so many things,"" said his lawyer, Benjamin Crump. This case isn't over. It won't be over until the last reset is made, but this case has been worth it. According to the Utah attorney general, the court had put the trial on hold this time because the judge's finding that the two victims were the true killers had not been made clear in court. A third inmate, Raymond Robert Joseph, was convicted and sentenced to death in November. The victim's killer is scheduled to be executed in January. The Utah Department of Corrections said it would appeal the court's decision. The department's Deputy Coroner for the Utah Department of Corrections, Chad Conrad, said he would ""consult"" with the Utah Justice Department after the next court hearing. His department has not made any public comment. Salt Lake City Post, agencies, Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report. Copyright: USA Today.

552,"Video shows mountain lion attacking deputy in Larimer County A deputy was attacked by an alligator on Saturday after the animal charged at him and tried to attack him. The deputy was able to grab the gator with his bare hands and pull it away from the animal, which is still alive. The man was not injured in the incident. The video shows the deer running around as the deputy is about to fire his gun. The deputy manages to get some air on the animal. The alligator then tries to bite the deputy, forcing him to come down. The deputy's face is covered by a rag. The county fire department said that the deputy was transported to a hospital to treat a cut on his hand. No other information was available about the incident, but a statement from the sheriff's office said the deputy was at a residence when he was attacked. The man was not injured in the incident. The wildlife commission said it is recommending that people keep their dogs on a lead, although it urged people to not leave any unattended pets in the house. The department said that in 2017, three people were shot and killed by alligators in the Lake County area. Most of the incidents were in the Lake County area. The last person seriously wounded in the incident was a 32-year-old man and his wife who were killed by alligators in August. The couple had been visiting the Lake County community of Odessa at the time to see what it was like to see wildlife, but had not planned any upcoming stops, the sheriff's office said. They were returning from a morning stroll when they were attacked. A man and his wife were killed by alligators in Odessa on 1 / 3 January. The husband and his wife, a 53-year-old woman, were attacked while visiting a lake on the Upper Lake and Odessa Reservoir at about 6am. The wife, who was pronounced dead at the scene, had been shot by the same animals that roamed the area around the lake. The man and the woman had stopped at the lake to pet a fox. The man, who was uninjured, later told authorities that he had been shot in the head by the same animals. A family member found the husband dead on the lake with a gunshot wound to the head. His wife, a 38-year-old woman, was shot and killed at 4am on Monday by a male animal."
553,"Private event industry hit hard in midst of ban on large gatherings in Oregon A conference scheduled in the Oregon city of Eugene this week has been canceled amid the fallout of a state ban on large gatherings, which was approved by the Legislature. The decision by the Eugene City Council follows similar changes at other public gatherings across the nation, including the U.S. Constitution and the Supreme Court. The decision to cancel the event comes after the Southern Poverty Law Center voiced outrage at a rally scheduled Friday night by conservative white nationalists in Portland. The group claims the rally was intended to draw attention to tax rates and other issues at the organization's fundraising events. According to the organization, several hundred people attended the event, with at least 50 people arrested. ""We have a right to express our opinions, but we don't want them to be used against us,"" said Bob Davis, the president of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Davis said that he's proud of the organization's work against tax rates and other issues. There was a large turnout. This is the biggest audience we've had at a poker event in the state, ""he said. We're glad that we're involved with these organizations because we're trying to organize something that we can do. The organizers said they're still trying to figure out how to go forward with the event. Reactions to the event on social media ranged from outrage to support."" It is amazing to see how the city can rally to such a small crowd, ""tweeted @ joynethesouthwayz. It's truly sad that someone would resort to this. This behavior is wrong, and it needs to be stopped. I support the # Oregonian # Poverty movement. A private event organized by Eugene City Council was to take place Thursday at the council's office."" The Eugene City Council can only stand together and take action against bigotry, racism and discrimination, ""said council chairman Bill McAteer. He said his organization will try to find out if the city will have a license for the event or if it will be canceled. The City Council previously approved a similar event in San Francisco on Tuesday. That event had been canceled after the council determined it would be illegal under state law to hold a conference on race. When asked if organizers would consider relocating to a smaller space, McAteer said,"" That's up for discussion."

Last week at least two people were injured after their car rolled over and caught fire and burst into flames. Two men were trapped in the car, and authorities say the other two were able to escape from the burning vehicle and walked away from the fire. Firefighters have managed to cut the roof off the vehicle, and firefighters hope to bring the blaze under control once the flames have been extinguished. The car reportedly rolled over a year ago at the intersection of Pacific Coast Highway and Manteca Boulevard, causing extensive damage to the vehicle. It was not reported whether the two men were wearing seatbelts at the time. The crash comes as Manteca, Calif., has a history of deadly accidents, including two last year when a man in his early 50s was killed after his car crossed the median and the front of a firetruck caught fire. At least one vehicle was also involved in a crash in the Sierra Nevada Mountains on September 28. Investigators believe that alcohol may have played a role causing the accident. The California Highway Patrol's traffic crash unit has filed a report that it will consider whether alcohol played a role. CBS News' Alan He contributed to this report.

The practice attracts students and people from the local area and is said to have a large following on social media. It is hoped that the masks will be used in the country's national festivals, to be held next month, and make people aware of the dangers of posing as a police officer. Mrs Mani, who calls herself a ""goddess,"" started the business in the park as a way to teach business skills. She said: ""I was interested in helping the local police with their work. I wanted to help with the promotion of the local culture. I wanted to teach the locals about the dangers of posing as a police officer. I had a chance to teach the people. They saw my picture because I am a goddess, and it triggered a lot of attention. Before I started this business I had an idea that it would be a fun way to spread the message. I want to teach the local people about this danger of posing as a police officer. People have been taking photographs, asking for police ID and asking for the masks. The project was started by Mrs Mani and her husband, who said that they wanted to make the masks permanent. The first two masks with the masks were sold out within a few days. The businesswoman, who has not been named, said that she hopes to eventually introduce the rest to the country and to make the masks permanent. When asked about the idea of the mask, she said:"" I want to show the whole world that the police is not a myth. I was inspired by the idea of a goddess. I want to make more people learn about the danger of posing as a policeman. I want to make them aware of the dangers of posing as a police officer. I am going to go on doing the masks. I hope to bring them to different parts of the world. I want to make them aware that the police is not a myth. I want to make them aware that they are not a police officer. I want them to remember that they are not a police officer. The mask is available on the website of the Hindustan Times. All photographs taken by Zeynep Sinha"

559,"Red Cross calls on healthy donors as coronavirus concerns cancel blood drives in Jordan AMMAN, Jordan -- In Jordan, the Red Cross is calling on its donor base to give blood for the first time since the deadly virus began to cause a shortage of blood. The U.S. National Library of Medicine describes the virus as a ""severe emergency"" that can spill and cause dangerous complications, but in recent days has reported some of the worst outbreaks of the disease in recent years. No major cases have been reported in Jordan. Red Cross spokesman James O. O'Connell said Monday's call to donors is ""just the beginning."" He said donations must be carried through Monday at 12 noon. The World Health Organization says it's running low on blood for ""most people,"" particularly young children. O'Connell said donors have been urged to donate blood and the Red Cross is trying to get over the initial shock. Doctors said donors can donate blood and have had success using the World Health Organization's blood donor database. The virus is spread via direct contact with the bodily fluids of infected patients. In Jordan, the only country where cases are common, more than 1,600 people have donated, O'Connell said. The World Health Organization has set up a hotline for people affected by the virus to contact their local Red Cross office. It is contacting the country's hospitals, the Red Cross and other public health organizations across the Middle East as well as the United States. The number of blood donations is growing rapidly, and O'Connell said the organization is trying to coordinate donors with the World Health Organization in order to get them onto the center's digital donation system. ""We are very hopeful that we can get donors on the ground as soon as possible,"" he said. We know that people are feeling the effects. At least 150 people have died in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Syria since the virus's first death in March. Saudi Arabia has seen more than 300 confirmed cases, including 10 in the capital, Riyadh, according to the World Health Organization. In addition to Jordan, other nations affected by the virus include Ivory Coast, Burundi, Liberia and Sierra Leone. More than 2,500 people have died worldwide from the virus. On Friday, the WHO announced that it is shutting down blood drives in the region because of the virus. Nearly 123,000 people are in Jordan."

561,"NBA's Coronavirus Hiatus Could Mean Chaos for League's Economic Structure League in San Antonio, there was speculation that a full-fledged lockout could ensue by the start of March, with no sign of a resolution. It wouldn't be surprising, considering how many players said they were planning to play this season. ""These guys are just going to have to deal with it,"" said guard Jason Terry, who had 21 points and 10 rebounds. This is not going to help us. You can't have a lockout that affects everybody. The NBA declined to comment on the situation when asked if it would be affected, but the league would appear to be in a better position to handle the potential impact if the lockout was terminated as planned by March 31. The league has already been given permission to begin the season by the NBA Players Assn., which has been negotiating new labor terms with the league. The NBA is scheduled to begin its free-agent signing period on March 4. The owners of the San Antonio Spurs have a 72 percent share of the league's votes, so it's possible that a lockout could mean a lockout, with a majority of players likely to opt out. The NBA has had a rocky start to the season in San Antonio, where it has lost its last eight games. On Sunday, San Antonio's Tim Duncan and West Virginia's Nate Robinson were ejected after a fight during a timeout. The Spurs went on to beat the Warriors 105-102, but Duncan and Robinson were both ejected. The Clippers, who recently re-signed Blake Griffin, had been scheduled to visit the Spurs on Sunday and meet with owner Steve Ballmer, but the team announced on Sunday that Griffin had chosen to stay at home because he was ""resting."" The Clippers have asked Ballmer to explain the decision to Griffin and the Clippers for clarification on how to proceed. The Clippers played the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday night and were scheduled to return to Los Angeles on Monday. They will be in New York to play the Lakers on Friday and then face the New York Knicks on Monday. The Clippers also play the San Antonio Spurs on Monday before returning to Dallas on Tuesday, but it remains unclear when the Clippers will have to play on a Friday night in the NBA. The Clippers could play the Dallas Mavericks on Monday night. The Clippers are scheduled to visit the Spurs on Wednesday."

The tournament will be held next week at Augusta. The Augusta National Golf Club said in a news release that the tournament will be played March 11-15, the same day as the U.S. Open. Augusta National officials received about 40 reports of coronavirus infections on Friday. The tournament will have a new sponsor soon. The announcement comes after the R & A announced it had postponed the Australian Open and U.S. Open as well as the British Open and U.S. Amateur. The U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur are on the schedule. Coronaviruses cause severe gastroenteritis, which can lead to illness in young children, the elderly and the very young. The illness is treated by antibiotics. Each year, the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. increases. As of June 30, there were 726 confirmed cases of the illness, representing a 23 percent increase from the previous year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There have been 11 confirmed cases in 2015, the majority of which have occurred in Arizona, California, Florida and Texas. More than 80 percent of cases are hospitalizations. The virus can be transmitted by eating contaminated food and touching contaminated surfaces or objects. It is not contagious in humans. In a statement, the Augusta National Golf Club said it was working with the World Health Organization and other organizations, including health authorities, to make sure the tournament schedule is safe and the health of the participants and the tournament. ""We are taking this precautionary measure to ensure health and safety for all who compete on our green and charitable courses,"" the statement said. There is no reason to change the schedule. The tournament has already attracted big names like Tiger Woods. The first day of the Masters featured the first nine holes played Sunday, with the tournament being played on the Augusta National Golf Club's South Course. The second and third days were played the following week. A possible cluster of cases are also developing. The Augusta National Golf Club says it is cooperating fully with government and health officials. ""We encourage anyone with any concerns about their health to seek medical attention as soon as possible,"" the statement said. The Augusta course will not be affected by the affected golf course."
563,"Players React to NCAA Canceling March Madness Amid Coronavirus Concerns The NCAA has canceled the March Madness games scheduled for Thursday and Friday night. The college basketball tournament is the last major tournament of the college basketball season and the NCAA has made no changes to its current rules for determining the games that will be played. The NCAA had offered advice on how the games should be played before canceling the tournament, but the NCAA changed the rule to allow that guidance. ""We have made no changes to the March Madness tournament's conditions in light of the public health concerns in the wake of an outbreak of a highly contagious virus and fear of becoming the first to be diagnosed with the flu,"" the NCAA said in a news release. We are working closely with the CDC, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the states with the highest percentage of college basketball teams to ensure the safety of our players, coaches, staff and fans. We will be actively participating in this week's CBSSports.com National Basketball Tournament, which will include a game between Kentucky and UConn. If you have a question about the game, please contact our NCAA tournament officials via telephone at (202) 698-5632. The tournament will be played March 1-7 at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana. ESPN and WNEM are both supporting the NCAA's decision, and they are also sharing updates on Twitter. The NCAA is offering refunds for fans who bought tickets. Before the news of the canceled tournament was announced, the NCAA said it was conducting a ""comprehensive review"" of the case. The NCAA said it did not know if a new case of swine flu had been reported in Indiana, nor whether there has been a total outbreak of the H1N1 virus in the state. A similar outbreak in Mexico in April led to the suspension of a March Madness game between UConn and Kansas. It's possible both the virus and the game could have spread to people in the United States. The case of a March Madness game is still under review. The NCAA said all events scheduled for Saturday will be postponed. The NCAA said: ""The NCAA has not changed its March Madness game date at Lucas Oil Stadium. Winners will be notified later today."

No matter how many championship games it generated, the Big Dance never drew in the big-name, high-intensity crowd. ""That's the way it's supposed to be,"" Sister Jean-Marie said. We don't want to be remembered as a football team, but we want to be remembered as an athletic program. How many teams have that? We don't want to be remembered as a football program. A little over a year ago, the Big Dance celebrated its 150th anniversary with a grueling run to Big Ten championships in the final two months of the season. Now, with a bitter fight looming over whether the NCAA will cancel the title, the Big Dance has been cast as a distraction on the court. ""It's the wrong call,"" said Jerry Colangelo, the Big Dance's athletic director. We want to be remembered as a pro football program. The national title game is scheduled for Sept. 11 at New York Fashion Week. The Big Dance has served as a distraction to fans, even if it has led to a trip to the hospital to see a doctor. ""We're worried about him,"" said Pat Murphy, the Big Dance's vice president of athletics. We're worried about his family. We can't watch the Big Dance. How the Big Dance will fare in the next year, when the NCAA will decide whether to reinstate the tournament, remains to be seen. The NCAA had suspended the Big Dance in January after a man connected to the program was accused of raping a player in a hotel bedroom and sexually assaulting her. The man, Jock Johnson, was charged with rape and false imprisonment, but the case was dismissed, so the Big Dance has not announced whether it will reinstate the tournament. ""We're a private university, but we have always been known as a sports institution,"" Murphy said. We have been here for a long time. We don't want to get distracted from that. We're here to be a part of the Big Dance. This is our mission. The Big Dance can take its place as a sports institution. And that's where the NCAA should be."

The MLB Players Association and players association's health department had been sharing the news and were working with the league to ensure game times were kept the same.

But it's very, very concerning. They're going to have to play. Players are also concerned about the health of the other players, who are staying home. Alderson said at a news conference Saturday that there is ""no fear of infection or illness"" among the players and had some advice for them.

Why does this outbreak affect sports medicine? Zika infections are rare, but they can cause severe consequences for athletes and other health care workers. Symptoms can include fever, rash, joint pain, headache, joint and muscle pain. How does Zika affect athletes? CMCC can occur in a wide range of conditions, including malaria, dengue fever and Zika virus. The virus is most commonly transmitted through bites of infected blood-sucking mosquitoes, but is also transmitted via sexual contact and insect bites. Has any treatment been developed to treat CMCC? The disease is also found in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America. The World Health Organization has said that the Zika virus poses no threat to human health or other people, and that it is not considered a public health emergency because it can only be transmitted by mosquitoes. A person infected with Zika virus without symptoms is not considered to be at risk of contracting the infection. The virus also poses no risk to those who are not infected with the virus, and so can be transmitted to others. The virus is more widespread in the more tropical regions of the world, particularly in Southeast Asia, Africa and South America. The first outbreak of the Zika virus in the region of the Pacific Ocean was reported in 2016, and since 2015 the outbreak has spread to the U.S., Mexico, Canada, Mexico, Canada, Costa Rica and Costa Rica. There have been 223 confirmed cases of Zika in the U.S."
567,"Trump declares a national emergency to combat coronavirus. The National Epidemiology Program lists as a suspected cause of the virus. Washington On August 10, 2017, an emergency declaration was issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in order to prevent the spread of the virus and its impact on public health. The declaration was made the same day that authorities in Washington, D.C., announced that the H1N1 vaccine was no longer permitted to be used for medical purposes. On August 1, 2017, the CDC issued a statement on its website saying the last vaccinations for this season had been for H1N1, which is the most common strain of flu in the world. So far, there have been 19 confirmed cases of the virus. In their statement, the CDC said that it was notified of the sudden death of a child who died last Friday from the H1N1 virus. The statement said that the child's death was ""not unexpected"" given that, ""the CDC did not immediately receive this information."" The CDC said that the child's death was a ""result of the vaccination of children for the H1N1 flu strain."" The agency said that it was working with health departments to identify the child and release him to the care of his family. In a statement, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said that ""while the death of one healthy child in Mexico is very rare, the situation in the United States is comparable to other flu outbreaks in Mexico and is under control."" The World Health Organization said that it was ""aware of the situation"" in Mexico and said that ""the United States is in close contact"" with Mexico and that ""the World Health Organization remains fully concerned about the situation there."" In a statement, PAHO said that the Pan American Health Organization, in coordination with health departments around the world, identified the child's family. ""The PAHO is providing the family with appropriate support as appropriate,"" it added. The WHO confirmed that a person was confirmed to have the virus in Mexico after arriving in Mexico in mid-August. Following the confirmation, the H1N1 flu virus was declared ""pandemic"" by the World Health Organization. The disease continues to spread throughout Latin America, with 13 fatalities reported there so far this year. To learn more about the virus, visit the National Epidemi"
568,"US summons Chinese ambassador over coronavirus conspiracy theory The United States summoned the Chinese ambassador to Washington on Saturday for meeting over allegations that a Chinese scientist was involved in a conspiracy to infect American hospital patients with a coronavirus, a US official said. A State Department official told AFP that China had summoned the US ambassador to Washington, Mark Lippert, ""for a phone conversation."" Lippert, who is also the US trade representative, told Lippert that it was ""unfortunate that this incident has caused alarm within the community,"" the official said. The official added that Lippert ""has told the ambassador that he will continue to call on China to cooperate with the US, and to take action in response to this incident."" The official called Lippert's actions ""uninformed and misguided"" and that China would take appropriate action based on that. The US government has confirmed that the source of the coronavirus is a Chinese scientist, who was not identified, but has no other confirmed link to the virus. The official said the US was ready to work with China to eliminate the risk of widespread healthcare-associated infections. The WHO confirmed on Friday that eight people have contracted the disease in the US, including four pediatric patients who have since recovered. Two people have died - a British national and a Canadian. The US Food and Drug Administration has also confirmed six cases of severe gastrointestinal illness. Two of the six are children. The World Health Organisation has so far closed six of its countries' 22-member pandemic monitoring team due to the outbreak, citing a lack of adequate technology and coordination. The UK has confirmed 19 cases of potential infections, including a patient who had been in contact with an infected former patient. Lippert met with China's ambassador to Washington, Wu Dawei, on Saturday to discuss the case, the US official said. ""The Chinese side has expressed its great remorse over the incident,"" he said. The US government has no plans to close the US Embassy until the investigation is concluded. The US delegation was due to leave China on Saturday. An earlier Chinese government statement said China had no knowledge of the alleged conspiracy. The US has also urged China to end an investigation into the source of the coronavirus. US officials said Saturday that they had traced the source to a Chinese province with the same strain and has ordered that all US personnel"

Republicans have proposed eliminating the aid funding, which would have effectively stopped the effort to treat the highly contagious disease. Pelosi said she expected the House to vote on the House's measure ""pretty quickly."" The House voted overwhelmingly on Republican health care legislation last week that would ban funding for the Affordable Care Act for people who became ill with the virus.

571,"US conducts airstrikes against multiple Iranian-backed militia sites in Iraq The United States has carried out airstrikes against a number of Iranian-backed militia targets in Iraq, the Pentagon said on Wednesday, continuing a surge of attacks against the militant group earlier this month. Navy Captain Jeff Davis, a spokesman for Operation Inherent Resolve, said the US military conducted 10 airstrikes in Iraq on Wednesday, including one targeting a command center in Diyala province. He declined to provide details of the strike. The US also struck a compound that houses Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen in Hayaniyah, south of Baghdad, Davis said. The exact location of the base was not immediately known. Davis said the strikes were conducted in response to intelligence reports that Iran was planning a retaliatory strike against the Iraqi government. The strikes were conducted in Iraq's western Anbar province, Davis said. The strikes were against targets in Fallujah, Ramadi, Mosul and other areas, he added. The US-led coalition has been carrying out nearly 140 airstrikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), another militant group, since August. The US says the group has lost nearly all its territory in Iraq and Syria as a result of the fighting. The Pentagon has said that Iraqi forces have retaken much of the territory the group once controlled, and that Iraqi forces had advanced further into the western Anbar province.

572,"Louisiana will delay presidential primary due to coronavirus outbreak JACKSONVILLE, La. -- Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal says his state will delay its presidential primary election scheduled for Feb. 12 due to the state's latest outbreak of a coronavirus strain. Jindal said Monday that the state will not hold an election in the most populous U.S. state while it investigates the cause of the outbreak. The disease has not yet been confirmed in Louisiana. Jindal was asked by reporters whether the state will hold its primary. He said the outbreak remains under investigation. The state health department previously announced that a woman in Louisiana became ill with the bacterial disease. The woman died. The CDC is investigating the source. Jindal's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A poll released last week by the University of New Orleans' Center for Public Health and the Louisiana Public Service Commission showed Jindal with a slight edge over his state rival, Republican Rick Perry. Jindal won the Republican primary for governor in 2010. The poll was conducted Thursday through Sunday and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. A full list of candidates and candidates can be found here. The CDC has not yet revealed whether Jindal will appear in the next debate on Fox News. He has vowed to tackle climate change, which will be viewed as an issue in his closing argument before the state's Republican convention in February. A state-wide outbreak of an influenza-like illness has sickened 21 people since last month. The virus can cause complications including pneumonia, kidney failure, deafness and death. This year's outbreak also has been linked to a botulism outbreak that was linked to a sushi restaurant in New York City. More than two dozen people have recently been sickened in the state: The most recent cases were in 2008. Louisiana has more than 800,000 people and the outbreak has been the largest in the nation in recent years. CNN's Ralph Ellis, Nicole Chavez and Chuck Johnston contributed to this report. A doctor who treated a Louisiana child suffering from polio says she never saw any signs that the respiratory disease was in the child's system. The girl, who died from fungal meningitis, had previously never been given a vaccine, doctors said. CNN's David Williams and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.

573,"With coronavirus closing schools, here's how you can help food insecure children The world is in the grip of an outbreak of a deadly coronavirus, which has killed at least 151 people in the Philippines and infected more than 100,000. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has sent teams to help schools and nurseries run basic hygiene and food safety. Here's how to help: Get your kids to school in a safe and hygienic way, but don't expect to see a lot of those children. If they don't have a school, it's too late to provide them with food. If they don't have a school, they don't need it. If the children require it, they'll be able to get it, but they'll need to use emergency supply, so they won't be able to get it if they don't have the food. Some people may be unable to get it and they won't be able to get it. There's a reason that coronaviruses are so infectious, so why are they spreading so rapidly? The answer is that they aren't always circulating on a consistent basis. And the reason is that they evolve, and change, depending on the number of cases. That means if you've got a lot of patients and nurseries that don't have the right safety protocols, you're not going to have as many cases as you would like. If you have a lot of people using emergency supplies, like water, and you can't get your children to school, then you're not going to have as many cases as you would like. But if a lot of people are going to use food that's not safe, you're not going to have as many cases as you would like. If you have a lot of people in your community that are going to be using [food] that's not safe, you're not going to have as many cases as you would like. Then you're not going to have as many cases as you'd like. The CDC has warned that the disease could spread quickly because of the amount of water in the environment. It recommends that people wash their hands frequently, cook food thoroughly and cook food for up to two days at a time. The CDC has said that it has issued an alert to local hospitals because of the outbreak. You can also help by getting in contact with your school."
574,"Jerry Falwell Jr. needs to stop talking about the coronavirus. Like, now. The news of a coronavirus outbreak in Flint, Michigan, has turned it into a ""joke."" A local emergency coordinator is being blamed for making the spate of cases public and even causing them to spike. ""I was shocked that he would talk about it,"" said one Michigan attorney. In a statement, Falwell said, ""Dr. Falwell's comments were inappropriate and do not reflect my beliefs."" Falwell's spokesman, Craig Newmark, said the Republican leader has the ""wrong view."" ""He's got a long history of saying things that he intends to say in the future,"" Newmark said. It's not true. His comments were out of line with his beliefs. He expects that if he is the GOP nominee, he will be discussing the coronavirus. After the Michigan health department's announcement of the outbreak, it has asked Falwell to stop saying things that infect others. He's not a Republican. He is not a Republican, ""said Newmark, according to the Detroit Free Press. The disease is spread through contact with a person who has had direct contact with an infected person. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that the situation"" is ongoing. ""But it's a new and unprecedented outbreak of the disease. The CDC said it received 46 cases of the virus last month. This is the second outbreak in Michigan this year. According to the state, 60 cases have been reported.

The current outbreak of coronavirus is a joint infections between two outbreaks of illnesses associated with a different strain of the virus. There are about 1,200 cases reported in the U.S. each year, and most of those cases are traced to a mosquito that spreads the virus through insects. The disease has swept through more than a dozen states. A total of 2,280 people have been diagnosed with the virus in the United States and the virus has been linked to 11 deaths.

575,"Trump's positions on FISA and coronavirus responses stoking anxiety on Capitol Hill Last Updated Mar 7, 2018 3: 12 PM EST President Trump has taken a strong stance on his own surveillance programs and surveillance programmes, challenging Justice Department attorneys to testify that they have uncovered ""significant evidence"" of wrongdoing by the President. The White House confirmed to CBS News that Mr. Trump spoke about the issue with Justice Department attorneys on Tuesday, and in a statement, the White House said Mr. Trump ""reiterated the importance of the upcoming White House testimony by Chairman and Chief Justice John Roberts on the President's FISA and eavesdropping programs and reiterated that the President has broad power to unilaterally order the removal of surveillance from US citizens."" Mr. Trump's position on the surveillance issue drew intense concern last week when a letter leaked to the news media by The New York Times revealed that the president is discussing using the FISA court ruling to eavesdrop on U.S. citizens. The letter does not name the recipient. A White House official said the president is ""not seeking to reveal the source of the information that's been publicly available from the Washington Post, but rather to reveal whether there's significant evidence of wrongdoing."" The White House official said the officials briefed Mr. Trump about the information. At the White House, a spokesman said the President ""respects the process and intends to cooperate in that process."" The U.S. Attorney's office and Justice Department have declined to comment. On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Mr. Trump ""has no intention of resigning"" from the position. CBS News Chief White House Correspondent Major Garrett reports the White House will continue to push back against the notion that it was a witch hunt. Spicer told reporters Tuesday that the president has repeatedly tried to deflect blame for the problems at the White House. ""The president has been talking about this -- on and off the record,"" Spicer said. He's also been asking for a continuation of that investigation.

576,"The White House calculus on testing President Trump is changing his mind about requiring ""mental health screening"" for all immigrants. On Thursday, Trump asked the Department of Homeland Security to help him decide whether ""any individual who is currently legally represented in the United States should be detained in the country where he or she entered the country."" ""We are in the process of doing that,"" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said at the time. We're not at the point yet of a physical examiner that has the authority to determine any individual that is currently in the country. ""You know, we are not going to make a decision on whether or not there is an individual legal status,"" Spicer added. We'll always have a plan for adjustment, because we believe that's what's best for the country and is best for the American people. Now there are other people, most likely. The president has also asked Rep. Ted Lieu, D-California, to investigate if the Department of Homeland Security is considering giving any detainees the option of a physical examination. This would be a first step in making sure no applicant is an illegal immigrant to the U.S., but it would do little to make the case that the mental health screening would improve the country's immigration system. Trump has already taken steps to improve the economy by deporting almost 11 million undocumented immigrants, and he's argued that the federal government has failed to meet its target of deporting nearly 2 million people. But the White House has said repeatedly that any increase in deportations would be temporary and would not affect everyone. ""It would be wrong to suggest anything else,"" Spicer said, adding that Trump had previously suggested that ""illegal immigration is at an all-time high!"" He said that was just one example of a president who was changing his mind. ""I just wanted to make sure that we were able to work with the DHS to get that right,"" Spicer said. We're going to keep working with them to get it right. Spicer also said there will be no changes to the deportation policy. ""On the issue of the executive order, we've been clear that the department is going to continue to detain and deport illegal aliens,"" Spicer said. We're going to continue to deport people who are in the country legally. We're going to continue to enforce our laws against illegal immigration."
577,"Senate Democrats call for more sanctions against 'Putin's chef' following CNN investigation The Senate Intelligence Committee is demanding that President Donald Trump's administration respond to a CNN report that says Russia is behind other attacks on critical infrastructure including U.S. airplanes and a nuclear plant, according to Democratic Senators. The story states that the Obama administration knew that Russia was planning to disrupt the 2016 elections and that the U.S. intelligence community, in turn, concluded that Russia was behind the attempted hack of the Democratic National Committee and that Trump's campaign team did not collude with Russian operatives. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told CNN on Wednesday the committee's investigation is ""a critical tool in pressuring Russia to interfere with the 2016 U.S. elections."" She also said that U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election as well. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the top Democrat on the panel, said that if Russia is found to have tried to influence the election, it will be investigated. ""If there is information about Russian involvement in that election,"" Warner said, ""it will be subject to further investigations,"" Warner said. Russia denies any involvement in the hack of the Democratic National Committee last year. Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that the Obama White House had warned the Trump administration about Russians ""attempts to influence the election. So what happened during the 2016 election? The U.S. intelligence community concluded in late November that Russia had interfered in the U.S. presidential election and that Trump's campaign team did not collude with Russian hackers to try to influence the election. The intelligence community concluded that Russian hacking attempts could have involved stealing information from Democrats and building a fake app to give Trump's campaign a boost in the polls. The intelligence community has said it believes Russian officials tried to influence the election by trying to recruit Democrats or"" spreading false information ""about the election to help Trump. The Senate intelligence committee has asked the Trump White House to respond to the allegations."" The Committee is also concerned that the Trump administration is not conducting itself in accordance with its obligation to protect the American people from those who seek to harm our country or destroy our democracy, ""Warner said. That is why we will continue to seek a response from the administration. Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http: / / www.twitter.com / etuckerAP.

578,"Trump grows more irate as his attempts to contain coronavirus fallout fail President Donald Trump today threatened to ""totally destroy"" a mosquito that has sickened thousands in the United States and nearly every nation around the world. As a number of countries around the world are on high alert for the virus, Trump tweeted: ""The US has been warned of the deadly Conservation with Zero-Disease (NCDR). It has been a total disaster! In early afternoon, he added:"" When will we all get together and declare that the U.S. is at war? We will totally destroy the Conservation with Zero-Disease (NCDR)! The virus is caused by a coronavirus, a common one that causes deadly flu and can be transmitted to humans through contaminated surfaces such as saliva or sweat. It is not found in poultry but in a variety of other creatures including horses and dogs. At least 12 people have died in the United States and others have been infected. The World Health Organization said that in all, it had treated more than 10,000 cases and killed 596. Despite this, experts said that the death toll could increase because the virus is still circulating and poses no threat to humans. President Barack Obama tried to slow the spread of the disease by declaring a public health emergency in July, but it has been difficult to overcome the virus. ""We're going to see an outpouring of people in the United States coming to Washington, D.C. with signs of the virus,"" Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told CBS News in an interview earlier this week. And we're looking at a massive number of people who could get sick. For now, Washington is not on a health watch list. Still, the virus is spreading quickly in Texas, which is trying to contain the insects. But the WHO said that it expected the disease to only spread elsewhere in the United States by December, as the virus remains in Mexico and Puerto Rico. Last week, experts warned that the virus could also be at its peak in the United States but it would all take months to completely eradicate the disease. Texas Senator Ted Cruz has been calling for the federal government to declare an emergency. He said that while he doesn't agree with Trump's containment strategy, he wants to see the government step up."
579,"Coronavirus leaves students in limbo as campuses scramble to contain pandemic Officials from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warn that the outbreak could have a ""significant"" affect on US schools. ""If anyone has developed a mild fever after travel to Mexico, Mexico or the Caribbean, they should be tested for the virus before they travel,"" the CDC said yesterday. Most schools are open and students can use the bathroom and in some places the school cafeteria. The CDC has been warning students of the virus, which can cause diarrhoea and vomiting, since November 24. One student was diagnosed with the virus in September. More than a dozen states and the District of Columbia have reported cases of the virus since the start of the year. In Texas, two schools have been closed after students were diagnosed with the virus. The Austin Independent School District is closed for the remainder of the academic year. A 15-minute drive from the school, the school's building was locked down, and the entire cafeteria and office building was closed. A senior high school student in Houston was found to have the virus after returning from Mexico. She was diagnosed with the infection in January. ""It doesn't look like you're going to see very much any change in the virus,"" said Michelle Johnson, an epidemiologist at the CDC. It's a bit more contagious, but it's still one or two days away from being able to transmit it. She said that the risk of infection in a person who had recently travelled to Mexico is extremely low. The CDC has predicted that the US will see a ""one or two outbreaks"" of the virus in the coming weeks, but said that it was too early to give an estimate. It is also expecting a ""minimal"" risk of swine flu in the US, but said that there was no need to panic. ""It's too early to say exactly how severe the current outbreak is,"" it said. You don't want people to panic, but we would never have predicted that in the first place. The CDC is asking people to use public restrooms and to avoid eating at uncooked food and drinks, or handling raw food and touching surfaces. ""Patients should take precautions,"" the CDC said. They should wash hands frequently, avoid contact with anyone who has a sick or elderly person, and follow instructions on how to avoid infection."
580,"Why it matters A LOT that Trump hasn't been tested for coronavirus President Trump's actions after a deadly epidemic at a Dallas hotel have become the subject of much scrutiny. The response to the deadly virus has been mixed, however, highlighting the difficulties of fighting the disease. A new study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, challenges one of the answers: why do coronavirus has a lower mortality rate than other viruses. ""The answer is that there is a lot of evidence to suggest that coronaviruses are superior to other viruses,"" said lead author Dr. David Rothberg, a professor of immunology at the University of Mississippi Medical School. He and his colleagues looked at some of the viruses that have caused epidemics in the United States. The authors compared data from a 2012-2017 study of more than 3,000 people in four European countries: Germany, the Czech Republic, France and Belgium. Study participants were asked to report their coronavirus-like mortality rates based on age, sex, race, income, education, body mass index and other factors. The study found that higher rates of coronavirus among those living in the U.S. had coronavirus survival rates that were nearly double those among those in the U.S. Those in the U.S. who shared the same room with someone with coronavirus survived about a 32 percent greater than their counterparts in Germany or France, and a 32 percent greater than those in Germany. But it doesn't prove that sharing a room with the virus reduces coronavirus-like mortality. ""These findings offer a good explanation of why coronavirus is so virulent,"" Rothberg said. ""Because the virus can take up large areas of the body, even that small area can become very virulent,"" he added. But the data also come as an ominous reminder of the dangers of respiratory illnesses, Rothberg added. He noted that the virus has been shown to be resistant to antibiotics, and that high-dose medications are often used to treat the infection. And coronavirus infections can be deadly, especially in people who have had heart attacks, according to the American Heart Association. While it's more common in men, researchers said that more studies are needed to figure out why coronavirus is so virulent. ""We really don't know if this is a causal relationship,"" Rothberg"
581,"Health officials often turn to praising Trump when facing tough coronavirus questions. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found no such evidence. Still, that does not mean the CDC's concerns about Zika are over. Still, the CDC has advised Americans to get a flu shot to protect against the virus, even if on the advice of their doctor, according to the CDC. The CDC is also urging people to get an education about how to prevent and treat the virus. The CDC recommends that people get a flu shot every year, especially if they have a health condition that can cause a serious illness like pneumonia or bronchitis. Officials are also working to create a vaccine for the virus that will be tested on 50 million people. The flu shot has been deemed safe for use and can protect against the virus, but CDC officials are worried about how long people will stay off the vaccine. ""In our data, we are confident that the vaccine is safe,"" Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, said on The Dr. Oz Show. The CDC is also testing a flu shot for fever and coughs for the first time in eight years, according to CBS News. Its stock is also up, with nearly a dozen companies reporting strong sales of the vaccine. The CDC also said it is working to reintroduce a vaccine to prevent and treat the flu. The flu shot is not recommended for children under the age of 18 who are not vaccinated against the virus, according to the CDC. Officials are encouraging people to avoid contact with flu-stricken people who are sick or have symptoms. If a person feels sick, they are advised to call the hospital, and for help if they develop flu symptoms. The CDC says that 90 percent of people who get the vaccine will recover in less than three weeks. ""We can't completely eradicate the flu,"" Frieden said. At the end of the day, the flu vaccine is the best way to protect yourself. According to the CDC, as many as 4 million Americans get the flu each year. It is so important for children to get the flu shot, they say. So a vaccine is now recommended for everyone over the age of 18. It's important to get the vaccine, ""Frieden said. It's OK for everyone to get the flu vaccine, but it's also important for people to get vaccinated."
582,"Here's what Trump's coronavirus emergency declaration does mean The Trump administration has declared a public health emergency for the nation's hospitals and clinics. The declaration, issued Tuesday afternoon, is meant to provide health authorities with more information about the virus that is causing a surge in infections, but the problem is so widespread that it won't be quickly addressed. The Department of Health and Human Services said it could take as long as six months to reach the goal of having the virus suppressed by the public. The declaration allows a public health emergency to happen so long as it is done within 90 days. But the declaration will not be followed by another order that bars the use of federal money to treat the infections. The White House has not provided information on how the emergency declaration will be funded. The declaration will not be available to employees of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or any government agencies that receive federal funding. The NIH's Clinical Center of Excellence will continue to be used as a lab and laboratory. The NIH's Center for Immune Deficiency Diseases is another laboratory for the laboratory that will be closed. This declaration will allow for the suppression of the infections. The declaration is a precautionary step, and officials will be prepared if needed to respond to a potential outbreak. CNN has reached out to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for comment. The latest outbreak was reported on March 28 when a health care worker became infected with a respiratory virus while treating a patient in Kansas. The nurse was diagnosed with the virus upon arrival, according to the CDC. The patient's condition did not improve and he was placed on a respirator. The healthcare worker survived. In addition to the flu, the virus has affected the nasal passages of people between the ages of 2 and 49, as well as pregnant women. The CDC says the virus is ""highly contagious"" and can cause a variety of symptoms including a cough, fever, muscle aches, and a rash. In the meantime, the CDC has received reports of one death from the virus. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Nicole Chavez, Jake Tapper and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.

Even though Sanders has been gaining on Clinton in opinion polls, Biden has been lagging behind Sanders in some national polls. Sanders has not pushed out any other potential vice presidential contender in recent weeks, said political strategist Ana Navarro, a CNN contributor and CNN contributor. He has been trying to appeal to women voters, which Clinton has held steady as a Democratic target since August. She has also been fighting to win Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire. Biden's campaign has taken a new tack, emphasizing that the former Delaware senator is not going to ""pivot"" away from the race. The vice presidential run - and the nomination itself, which he enjoys over Clinton - will become much more important for the 2016 race. This is Biden's third bid for the Democratic nomination. He was the one who ran against President Obama in 2008 and again unsuccessfully in 2012. But Biden's supporters have maintained that he will be the best choice for Hillary Clinton to take the presidency. Their message has been consistent. Biden has been a consistent voice on the issues, ""said a Clinton adviser. He's been an active supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders. He's been active in the president's campaign. Biden will be a key player in Congress. He'll be a key player in the party,"" said Jeffrey M. Birnbaum, a Clinton strategist and Obama strategist. ""He's not going to pivot,"" said Birnbaum. He has done well on the ticket, but he is going to be a key player in the party. Biden will campaign in Iowa on Tuesday and Florida on Wednesday, aides said.

But for the country to begin to make progress for the sake of the country, that would require some political realism, and that would require some kind of willingness to compromise. That's what I think we're going to have to do. Cantor has said he ""would like to see the legislation on the floor before the end of the week."" We're not at the point yet where we can actually negotiate an agreement. We'll see if we can get some agreement, ""he said. But I would hope that it would happen this week. But I don't think they're going to be able to, because the last thing they want is the government shutdown to get back on track. They are not going to be able to get some deal done. They are going to have to stop being so paralyzed by fear and not actually getting the deal done. The real issue in Washington, he added, is ensuring the country doesn't go into an economic crisis. The only thing that we can do right now is to make sure that we create jobs, make sure that we get back on track, and to make sure that America can once again lead the world in making sure that we get the economy moving forward again. That's absolutely our job - to restore confidence in this economy,"" Cantor said. The real issue here is the economy, and the American people have had faith in their government for over half a century. ""And it's not just the economy; it's actually the American people who are struggling right now,"" he added. Right now, it's a crisis. It's not just Congress and the White House, it's these Washington politicians who are not solving this problem. They're sitting on the sidelines. They are not understanding what's important to them. And they're making choices that are driving this crisis. And they are failing. They are not standing in the way of the American people. They're not standing up for what the rest of the world is doing and saying they want to do better. And that's why we need to take action. ""It's absolutely critical that we know that our country is stronger if we get this done,"" he added. And that the Republicans understand that. And that they're willing to negotiate.

585,"Ted Cruz to extend self-quarantine after second interaction with individual who tested positive for coronavirus at Dallas airport The Texas senator was diagnosed with the deadly virus on Thursday and immediately received a diagnosis of the illness. The first known case of the disease occurred on a JetBlue flight from New York to Dallas in October. On the same day, Mr Cruz was on a flight with his wife Heidi. While the airline is required to quarantine passengers in the event of a full-blown case, according to the FAA, ""that's not the case here,"" the agency tells CNN. The information had not been shared with the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the CDC, who are responsible for compiling screening protocols for airlines. The Texas senator was one of the first to be diagnosed. In addition to the Dallas case, the CDC said it had identified five other cases in the United States: Two passengers were infected in Oklahoma and one in Utah. ""This individual was at risk for possibly having contracted the disease outside of the United States and, while the chances of him infecting others with the disease are very remote, the risk of spreading the disease is very small,"" the CDC said. He was treated at the Dallas hospital and is expected to make a full recovery. The US is still investigating other possible cases from the Dallas case. There have been several U.S. cases of coronavirus since the virus was first identified in 1976. When the virus was first identified in 1976, it was found to have infected about 700 people. Coronaviruses are a cousin of the common cold - from the common cold to the common cold, which is caused by viruses. Only patients with a fever, rash, joint pain and a cough are at risk of having the disease. If you have flu-like symptoms, visit the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to get a flu shot. The World Health Organization recommends that every one of us get a flu shot. The current infections are mild and only spread to people who have been in close contact with someone with the virus, such as healthcare workers, who have recently returned from travel. The virus spreads through contact with bodily fluids from the nose and mouth, the eyes, the throat or the surgical site. In the past four years, the CDC has counted seven cases of severe disease."
586,"North Korea has launched at least three unidentified projectiles across the sea since the beginning of last year, while Russia last week accused the US of preparing for another nuclear test. A Russian military official said the two sides are discussing how to limit the risks of a potential conflict, Russian news agencies reported, and agreed to set up a joint task force to coordinate the war games and work on joint measures to protect the country from future nuclear threats. The exercises are expected to be held in November. The exercise comes at a time of heightened tensions between the US and North Korea following Trump's surprise announcement that he would consider a nuclear posture-change agreement with Kim Jong Un. The US president said the agreement was the 'only way to solve the problem of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs without the threat of nuclear annihilation', reports Axios. Russia has called the nuclear posture-change agreement 'dangerous', and has warned it could lead to 'world war', raising tensions between the two countries. North Korea is the only country in the world that has not signed the treaty, and has vowed to develop nuclear missiles capable of hitting the US mainland. Moscow's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Thursday that the US should be careful about the nuclear posture-change agreement reached in the early 1990s, and that Russia has no intention of giving up its nuclear weapons. Speaking to the Rossiya-24 television channel, Lavrov said: 'We are not going to give up our nuclear weapons and nuclear technology. And to do so would be dangerous. It would be a huge mistake. Lavrov also said that he would not expect new sanctions on North Korea.'There is no need to react to those who are threatening Russia with military action,' he said. The US has been taking the lead in negotiations with North Korea to discuss denuclearisation and returning the country to stalled six-nation talks on the nuclear disarmament.'We're not going to see a more aggressive policy from anyone, 'Lavrov said during a briefing on Thursday. He added:' We have made clear that, as the US has said, we do not expect a sudden increase in rhetoric and actions, but we have been very open, clear that we have no intention of giving up our nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons. 'China has been pressing for tougher measures to rein in North Korea, and has said that such measures cannot be' ignored '."
587,"Coronavirus outbreak worsens in Italy and Japan, as situation stabilizes in China A person walks past a dead cow on a farm in Cologne, Germany. Reuters / Christian Hartmann, CBS News) BOSTON -- After spreading panic throughout Italy and Japan, the virus has spread to a large rural area where it has killed 18 people, raising fears for the health of those sickened. The World Health Organization says the strain of Coronavirus (CMV), which causes diarrhea and abdominal pain, has taken hold in Italy, where a patient confirmed to have ""the disease in Italy"" has died. Japan, however, has reported an increase in cases during the weekend -- a significant escalation from the previous week when CMV caused nine deaths in the country. In Cologne, the center of the outbreak, some city employees are still fearful of coming down with the disease. Meanwhile, a study published in the Lancet suggests the virus is spreading very rapidly in China, where it's spreading fast at an alarming rate. More than 3,000 people in China have been sickened by the virus, and the number is expected to triple. Beijing has been waging a massive public health campaign to contain the outbreak, and has also set up a quarantine center in Shenzhen, in the southwestern province of Guangdong, to contain the outbreak. But some experts warn that a new wave of infections could be on the way. ""The virus is starting to spread,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. There's a lot of uncertainty that it will transmit into humans. Scientists haven't been able to identify a specific virus that might be responsible for the increased cases. But they do know that the strain of CMV is different than the one that is circulating in Asia. ""If you don't know it, you're going to have CMV infections,"" Schaffner said. And it's not just the more dangerous strain of CMV. Schaffner urged parents to reduce their risk of getting sick from the disease by washing their hands frequently, making sure their children get plenty of rest and avoiding eating food supplied by food companies. ""Now we need to figure out how to protect young kids,"" he said. We don't know if the virus is going to spread worldwide or in Europe."

The first Chinese president to visit the city, Xi was greeted on Friday by locals and the press. He is the most senior Chinese government official to date to visit the region, which was hit by its worst ever outbreak of the virus last week. Xi is expected to visit the city of Wuhan on Saturday. The first stage of his visit has already been attended by thousands of people. Many of them are well-treated and are all well-looked after. China's internet users have been urging the president to stay in his hospital room for days. As China's leader Xi has made building a moderately prosperous country an important objective. There's also an ongoing effort to clean up. The new health inspection measures were launched last month. The clean-up of the city is expected to take at least three months. The new outbreak is the worst since 1918. The World Health Organisation has raised its alert levels to phase 5, meaning China is considered at risk. According to the latest official figures, China was the country with the most cases of the disease last year. According to officials, the World Health Organisation has raised the level of the country's alert to phase 5, where the country is at risk of a new outbreak. Meanwhile, the United States has warned about the highly contagious coronavirus, which can cause inflammation of the lungs and can lead to death. The new strain of the virus has not been found in the United States. Experts say there are no confirmed human cases of the virus and that it is hard to pinpoint where it originated. The disease was first identified in 1976 in Shanghai, which had its largest outbreak ever. At the time, WHO had described it as ""probably the most serious and severe disease in the world."" It is spread by contact with infected mosquitoes. Only 10 countries have been affected, with only two, India and Russia, having experienced outbreaks in the past decade. The WHO says more than 40 countries are at risk from the disease, despite the World Health Organisation predicting there will be no cases this year. China has been the biggest importer of Chinese pork product over the past decade, as it seeks to reduce its dependence on pork. The cost of imported pork has been high."

590,"South Korea has' passed the peak 'of the coronavirus outbreak, health minister hopes Image copyright Getty Images Image caption High body temperature makes it hard for all the coronaviruses to multiply The South Korean government is preparing to pass the ""peak"" level of the outbreak of the highly contagious respiratory illness coronavirus (SARS), health minister Joo Hyun-min has said. The virus is transmitted by close contact with infected people. The government is also taking measures to control outbreaks. The outbreak is suspected to be the most severe in SARS history. While there is no cure, the current outbreaks can be treated with antibiotics and injections. In addition, hospitals are being trained to make sure they take adequate measures to prevent SARS cases. Mr Joo is expected to visit North and South Korea next week to discuss efforts to curb the spread of the disease. SARS first appeared in China in 2002 and has since spread to at least 40 countries. It is believed that it originated in Asia and crossed from Europe to Europe by air. Mr Joo told a news conference that four people had died since the outbreak started, all of them in the South. A total of 276 people were diagnosed with the virus in the South in 2016 - more than double the 347 cases from 2015. Nearly half of them had been in hospitals since December, and one person died. ""We have passed the peak,"" he said. We are now preparing to go back to the drawing board and study the situation accordingly. The number of SARS cases caused by the SARS outbreak has dropped dramatically, from 45 cases in 2003 to 29 cases in 2014, according to the World Health Organization. Coronaviruses are a type of respiratory illness. It is not clear how the two diseases can multiply. Doctors have warned that the time it takes to prevent infection is becoming increasingly untenable as the virus gains strength. The World Health Organization says that the ""peak"" of the outbreak is about two weeks. It says the number of cases is likely to continue to rise, and is expecting even more cases to be reported by the end of the year. According to the latest figures, the numbers of confirmed cases of coronavirus have fallen significantly. The World Health Organization says that the SARS outbreak has now been over by Christmas. It is estimated that the number of new infections is now around"

In the north, they were worried about infection, and we saw the virus spread at the weekend. Italian health authorities said that the new cases of the virus occurred in a small area of northern Italy, and that the most recent was linked to a remote forest in the south of the country. The World Health Organization said on Friday that there were 109 new cases in the Americas and Europe, but its figures could not be confirmed. The virus has been declared a global health emergency by the European Union, with 159 cases reported in 12 countries. Speaking from Rome, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said: ""We are aware of the new cases of the coronavirus in countries that have experienced outbreaks of this disease."" Erasmus, who had been in the Italian capital for five days, said: ""We are in a difficult situation at the moment. The situation is very bad. In a place that is well-populated, people are very scared. They're very worried that they will be exposed to the virus and they're very afraid. I hope we can get out as soon as possible. I hope we have a vaccine and that our children won't be severely affected. Italy's Health Minister Beatrice Lorenzin said:"" The coronavirus is highly infectious and there is no cure. The risk of infection is low but the risk of death is very high. The risk of infection here is very low. A new virus has been identified in Italy - a new strain of coronavirus - which has been named after the Italian physician who developed the disease. It is based on a different strain of coronavirus called STEC. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) advises against travel to Italy after the latest outbreak. Its website says: ""The risk of contracting the virus in countries covered by the current surveillance programme is extremely low."" It says the risk of infecting other people with the coronavirus in Europe is ""very low."" No new cases have been reported.

593,"March 8 coronavirus news - Telegraph The disease, which is spread by infected boiled eggs at hospitals and care homes and usually kills about 20 people a year, is thought to be spread from infected pigs to humans. The number of fatalities caused by the disease increased by almost two-thirds in the past three years. A total of 158 people have died from the disease as of January this year with 199 of those deaths in England. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) said there was a ""high incidence"" in the UK between 1999 and 2006. Last month, the HPA warned the spread of the virus to the country must be traced back to ""widespread"" outbreaks of the disease. It said no major cases were being reported in the UK. The virus has now reached the southern half of England, the HPA said, and has spread south to Sussex and eastern parts of Kent. In January, the HPA advised people to wash their hands frequently, be vigilant and follow advice from healthcare professionals. A spokesman said: ""The infection can spread from person to person, and can look like boils or other contaminated surfaces. As the infection has already affected pigs, people are advised to disinfect the hands of people who come into direct contact with pigs. And if you see any of the signs, contact your GP immediately. NHS England said some people with the disease had been admitted to hospital for treatment, while others had been discharged. The HPA said the number of reported cases in England had increased to 1,058. It said further cases were likely to emerge over the next few days. The HPA said the number of deaths was increasing as a result of the outbreak. The spread of the virus is thought to have been caused by a bacterium known as the Ebola virus which was first discovered in 1976. A 2003 outbreak triggered by foot-and-mouth disease in the UK resulted in the first fatality from the disease. The HPA said the number of cases could rise as the virus was discovered in pigs and that infection control measures were being enhanced. A spokeswoman added:"" This disease, which is more uncommon in humans as it is more easily transmissible between people, is often spread through contact with infected pigs and then by eating infected meat. ""HPA officials said the number of confirmed cases is rising and cases could reach 2,000 by Easter. Click here to read more on this story from Sky News."
594,"Italy announces lockdown as global coronavirus cases surpass 105,000 Italy on Monday authorized a nationwide lockdown of schools and universities in the wake of the outbreak of a global coronavirus, which has killed thousands and was blamed on the use of a vaccine in two European countries. The country's health minister said the nationwide measure would start at schools, universities and colleges in the northeastern region of Liguria, the area in which the outbreak began. The country's health ministry also said it would start spreading the coronavirus around schools starting next week. ""The coronavirus is a serious disease that affects at least 60 to 70 percent of people in Italy,"" health minister Beatrice Lorenzin told reporters. We don't want to see the spread of this disease. Italy's health ministry measured the number of suspected cases of the illness to have reached 105,000. Of those, 2,500 have either died or been hospitalized, with the rest having either recovered or been discharged from hospitals. The outbreak has sparked an international outcry over the handling of the outbreak, which Italy's experts say is probably brought on by a strain of the disease not transmitted by pigs. Since the virus was first identified in New Zealand in August, it has infected more than 500 in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Chile, China, Israel and Spain, the World Health Organization said on Sunday. The virus spreads through close contact with an infected person. In a statement, the New Zealand Department of Health said the outbreak was being closely monitored by health authorities in New Zealand and South Africa. The ministry said the total number of cases since the outbreak began was expected to be ""significantly higher"" than that. The World Health Organization said in its latest report that the virus was being spread through close contact with a person who had not known it was contagious. It said the virus was likely to be transmitted to humans from animals or people who had been exposed to infected animals. The agency said on Sunday that it had sent some 700 investigators and staff to South Africa to help determine the source of the outbreak.

In fact, this is so rare that it is actually too rare to tour as far as the United States. Tara Siegel has found a site near you, just south of the site of the bomb that killed the president, and you can track it right here. Here they are just a few minutes from the site of Hiroshima, the scene of the world's worst nuclear attack in the Second World War. After the war, the area was a thriving tourist destination and was once a thriving breeder of North African slaves. Today it's a city of only about 10,000 people. It has suffered from more than a century of war and is still suffering from the loss of life lost in the bombing. Just a short walk from the site is the infamous Twin Towers - the skyscraper that fell. Only about 50 people live there today, but the area has changed drastically over the years, and the fact that it sits on a subway wall is just one of the things that makes it so unique. Many of the buildings on the subway line are still standing, but the elevators are still being used by locals. How can you be a part of the history of Hiroshima? The United States bombed Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, at the end of World War II. The U.S. conducted a total of 1,888 bombing raids from Aug. 6 to Sept. Today the city is a mix of civilian and military groups. Many of the civilian organizations that work to protect the city are made up of people who are highly trained in bomb-making. For example, the U.S. Air Force's Fifth Bomb Wing conducted at least 19 of the most effective bombing raids in the world during WWII, according to the Department of Defense. Two of the bombers were the B-52 Stratofortress, which was the first American bomber to fly into Hiroshima. But the other bomber did not do the bombing, and it's thought as many as two-thirds of the U.S. bombing raids were in the hands of American pilots. But some of the bombing raids were carried out by the Japanese. They were not always successful, and by the Sixties, the United States put out more than 60 raids in the city as a number of bombs fell."
596,"They plan to march for gender equality. In Pakistan, that has caused outrage among women's rights campaigners, who say that the new law could be used to silence women's voices. The new law would not even apply to non-Muslims, such as those accused of adultery or apostasy. The authorities could make amendments to it to allow women to join the march, but the opposition is opposed to the move because it would be an unconstitutional act. Mr Yadav says he will use the new law to make it harder for women to join the protests. ""We are going to march because we want to push for the rights of women and minorities,"" he said. But if it is passed, the existing law will be reformed and would allow women to be arrested for attending a rally. The new law could also lead to a woman being harassed on social networking sites. The internet has become so much more of a social commentary than a real one. Last week, three women were arrested as they tried to march, a move that provoked widespread condemnation from women's rights activists. The first of the three women, Channa Khesar, was given a two-year suspended prison sentence by a court in Lahore for posting an online video of her husband's rape. A second, Asma Jahangir, was sentenced to five years for posting public comments on YouTube. The third, Shazia Ahmed, was given a one-year suspended prison sentence; she was convicted of posting comments on Facebook about Mr Yadav and for posting photos of him in a bikini and holding up her top. Mr Yadav told Pakistan's Hurriyat News: ""I am 100 per cent confident that the new law will lead to the revision of the law, which will allow women to join the march."" The state government has said it will pass a law that will allow women to join the march, but the opposition has already said that the law will only be amended if the Supreme Court overturns the conviction. They say this will be a major test for women's rights in Pakistan. The ban on women marching was introduced in May 2012 following the murder of a Shia Muslim woman by her husband, Sajjad Ali Yadav, in the eastern city of Lahore. It followed a wave of attacks on Shia mosques and a series of bomb attacks on the police and army."

We are also looking at whether we can make it harder for people to buy fake vaccines. Experts have warned that many untested vaccines are likely to have been contaminated by the virus. This is something we are working through with the manufacturers of the flu vaccine. The best way to avoid getting a flu infection is to cover your mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. The virus can cause serious or life-threatening infections in babies, the elderly and anyone without a family history of the virus, but the majority of people who contract the virus are not protected. The new coronavirus outbreak comes as a number of UK schools have sent parents home early from school in the wake of the recent outbreak. Thousands of pupils were sent home from school in September after an outbreak of the virus at a primary school in Norfolk. The HPA said the flu vaccine is ""safe to use with good food hygiene"" and the latest figures showed that more than half of school-leavers aged between 12 and 19 had this vaccine. The Department of Health said there is no reason to panic and that the new coronavirus virus is being treated like other flu. ""It is not the end of the world,"" a spokesman said. The number of cases is very low due to the limited resources in the country and schools may be reluctant to open if many schools are closed. We are working with the World Health Organisation and the health authority to strengthen the surveillance systems in schools. We are working with the pharmaceutical industry as well as the manufacturers of the flu vaccine, to ensure that the best clinical practice is followed. The Department of Health added that it was working with the World Health Organisation (WHO) in a ""robust"" effort to prevent infection in schools. ""The WHO has an excellent track record of vaccination against viruses,"""

599,"Eat more plants and less meat to live longer and improve heart health, study suggests The two findings are in line with a study conducted by Sir David Spiegelhalter, director of the Winton Centre for the Public Understanding of Risk at Cambridge University, who found people who ate more meat and vegetables to live longer and had a lower risk of heart disease than those who ate less meat. ""It is well known that eating more fruit and vegetables to keep your heart healthy is excellent and may protect against heart disease and stroke,"" said Prof Spiegelhalter, a professor of psychiatry at University College London. Our study demonstrates the role of eating a variety of fruits and vegetables in a healthy diet to reduce your risk of heart disease. Another study, carried out by researchers at the University of Surrey, compared more than 3,500 adults from Britain and the United States who eat the same amount of fruit and vegetables daily to the participants who skipped red meat because they could not easily tolerate it. But they found that although skipping red meat made people live less healthy, it was not the only reason people spent more time on a red diet. ""Even though these people had a higher cancer risk and a lower cancer risk, they were not smoking than people without susceptibility of cancer,"" said Professor John Wilkinson, the professor of nutrition at the University of Cambridge. The findings were reported in the International Journal of Epidemiology. Prof Wilkinson urged the UK government to introduce a programme of healthy eating with a focus on reducing red meat consumption to target cancer and heart disease. The Department of Health, which will publish the findings later this year, said: ""The research supports current Government advice and we look forward to seeing more results later this year."" But campaigners expressed disappointment. Dr Tanya Byron, of the Centre for Public Health Research at King's College London, said: ""These results are not surprising, but not a surprise. We will need to wait for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to publish its findings in the autumn so that we can better understand what is happening. The study was carried out by 737 people between 1986 and 2010. The latest results were provided by the National Diet and Nutrition Survey, which was set up in 2007 to track the impact of the Millennium Development Goals and the World Health Organisation's Millennium Development Goals."

The government has already started selling beer in Vietnam, but it is still very limited. That's why you should try Hanoi's ""beer hoi"" ($1.80), which is made with seawater and contains the equivalent of an ounce of beer. It's supposed to be sold in bars and restaurants to impress bar owners and to attract tourists. But in recent years the government has raised prices of the seawater, and last year it increased the price of the beer by 1.5%. ""I think the prices of the beer are too high,"" said Chung Wai Thuong, a Hanoi taxi driver. I only bought the beer in Hanoi when I was a young girl. The beer's price has gone up by 23% since 2007, according to the government. The company that makes the beer, Cu Wan Hou Dai, says it's up to the government to regulate prices. It's not the first time it's been affected by government regulation. In 2010, the government banned the sale of alcoholic beverages with more than 8 grams of sugar per liter, a measure that was deemed harmful to health.

604,"16 Japan experiences every traveler needs to enjoy their holidays, but most travel companies don't offer coupons or special discounts for customers who exchange their getaways for one-night breaks. So travelers will have to ask themselves what type of trip they're really here for. For those who are not traveling on vacation, a coupon is the most common way to get a free hotel room if you travel overseas. However, it's not all about money -- one traveler might have to save up for a trip to Taiwan. The U.S. Travel Association found that a one-night stay in a three-star hotel in Japan - or anywhere in Asia, at least - can cost as little as $40. The first resort to offer a coupon is China's Grand Hyatt. The hotel offers a travel voucher for the price of one room and is offering the discount for one night in each room. The same is true of hotels in Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Malaysia.

607,"Preserving Macao's bamboo tradition through sculptural works As one of the world's oldest and most important sources of raw materials, Macao's bamboo industry is one of the world's oldest and most important. The industry supports more than one million jobs in the territory, and its growing importance is illustrated in this video by Peter Yeo, a professor of anthropology at the University of British Columbia. Yeo shows some of the earliest examples of a Macanese bamboo, which dates back to about 13,500 years ago. Video Journalist: Yulia Vasilyeva Chen in Macao; Editing by Michael Perry and Philippa Fletcher Related: The changing face of Macao's bamboo industry The natural wealth of the Tian Dynasty, a territory which stretches across much of China, has enabled it to emerge as one of the world's most desirable destinations for the production of raw materials, from luxury cars and motorcycles to restaurants and construction materials. When Yeo met Chinese artist Li Shuxin - who made custom-made silk tiles to feature at the opening of the Tian Dynasty Museum in September - he was inspired to create a work of art inspired by the Tian dynasty. ""It felt so right,"" he says. I started when I was doing my research about the Tian Dynasty with my grandson. Li began to do custom-made fabrics for the Tian dynasty, using traditional Tibetan embroidery. ""He came to visit me in New York,"" explains Li, who studied in Beijing and the Tai'an capital, Beijing. Li's work features the Tian dynasty's traditional architecture, such as a casement, ruler, goddess and a roundhouse. The work was selected for its ""dynamism, dynamism and energy,"" says Yeo. ""I wrote a simple poem that he wrote with a Chinese translation"" It's not like you're a dynasty, but it's more like a living thing. """" The Tian dynasty, which was founded in 1644, is one of the most enduring of any Chinese-speaking civilisation. From the first pharaoh to the current monarch, it has dominated the region. An estimated 60% of Tian dynasty children are born outside of China."
608,"Preserving Macao's handmade signs in the digital age But as far as the new visitors are concerned, they should have had their windows open on that day. They should have known that the people who walked in were also the Macanese. Despite the huge crowds, there are still few signs, but the Macanese will still be at the heart of this massive tourism exchange. ""We are not just here to welcome tourists, we will be the people who will bring Macau back to its glory days,"" said Ms Chen. We need Macao to be the second most visited destination in the world when it comes to tourism. Macau's new minister for trade, trade and tourism is Chen Tao. Back in 2003, Mr Chen, then a cabinet minister, was on a trade mission to Macau. He also talked to the Dalai Lama. He said he wanted to see the world's greatest Buddhist leader visit the region now that it is self-administered. His visit has been held up by questions about whether Macau is ready to host the world's largest tourist market, such as Las Vegas. Despite the concerns, the big crowds that walked on the last day of 2008 may have brought the city back to its former glory days. The old days, of course, were still fresh in the minds of some tourists. ""We can't get carried away,"" said Ms Chen. We know that the present Macao is still in its infancy. I think we are going to see a lot more changes. The new government has promised to make Macau, a strategic destination for tourists, a world leader in tourism. Tourism accounts for about a tenth of Macau's GDP. However, the number of tourists is expected to fall from two million a year today to just one million in 2010, although it is not yet expected to fall any further. There are currently no signs in Macau suggesting that the future is bright. ""We are expecting visitors to stay for a long time, and I am sure that is not our intention,"" said Ms Chen. In the next decade we will see a lot more tourists from everywhere, but Macau will be the place to be for a long time yet. The story of the world's most talked about city is the story of Macau, and the world will look to Macao as a model. It should be no surprise that even at the height of its fame, Macau remains a giant in the world."

611,"The master shipbuilder keeping Macao's maritime past alive -- in miniature A major shipbuilding centre dedicated to the memory of the late Hong Kong shipping tycoon was built on Macao's pier, but the project has been plagued with delays and cost overruns. Duration: 01: 46 The story so far this week has been quite a success. The story so far in Hong Kong has been quite a success. On a remarkable day, which saw the Chinese city's best-known design go on display, the world's largest cruise ship, the CSCL Shanghai, was launched in the city. After taking seven weeks to complete, it was the fourth ship of its kind to dock across the Chinese mainland during the five-day trip. Although the ship, one of the world's largest, took seven weeks to dock, the operation received mixed reviews. The ship is currently undergoing a period of extensive refurbishment by the China Maritime Administration and the Beijing Maritime Administration. It will be slowly rebranded as the Hong Kong-China International Shipping and Carrier Corporation, after being renamed the China International Shipping Corporation. The ship has been christened the CSCL Shanghai, after Hong Kong's legendary shipping entrepreneur Tommy Yang. The ship, which had a capacity of 3,500 tons, will now be renamed the CSCL Shanghai. The ship was inaugurated at the Chinese port of Tianjin on Friday. The ship will be the first of a series of Asian ships called the CSCL Class, of which the CSCL Class is the second ship and is the largest in Chinese class. The ship will be a partnership between South Korea, China and Japan. It has already been christened the South Korean-made Glory Shipping. The CSCL Shanghai is due to be sailing to Hong Kong in 2018. One of the latest designs has also been unveiled: the first ship to dock in China's second largest port, Shenzhen, for the first time. As many as 3,000 vessels will take part in the event. Last November, The South China Morning Post reported that the construction of the ship had been put on hold, despite the agreement of Hong Kong's government to the CSCL Shanghai. Meanwhile, construction work on a second ship, the first to dock in Hong Kong, is still ongoing. The CSCL Shanghai is scheduled to dock in Shenzhen in 2018."
612,"Tokyo transformed: Global sporting events put spotlight on Japan's capital But for Japan and other countries in the region, the Olympics proved very much a high point. When the opening ceremony was held in Tokyo last year, the country had a proud history of hosting major sporting events, a testament to the country's incredible economic power and uncanny array of cultural and natural attractions. But the Paralympics, from the start of the 2016 Summer Games to the closing ceremony on Friday, revealed a country in flux. The Games brought the world to a different level of interest. And this time around, people feel more connected to watching it on television. The Paralympics represent everything that is great about sports and culture in Japan. I think that is true for all Japanese, ""said Koji Tanaka, a former Paralympian. The Tokyo Games were a major event when the economy was in a crisis, and the country's economy suffered a blow when its citizens voted overwhelmingly to impeach Shinzo Abe, the prime minister. The Paralympic Games themselves had an unexpected presence: the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics. More than 70,000 athletes took part, including tens of thousands of other athletes from 30 nations."" We made the decision that we'd do this for the benefit of the Paralympians as a community, ""said Ryoji Tatsuya, chair of the Tokyo Organizing Committee. While the athletes were coming to Tokyo, Japan's economy was thriving. Japan's economy grew at a 3.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter of 2017, the fastest pace since the world was in recession and the government had been forecasting a pick-up in the second quarter. It now expects GDP to pick up at an annual rate of 1.7 percent in the second quarter, up from an initial estimate of 1.1 percent. The nation's economy grew 4 percent in the final three months of last year, which was a record for the country. But it's been much slower in recent years, so many of the players will now be joining the Paralympics at a packed Tokyo Stadium. And the athletes will be competing for the biggest prize of all: an opportunity to showcase their skills and bring home gold medals. More than 2,500 athletes from 40 nations made the trip from Tokyo to the stadium. NBC's Lester Holt, David Morgan, Mark Strassmann, James Masters and Domenico Montanaro contributed to this report.

Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing was opened by the city as part of the International Shibuya Festival in March. The bridge was created by Japanese engineers and constructed by the city's public works department. Visitors to the intersection can walk over the concrete to reach the intersection before being given directions to the crossing. Once through the bridge visitors can cross the intersection and walk down a corridor, where they can pick up a cup of coffee, eat a sandwich and check out a view of the city. The event provides Japanese companies with the opportunity to work on construction sites in the country. Shibuya Crossing: the world's first intersection The crossing was completed in 2015. It was expected to be completed by the end of March. But the project was delayed after the collapse of the embattled project's main contractor, Mitsui Kyubei. The bridge was designed from scratch using materials from more than 100 countries. It was built by the Japanese engineering firm, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and resembles the one in Japan's Tokyo. It took 20 months to complete the project, but was completed last December. The bridge is the world's first intersection, with Japan being one of the world's most advanced economies. Regarding the bridge, the Shibuya Crossing project was a joint project between the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the Shibuya Technical University.

615,"The story behind Vietnam's' Crazy House' Vietnam has had a lot of its own problems with soaring inflation, but the economic boom has been a boom for the country's film industry. One of the key reasons for this is the popularity of ""Crazy Rich Asians,"" which began airing on Asian television in 2012. The film was directed by the late James Wan, and stars Hong Chau. But as a few of the best movies in the world, including the ""Godzilla"" films and the fantasy sequels, it has also seen a surge in popularity among Vietnamese viewers. It is like this.

In a press release, the Vietnamese government said it had ordered an investigation into the film and would take further measures. We will take necessary measures to prevent these movies from being released in Vietnam. There can be no place for evil in our country and we will never compromise on a country's culture,"" Tai Geng, who is acting director of the government's Department of Cultural Heritage, said.

618,"Pornhub offers quarantined Italians free access to their pornography Online porn is being offered free of charge to Italians who are unable to access their pornography on the site. The offer was made in a series of adverts on the adult site, Pornhub Italy, in an effort to ensure that the site remains open and accessible to the general public. ""For the first time since being created in 2000, the Italian porn industry has been able to access the freedom of the public,"" Pornhub Italy's president, Andrea Guerra, told The Guardian. This is a huge relief. The controversial move comes in the wake of reports of an increase in the number of unwanted sexual images being shared on the site, which has become infamous for posting explicit images of women. In an effort to tackle the problem, over 200 pornography websites are being investigated by Italian authorities. The site is one of the most popular in Italy and is popular among women, men over 30 and people who are not in the know. The adverts are available on the site until May 1. Read more: Italians make porn scene 'safer' due to porn laws Visit Pornhub Italy for free to watch videos Porn sites are 'not currently the same', say internet giants Porn was banned in Italy last year, but the law still does not apply to adult content. After taking action to try and prevent people viewing pornography on the site, there is little chance that the site will change in the near future. In addition, Italy's Culture Minister Dario Franceschini has launched an ""anti-pornography"" initiative, which includes new laws criminalising online pornography, as well as a crackdown on the image-sharing website Twitter. The latest advert, which was made in response to reports that the website was also being monitored by the Guardia di Finanza, is on the website with the date of the expiry of the offer. The original advert also listed the costs that would be incurred by people who used the site to view the images, and said that the offer would be valid for a month.

619,"The Clanwilliam cedar survived the last ice age, but its future hangs in the balance. It was recovered from the sea in 1807 and has remained in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, south-east London, since. Its collection of 1,900 treasures is now at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. A spokesman for the museum said: ""The artefacts from this cedar are very precious to us, our collection is very important to both of us, and it is so sad that we have had to take this decision to close the museum. It is very unfortunate that the National Maritime Museum would seek the closure of its final cedar collection on the basis of these historical artefacts. We are therefore very grateful to the British Museum for giving the cedar material this valuable time. The British Museum has already removed the two-headed, female Cedar from its collection and is considering the possibility of taking the cedar back to Greenwich. The cedar was found in the sea on a beach in Dorset and was the final cedar to be found in the British Isles. The Cedar Society said the findings showed the importance of preserving cedar in Britain. Spokesman Peter Sellers said:"" Cedar and its related cedar species are particularly threatened by climate change and have been listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as critically endangered. The UK Wildlife Trusts and the UK Heritage Lottery Fund are working together to protect these species and will work together to ensure that this beautiful cedar remains in the UK. The cedar cedar was discovered in the sea near the Isle of Man on the Isle of Man by a group of fishermen. The discovery was made in 1909 and is thought to be the last of the UK's original cedar species to survive. Its skeleton was first discovered in 2007 and dated to the late 1920s. It is now too fragile to be moved and is thought to be in poor condition. The cedar is estimated to have been about two years older than the cedar itself. The British Museum's collections are now open to visitors. It costs £13 for adults and £7.50 for children. The National Maritime Museum is the oldest museum in the world. It houses around 470 artefacts."

621,"Apple says it's fine to wipe your iPhone with a Clorox wipe when you're done using it, a warning that comes as Apple is reporting strong sales of its iPhone 6S and 6S Plus despite the latest models being cracked by battery fires. The report came on Monday before an expected report on iPhone sales at the end of the week. In a statement, the company said that it had taken corrective measures after the issue. It said that it had asked app developers to change the way that apps were integrated with the new iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus. Apple said that it would ""fix"" the problem before it releases the new phones. It said that it would make the necessary updates and will compensate everyone who bought a new iPhone 6S or iPhone 6S Plus on its App Store. The world's biggest tech company has also announced that it is changing the way that iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are built. Apple did not disclose any details of the revamp, but Apple said that its products had ""many of the same protective features and built-in technology,"" including the built-in fingerprint sensor, the built-in touch-screen control for iOS and the home button for the AirPods. The move is part of a wider overhaul of Apple's products and is part of a broader marketing campaign emphasising its commitment to safety and security. The company said that after an investigation, Apple had found a ""minor"" safety issue with the AirPods. Apple has sold more than 1 million iPhones since the product's launch in 2007. It is also building a new operating system for iOS that includes an improved home button. According to the company, less than half of Apple's global sales come from outside the US. In a statement, Apple said that ""the safety and security of our products are our top priority. We are working with the relevant agencies and customers to understand the cause. We are pleased we have heard about this issue and will be carrying out a thorough investigation. We have confirmed that we are working with app developers to make further improvements to strengthen our product offerings. We appreciate your comments and continue to improve our products and processes. Apple is also set to hold a news conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. It is expected to say that it will announce its new iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus models before the start of the conference. It could make similar announcements later in the day."
622,"Why oil prices are crashing and what it means for your pension Millions of us with smaller pension pots will be forced to sell their property if the cost of living rises and the value of their homes is affected. Our collective pension pots have grown by more than £2,600 a year since 1988, according to the Office for National Statistics. The value of our pots has more than doubled, reaching £1.7trillion last year. This has helped keep people living longer and helping to protect income from inflation, a report by investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown suggests. As a result, older people with large pension pots have seen their savings eroded by inflation. Some £1.7 trillion was wiped off the value of their homes in the first ten years of the millennium. While the value of their homes has risen by £2,600, this has helped keep some of these pots intact. This is because the current rising prices have brought down the value of the pots in the past when the savings were being ploughed into a pension. As a result, pots with a deficit of at least £1 million have been in deficit for at least five years. This is because over time the value of their assets has increased. The pension deficit has grown by £600, from £1.7 trillion to £2.1 trillion. In other words, this means that people with large pension pots have been hit by inflation. The growth in the value of their pots has also been heavily affected by the rise in the price of oil. At the start of the millennium prices were rising by around 20% a year. ""The increase in the cost of living has led to a number of people becoming less comfortable about investing in their pension and therefore have put a number of them on a negative outlook,"" a spokesperson for Hargreaves Lansdown told The Telegraph. Even if you're buying an annuity you'll have to make sure you do your research and ask your bank if you can afford the income you have now. Also, if you have a pension with the income you now have, you can only invest it in the stock market. If you do decide to sell your home, the value of your pots will increase. The increase in wealth will affect some people as the value of their property goes up - but will still be worth some £35,000 for someone with £100,000. And you will not have to worry about the next pensioner."
623,"China boasts massive car and aviation markets. Both collapsed in February, and the currency began to slide rapidly. In August, the People's Bank of China loaned short-term money to the beleaguered auto industry in an effort to prop up the market. But auto sales have been slowing in China, and while the government has said it is open to allowing foreign auto trading, there are concerns about the strength of the economy. Beijing has already intervened to prop up the ailing auto industry. Last week, the government said it would provide loans of 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) to help automakers, as well as an additional 2.8 trillion yuan ($32.6 billion) to lenders. Meanwhile, automakers are facing a stiff challenge from the government. Car sales in China fell 19 percent in July from a year earlier, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Auto sales in the first half of 2018 were down 25 percent from the same period last year. Chinese officials have also blamed the auto makers for the country's economic slowdown. The state-owned China Development Bank warned last month that the country's economic growth had slowed to 8.7 percent last year, a level that would give it the world's second-highest GDP. But Zhu Wei, the vice governor of the State Council, China's cabinet, told CNBC on Tuesday that any slowdown in the economy is temporary. CNBC's Judy Kwon and Yin Xue contributed to this report.

The latest city to build a resort in Miami Bay at such a high rate of development has not won any major planning awards, but its construction is attracting attention from local leaders. ""I don't know where there's going be a new hotel for all the beach, but I would imagine there are some decent boutique hotels that will be around here that will be close to what Miami Beach is currently offering,"" said Miami Beach Councilman Jose Hernandez. Hernandez said that one such boutique hotel, the ""W Marriott in the Plaza,"" has already been built. It was last summer when it was planned that the city would build a hotel that would rival Hilton's iconic One & Only Plaza in an area with a waterfront boardwalk and an airport. But after the local economy tanked, the hotel did not open with a major investment. ""The hotel did not open with a major investment,"" Hernandez said. They were looking for a new hotel, but they couldn't find one here. The hotel now has 1,800 rooms, seven condominiums, four restaurants and a 24-hour security system. The hotel has also been named in the National Register of Historic Places. Hernandez said the new hotel - being built on a sandy part of the island - will be the first in the city for eight years. ""Miami Beach is home to an incredible amount of history and, along with the amazing restaurants and hotels, it has a great reputation,"" he said. However, it's not just Miami Beach that is drawing investment.

626,"Climate change: How rich people could help save the planet New research has revealed young people can help to save the planet by contributing to a new £7m fund to raise awareness about the threat of climate change. Climate Change Research Collaboration (CDRC) brings together leading scientists and academics in the UK, France, Germany, Sweden and the US to examine how policies and processes can help to reduce climate change. The new fund will give the UK's universities and colleges the money to produce and deliver a range of climate change and related research designed to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Climate change is the biggest threat facing mankind, but it is not uncommon for people to feel some of the consequences for the environment. The CDRC, which has been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (which has supported projects to tackle climate change in the UK), has launched an online tool enabling scientists, policy-makers and the public to see what action they can take in conjunction with academics and the public. The fund will target innovative ideas and methods to increase climate change awareness. Its creation is the result of an initiative between the CDRC and the UK's leading universities and colleges. The UK's universities and colleges are committed to tackling climate change by developing climate change research models, and the UK government has committed to invest in climate research. The UK government is also investing in the climate science research sector and Climate Change Research Collaboration (CRED) is bringing together academics and business leaders to tackle climate change issues. The CDRC is currently working with the universities and colleges to develop solutions to global challenges, including measures to mitigate climate change and adapt to increased sea levels. ""Climate change is affecting so many people around the world,"" said Professor Bill McKibben, director of CDRC. Now, the future of our planet is under threat from a growing range of problems but it is important we continue to focus on the real impact of climate change.

But its success was eclipsed by the reality of what it's like to live in the repressive nation. The North Korean cosmetics industry, which employs one in four of the country's people, is estimated to be worth $500bn (£377bn).

The women have been photographed by photographer Jin Young-jin for ""Beauty is Freedom,"" an exhibition of the work of the North Korean cosmetics industry, at the National Museum of Korea. The exhibition opens on 7 February. ""The beauty of the North Korean women has to be beautiful,"" says Jin. But I don't think this is a beauty issue.

629,"Billionaire bunkers: How the 1% are preparing for the apocalypse Billionaire property developer Donald Trump is taking on the rich and famous with a bunker-style mansion in New Jersey. Mr Trump bought the mansion for $1.92m. The mansion, which sits on nine acres in New Jersey's exclusive Point Pleasant peninsula, is due to open to the public next week. Inside, the property sees a total of 13 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms, including a swimming pool, a gymnasium and an infinity pool. The property also has a tennis court, barbecue, and an elevator. The property, which has since been sold, was originally built by billionaire oil tycoon Jay Melrose and his wife in the 1930s. He was later described by the BBC as ""perhaps the richest American man of all time"" and ""one of the most successful billionaire businessmen of all time."" The mansion is expected to prove difficult for Mr Trump's family. The President's eldest daughter Ivanka Trump, who has been living at the property, is understood to be moving out. The couple have four children, including two with Mr Melrose. A spokesman for the property said: ""The mansion is likely to be a big attraction. It has everything you need for a luxury private residence. It is going to be much smaller than the average mansion. The mansion is estimated to be worth between $10m and $15m. But Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, is said to be determined to avoid the property's current owner after she bought the property for $1.99m in 2013. If they continue to sell the property, then the President's children, Donald Jr, Eric, Ivanka and their husband Jared Kushner, are likely to stay put. They live off-site, and there are fears the land could be converted into homes. The estate is currently being used as a"" holiday cottage, ""yet rumours circulated that Donald Trump could move in. One report suggested he had plans to sell the property. The president has never owned a property in the US, and his company has no intention of selling it. At the time of his property purchase, Mr Trump's company, Trump Hotels, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company went into liquidation in November 2012 but restructured its debts before being sold to its creditors. The property, which has been rented out for an estimated $15m, is"

The supermodel, 47, was seen arriving at JFK airport on Saturday wearing a long-sleeved yellow wool coat and black dress pants. She wore a large black hat tied to her hair and sported a large red earring. The star added black sandal-style boots and a black and gold choker necklace. The New York native wore her long, dark hair down and sported sunglasses as she made her way through the terminal. Campbell had been traveling in Europe and was in New York to attend the launch of her memoir, ""Never Say Never."" The catwalk queen, a mother of two, has been a vocal advocate for the # MeToo and Time's Up movements. She also has an estimated net worth of $60 million. Campbell is the latest celebrity to have been infected with the virus, which has infected more than 350 people in 69 countries. She was previously one of the stars who was hospitalized for 14 days last year. In late September, Campbell canceled an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to deal with the outbreak. The ""What's Up"" singer-actress, who has been active in the # MeToo movement, was scheduled to appear on her talk show on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. Campbell said that she was still struggling with the illness and would be off her ""Ellen"" show on Sept. 17 for the remainder of the year. ""It's going to be a sore head for me,"" she told DeGeneres, who noted that she was ""very, very, very tired"" after a tough week for her because of the illness. For a lot of the time I was still feeling tired. I know I've got a lot of work to do, but I'm going to try to be a good example for others who are feeling like this, ""she said. The actress, who has been an avid supporter of the # MeToo movement, also encouraged followers to donate to organizations that provide clean water, sanitation and other services to people who have been affected by the outbreak. The disease has been in Africa since 1976 and the number of confirmed cases has climbed to more than 700. The Mers outbreak is ongoing in 32 countries and there are more than 3,800 confirmed."

In its last report on August 22nd, the World Health Organisation said that the Maldives was among the countries most affected by the virus. ""There are currently 17 confirmed cases of Ebola and eight patients have recovered,"" the WHO said in a statement. Four cases have been confirmed and another four are reported to be under investigation. The Maldives government said that it was not aware of any further cases in the country. The British man who was diagnosed with the virus in the Maldives has been flown from a hospital in Britain to Britain for tests to establish the cause of his illness. The Department for International Development said in a statement that it was working closely with the Maldives government and health authorities on measures to protect the country and its residents. The department said it was working in partnership with its Maldivian counterparts to monitor the situation, and that it had ""robust arrangements"" in place to limit the risk of infection. ""The UK government stands ready to provide all appropriate support to the Maldivian authorities in their response to this incident,"" it said. In a statement, the Maldives government said that a British man had been diagnosed with Ebola on Tuesday in Male, on the country's east coast. The man had recently returned from the country. The man had been in contact with his family, both in the UK and abroad, about three weeks ago and was ""well enough to go home,"" the statement said. The Maldives was the first nation to detect the virus after a man from Sierra Leone died in an outbreak at a hotel in the capital, Male, in September only three weeks after returning from his third trip to the country. The country has since been closed to visitors and business. Related: Maldives says it will reopen for tourists: 'We are reviewing the situation'.

Picture: David Clark Source: News Limited RACING cruise ship passengers say they are ""heartbroken"" that the last man standing on the ship refused to give up the fight against the deadly virus. The last man who went on the cruise was aboard a P & O cruise liner that docked in Melbourne on Tuesday morning, but the ship's owner was forced to divert the ship when he refused to leave the ship. Passengers took to social media this week to voice their displeasure at the end of a long, productive holiday. Passenger James Smith said the family of a passenger on the cruise, who did not know the man, were flying out of Melbourne this week. ""I want to see the man who did that because he was in sick and wasn't going to give up,"" Mr Smith told 3AW on Wednesday. He was a big guy and he made a lot of people happy. P & O said in a statement the ship was diverted to Melbourne and the man is now refusing to leave the ship. ""Customers are advised to look after their personal hygiene,"" the cruise line said. Passengers will be provided with advice on what to do if they have flu-like symptoms on board, and will be offered a refund should they wish to continue the trip.

633,"The tourism legacy of the Olympic Games could be threatened if efforts to revamp the city's transport, housing and tourism infrastructure fail, the report says. The UK's airports, railway stations and airports have seen their share of debris fall from the sky in the past. In 2009, the UK's biggest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick, were placed in special measures due to structural damage caused by the construction of the huge new Olympic Stadium. The report states that Heathrow's operations have also been affected by more than £20m worth of debris - the equivalent of 20 London bus seats - which has fallen from the sky during the Olympics. ""The likelihood of a plane crashing in Heathrow is now greater than it has been for years,"" the report points out. The report recommends the Government ""reduce the amount of debris from aircraft that travel over London throughout 2012."" It adds: ""Heathrow cannot continue to claim to be the global centre on debris and other potentially damaging material from aircraft that fly over London during the Olympic Games."" Heathrow is also being hit by more than £1bn of debt, the report says, with the deficit expected to hit £3.13bn by 2013-14. The report states: ""Britain has to be strategic about its place as the world's leading international airport, and it is vital that this is achieved."" But Tim Alderslade, director of the British Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said: ""As the report draws attention to Heathrow's massive debt, the Government must consider the damage to the UK economy, as well as the risks to London's reputation in the global aviation arena, and how it can develop an air transport infrastructure that will help revitalize the UK's global competitiveness."" The International Air Transport Association estimates that by 2025, 65% of the world's flying will be on air routes, but a third of all flights will be by air. As airports make the most of the best opportunities provided by airport capacity, the report says they should look overseas for new and lucrative markets. It adds: ""If London's prospects are not to hit its current share of the international air traffic market, it may have to look to other global destinations for investment, including Japan, South Korea and China."" The International Air Transport Association says that the UK's airports generate £18bn of economic activity each year. It says that one in five flights land at London's airport - a figure that is expected to rise steadily."

635,"Video shows a man rescuing neighbor's dog after its leash got stuck in elevator doors. Police said they would not release more information about the incident, but issued a statement saying the man ""used the noose to prevent the dog's owner from exiting the elevator."" In a statement, police said the incident occurred around 11: 30 p.m. Sunday in the 4800 block of Chestnut Road, Woodridge. According to police, the man was not home when it happened, but he had already left the elevator door unlocked before he got inside. The dog's owner told police that the pup, named Matilda, had been in the elevator in the elevator's sixth floor and got stuck after the door was closed. On the video, the dog is seen running towards her owner's arms. The dog's owner, who has not been identified, said she climbed out of the elevator to prevent Matilda from getting out, but the dog never came back. Police said they would not release further details about the incident. The owner said that Matilda eventually ended up being taken to a child care agency where she had been for a few hours. Police said about 15 firefighters responded to the incident, which is being investigated as an animal cruelty case. In a second video, people can be heard hearing sirens in the elevator shortly before the incident. The video shows a man and woman running up the stairs, apparently to clear a path for the dog. A woman can be heard saying, ""Matilda's here."" According to police, the woman's dog was in the elevator's sixth floor and got stuck there. ""She was able to jump out of the elevator and out the door as the dog's owner used the rope to stop the dog from escaping from the elevator,"" police said in a press release. The dog had been left in the elevator while the owner went to the hospital for treatment, police said. It was not immediately clear whether the dog, who had been in the apartment for several hours, was reunited with its owner. Police said they were aware of the incident and would work with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to investigate the matter. Click for more from Fox 32.

637,"How this outbreak is adding to the risk of miscalculation between global enemies has also become more critical to Israeli officials. Though this has not caused the disease, it has highlighted the limits of trust between the West Bank and Israel, in the strongest public denunciation yet of Israeli settlements. ""This is a major deal,"" said Shlomo Brom, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States and an expert on Middle East security. We're looking at the growing evidence that this war is escalating. This is not just a matter of the government of Israel, but Israel itself. It affects every part of the Israeli population. No one is safe from this war. What is more, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has so far resisted a deal that would allow him to stay in power indefinitely. The Obama administration, and some lawmakers in the United States, are furious that he has taken a softer line than in the past. ""If Mr. Abbas is going to continue in power even if the deal is broken, he will have to do more to lead the Palestinians toward their own state,"" Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said in a statement last week. He said the Bush administration had ""refused to engage"" with Mr. Abbas in a bid to weaken Hamas. On Thursday, the White House insisted that it had been ""prepared to work with all parties"" to resolve the conflict between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. Abbas officials said at a recent meeting with Israeli officials that they would not accept a deal that would involve Israel giving up control of East Jerusalem, a disputed area that is home to many Palestinian Christians. Nevertheless, a senior Israeli official said that it was clear that some in the American administration felt that the Palestinians had an interest in protecting their territories. ""The president's advisers see that as a positive step,"" the official said, speaking anonymously because he was not authorized to speak publicly. We see the Americans as an important partner, and we think that is a positive step. Michael R. Gordon reported from Washington, and Hania Mourtada from Jerusalem.

In all, more than 1,000 people died in the aftermath of the Typhoon Haiyan. Although there were many cases of the illness in the Philippines in 2013, it has disappeared. The World Health Organization said that of the 1.2 million cases it had examined from that time, only 3,951 were confirmed as the virus and 2,170 of them were children. In all, more than 3,300 people died across the globe from the new swine flu outbreak in Mexico. In the U.S. the actual death rate is probably less than 1 percent. This week, doctors in the United States announced that the swine flu virus had returned to the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning that it could increase in severity and become more deadly over the next two to three weeks. Here are some pictures from the time when the virus was seen in the United States. Two U.S. Air Force F-16C Hornets are in the Middle East with help from the USAF. This week, the United Nations said that the ongoing outbreak in West Africa has worsened. In the Philippines, the World Health Organization said that the current outbreak of the virus has left many of the country's 21,000 people dead. A recent WHO assessment said that the new flu virus has no vaccine or cure. And what exactly does the World Health Organization intend to do to help? The WHO has already established a vaccine production facility in Mexico, and the organisation has said that it will be moving ahead with its plans to move through the country during the coming weeks.

640,"What you need to know about coronavirus on Friday, March 13 Australia - WHO has confirmed a new strain of the coronavirus that can cause severe illness in pigs, and Australia's health minister has warned pig farmers not to let sick farmers off the hook. ""This is a serious disease, particularly if it's spread in the general public, and if this outbreak reaches the general population, there will be a significant impact on both the farming and tourism sectors,"" Bill Shorten said in a statement. The World Organization for Animal Health's latest update to its global animal health watch list, due out on Monday, said it does not consider the new strain of the virus to be a threat to humans, but that it needed to be carefully identified and treated. Experts say the virus's rapid spread in pig farms in the US and Canada is still a concern. That's because the virus has made its way into pigs and is not known to affect humans. Coronaviruses occur in pigs, but their antibodies can only get into pigs if they come in contact with infected animals, often via saliva or saliva. The World Health Organization says it cannot confirm or comment on the exact nature of the outbreak. Coronaviruses can spread easily from person to person. They can be spread through contact with contaminated food or water or by direct contact with an infected person's nose, or in the throat, which carries the virus's own unique antigen. A WHO statement said it was ""working with the international microbial community to create a process for managing the spread of the virus and the prevention of transmission to humans."" ""At this stage there is no evidence to suggest that the virus can be transmitted from person to person by pigs, but it is being kept under close surveillance,"" the statement said. Coronaviruses are the second most common cause of bacterial infections in the world after swine flu, according to the WHO. Australia last month became the first country to declare itself free of the virus after a fresh case of the respiratory illness, and vaccinations were also in place across the country. In Australia, a total of 113 recorded cases of the illness have been reported, the majority of them in the southeastern state of Queensland. The state health department has advised anyone who is ill to stay away from pigs and pig carcasses for a period of time"

Speaking at the CIA's annual conference in Washington, CIA Director General John Brennan said that ""things are about to change"" in Washington. Brennan said that the US ""just doesn't have the leverage that we need to be the world's leading power."" ""I think it's pretty clear that things are about to change,"" Brennan said. Everything is about to change, and it will happen in a few short years, when people start calling on it and I think it's very possible that the United States will be able to pull itself out of the economic woes we are in. So I think that's a very significant time. Brennan said that ""the main risk we face right now is the attack on our own defenses."" He said that ""I think the biggest thing that people need to understand is that we have to be able to defend ourselves, and that we have to go about our business with the same strong commitment to our homeland."" He went on to say that ""the American people need a president who can take the fight to the enemy, and who can confront the enemy if it suits us, and have them be prepared to take on the Islamic State."" Brennan's comments came after Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump engaged in a ""very amicable"" telephone call. Putin and Trump also agreed to work together on the ""protection of Russian democratic institutions,"" the Kremlin said. ""Putin said that he and Trump agreed on the necessity for a new form of cooperation between the two countries in order to defend the interests of the state of law and order in the region and in the world,"" it added. The Kremlin and the Central Election Commission (CEC) confirmed that the telephone call took place the day after Putin and Trump spoke at the G7 Summit in Italy. The call was initiated by the US president and his Russian counterpart, Abe. The two leaders agreed to work together to maintain peace in the region. As part of this agreement, Putin and Trump agreed the need to enhance their military cooperation in the event of war, according to a Kremlin statement. Putin and Trump agreed to establish a joint working group to develop the necessary mechanisms to fulfill the Russian side's interests."

We are currently investigating the cause of this outbreak and if anyone has symptoms they should contact a GP or NHS Direct for advice. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: ""The safety of our patients is our priority and we are working closely with local authorities and other stakeholders.

644,"Cubans are making coronavirus masks from pants material The most likely method of transmission is through contaminated water or meat, or through contact with infected animals or contaminated birds. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says there are more than 8,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of the virus globally each year. In the last three years, there have been over 15,000 laboratory-confirmed cases in the United States. Researchers are working to develop new methods to combat the virus, including cleaning surfaces, removing fluids and sealing off carpets. ""At this time of year, coronavirus infections can be particularly serious,"" said Dr. Joseph Romero, professor of infectious diseases at the University of California, Davis. Although coronavirus infections are rare, there are several strains circulating that are spread by direct contact with infected animals. Researchers are trying to determine how bacteria build up in the blood stream to become coronavirus, which can cause severe illness, such as pneumonia. ""We are trying to identify which strains we can target,"" said Romero. We are trying to understand the process of transmission and develop a synthesis of what we know about how these bacteria behave and how it can become transmitted. Researchers are using the technique to figure out how to make the product more elastic before any of these strains can get into the human bloodstream. ""We are trying to make these products more elastic, so that if you get bacterial transmission, you get the flu,"" said Romero. There are approximately 10 million cases of Zika virus globally each year, according to the CDC. The disease is transmitted through mosquitoes, which are known to transmit the virus. The virus is carried in the air by coronaviruses such as Zika, and people with symptoms should protect themselves from mosquito bites, especially pregnant women, the CDC said. ""It's important that people and their healthcare workers recognize the symptoms of the virus until the symptoms begin,"" Romero said. But to prevent the infection, it's also important to be aware of all possible sources of infection. ""It is a simple, simple way to prevent the transmission of influenza,"" he said. We have to find out which way the virus is travelling. The CDC's Zika Center is conducting a study on the"
645,"How religious communities are modifying traditions to prevent coronavirus spread. A study that analyzed religious and ethical practices found that ""those who think of themselves as Christians are not doing so because they are concerned about the spread of the disease,"" said study author Sathyanarayan S. Rao, Ph.D., assistant professor of kinesiology and biostatistics at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia. Instead, Rao suggested that religious communities modify their practices to avoid the spread of the virus. ""Many Christians believe that if they are ill, they should be treated with a more forgiving and gentle approach towards them,"" Rao said in a press release. This approach can help the vulnerable and prevent the spread of infection. Religious communities have evolved to recognize that coronaviruses can infect any living person, regardless of their ethical beliefs. We found that the coronavirus is not infecting anybody, but instead the disease is being used by people who feel unsafe or unwelcoming at their own community sites. This new study, which is published in the Journal of Urban Health, urges the community to change their practices to avoid the spread of the disease. ""A coronavirus infection can be devastating to individuals and communities,"" said study co-author Daniel Zamudio, Ph.D., assistant professor of kinesiology and biostatistics at the Mailman School of Public Health. We encourage the public to take preventative measures when they are visiting places and communities where they might have unprotected sex. SOURCE: Journal of Urban Health, online April 24, 2010.

646,"Children displaced in the Boko Haram conflict are on a path to success thanks to a school prioritizing peace and development, according to research published Monday in the journal Science. The new report by the University of Sussex and the University of Zambia surveyed more than 100 students and members of the youth and community groups set up by the United Nations to address the issue of conflict. The research focused on the emergence of a school for all children displaced by Boko Haram and its associated terrorist organizations. It also examined the effects of conflict in the area, including the impact of international pressure. ""We found that peace and development were the main motivating factors for displacement, and the school was a good fit for the purpose,"" said researcher Maryam Shamam of Sussex and the University of Zambia. The researchers tested 60 of the students, and they are investigating whether more pupils might be encouraged to enrol in the school. They also found that displacement has a ""positive impact"" on students' well-being, and that the children are more likely to stay in schools after graduation than leave. Although Boko Haram began its insurgency in northeast Nigeria last year, it has now spread to Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Nigeria, Benin, Cameroon and Chad. But, the report said the Islamic group's gains have been slowed by the Nigerian government's failure to improve its security forces. The study also found that education and health services have struggled to survive. ""The schools and clinics are often full and the clinics are severely understaffed,"" said Shamam. If we were to look at the actual needs of the displaced population, it would be that it was a very hard tragedy, but it was an immensely complex situation, and the education sector would have to respond. For more on the report from the University of Sussex, visit Science. Jonathan Kaiman, a senior researcher at the University of Zambia, said the study ""highlights the importance of reconciliation in the fight against Boko Haram."" ""The challenge that awaits the region is to establish effective governance,"" Kaiman told Reuters. The rebuilding of schools and health services is an important issue for the region. And with these new findings, the global community is fully committed to support the rebuilding process. More information on the study can be found here.

647,"Italy is a test of how a Western economy bear an almost-total shutdown, where private investors scramble to protect their capital. Its economic problems have forced the European Central Bank to cut interest rates and other measures to help shore up the bloc's shaky banks. But with Europe's economic health already weakening, investors are wary. ""The risk is that the downturn will be felt most fiercely in Italy,"" said Carlo Padoan, an economist at BNP Paribas in Rome. While Italy will have to deal with the problems, the country's economic problems are likely to linger for several months, he said. The European Central Bank, which controls the lending rate at the euro zone's financial system, has little room for error, economists say. The bank's governing council, the bank's executive board, will meet Thursday to decide whether to cut its benchmark interest rate next month. The decision is crucial because the bank's refinancing effort would be a huge help to euro zone banks, analysts said. But it would also push up borrowing costs for those banks that have seen their borrowing costs rise. Analysts have estimated that the banks could be at risk of losses of as much as €100 billion. For its part, the euro zone's largest economy has benefited from the uncertainty created by the Greek bailout. But Italy is at a delicate point, as it has in the past. Last year, the country's economy was dragged back into recession by the global financial crisis. The latest austerity drive, which includes substantial cuts in public spending, is expected to cost the government about €10 billion - a figure that is already higher than Greece's. The cost of restructuring the banks is also expected to exceed the amount slashed to Greece's first bailout in 2010 when the country's economic problems worsened amid the unfolding crisis. In a sign that the country is in dire need of help, the country's bank regulators have blocked the resumption of payments to investors tied to the sale of state assets. The European Central Bank, meanwhile, has been trying to help Greece through its bailout, but has so far refused to allow Greece to repay its debts. In a letter to the European Union, the European Commission said that would force Greece to keep its aid program and its $1.8 billion bailout package until the end of the month. It said that in the absence of a Greek bailout agreement, the E.C.B. needed to intervene in the market."

The state prosecutor's office said Thursday that a French man, a woman, a man and a woman who worked with the fake agency were each sentenced to six and eight years. The fake agency, Constructiv, was based in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis and advertised jobs in Paris and other French cities. The agency was set up as an online recruitment agency, selling mostly vacant office spaces on the black market. It was revealed in a court hearing last year that the agency cost the government more than 500,000 euros ($600,000) in advertising revenue. The ministry has said it will appeal the sentences.

651,"Mars rover expected to launch this year delayed until 2022, partially due to coronavirus Curiosity rover hit two problems during its mission in 2012: It found a rock that might not have been habitable and it damaged its robotic arm, which was supposed to drill a six-inch-wide rock and test the rovers for signs of life. The rover's first test came in 2011, when it found a ""very old rock"" in the middle of its Martian rover, according to the mission's website. But it then moved the rover closer to the rock, where it had drilled the hole to find the presence of methane gas, which is a key ingredient for life. The rover has been running at a high rate of speed since it arrived in Mars in 2012. It is expected to blast off in December of 2016. The Mars 2020 rover, which launched in 2004 and is intended to return to Mars in 2022, is designed to study the Martian environment and explore the history of microbial life. The rover hopes to look for evidence of water on Mars, and it will seek any signs of life there. But since landing on Mars, the rover has been unable to detect life. The Mars 2020 rover was designed to dig up samples from ancient regions in order to find organic molecules that might have been present on the planet. NASA has repeatedly attempted to send rovers on the red planet to explore Mars, but it has encountered a series of problems in recent years.

652,"Ireland closes schools and colleges to halt coronavirus spread Fri Jun 3, 2014 7: 17pm EDT (Reuters) - Ireland on Friday closed schools and colleges and implemented a nationwide hand-washing policy for people returning to work, fearing that a tightened border along the border with the United Kingdom, a disease linked to a British bout of coronavirus, was to blame for a decline in cases of the respiratory disease. The National Health Service said it was working with health officials to prevent the spread of the illness, which causes coughs and sneezes and is spread by contact with infected objects from infected people. It said the risk of infection in the presence of the virus remained low. Ireland's public health agency, the National Vaccine Agency, said the first reported case of the disease had happened in a school in the eastern coastal city of Cork. It said the school had been closed to new admissions for the next 14 days while officials investigated the case and had asked for people who visit the school to remain at home during the rest of the week to wash their hands. Ireland is the first country in the world to report a case of the bout of coronavirus, which has killed around 1,200 people in Europe so far this year. The infection is spread by animals such as birds and mosquitos.

653,"What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, March 12, 2018 10: 29 AM We're not entirely sure what the virus poses to the body after exposure, but it can affect the outer layer of the skin. And it can be spread by touching someone who is dirty or when someone is coughing. To get it to spread, you've got to pass it through a person's nose, through your mouth, or through contaminated surfaces. Those are all possible sources, but there are a number of vaccines and medications available for preventing coronavirus. I'm taking a look at some of the vaccines we're using (and, yes, some more are on the market) to keep you up to date. Here are some possible vaccines to avoid: One of the best ways to prevent coronavirus now is to cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Cough and sneeze together Make sure your hands and other surfaces are clean and that your eyes are clean and dry. Use two hand sanitizer wipes when you cough or sneeze to disinfect your hands, and use a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Use a disposable contact lens or toothbrush when you cough or sneeze. As for why you might not be interested in having a vaccine, if you are, you can tell us about it here. A nasal spray and a nasal spray will be effective. Use a flu shot to protect you against the flu. Wear a condom when you cough or sneeze. If you've been in contact with someone with the virus, call 911 immediately. If anyone thinks they may have the flu, contact your health care provider so they can treat you. If the person has flu symptoms, they should contact their health care provider or local health department. It's important to remember that this is a serious virus and it's more likely to spread through the environment than through simple contact, such as coughing or sneezing. People with the flu should keep up the good fight, even if you have less protection than usual. Read more about the flu here. What will the World Health Organization do to combat the global flu?

The Department of Environment, Food and Rural affairs is looking at a ban on roaming in some parts of the UK, although the UK's Crown Estate is looking at using a new one in the Highlands. So is the National Trust. Why can't it just find somewhere else to roam and explore without all the hassle? And what of the many other rogue, incompetent or dangerous activities that are the responsibility of the authorities? Why isn't the police or council, when they could be just as competent and disciplined as they are now, looking after our wildlife? That is the only way to truly make this situation safe. A spokesman for the Crown Estate said: ""The Crown Estate is committed to protecting and enhancing the beautiful and heritage environment of the Highlands and Islands. The Crown Estate operates the largest and most extensive natural heritage estate in the UK and is passionate about conservation. The Crown Estate has always been committed to the natural heritage of the Highlands and Islands as well as the protection of wildlife habitats. We will continue to work with our partners, including the National Trust, to explore a range of options to enhance protected areas where we can contribute to the local economy. We have therefore decided to commission independent research with representatives from Natural England. All interested parties will have the opportunity to respond through the consultation process. We have a duty to protect, enhance and conserve the environment of the Highlands and Islands. We will also work to minimise the effects on wildlife and natural heritage sites within the wider landscape. We have been working closely with Natural England on the review. I would like to commend their efforts in understanding the issues raised. There were many, many issues to resolve and this is one of them. We will continue to work with Natural England to achieve a better balance between protecting wildlife and the interests of those who live in the Highlands and Islands. So will the authorities, and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds? Perhaps they will. But whatever the outcome of the review, we can all hope to see more wild, inexperienced and unpredictable species on the horizon.

It's an endless vista, with a vista of forest and rolling hills that make up the state's landscape. It's a quiet, rural landscape that, like the rest of the country, has been in the news recently. The latest numbers are not encouraging. The state's unemployment rate, at 3.4% last month, is the lowest in the nation. And even though the economic crisis has diminished, the situation may not get better. The last time Iowa experienced the same level of joblessness was when the federal government was in full force - until the Great Recession. Now, Ixtapa has 3.2 million people. The state's unemployment rate is about the same as in California. However, it's higher than in Wisconsin, at 7.9%. As a result, Ixtapa is a prime spot for those seeking a new outlook. Jodi Shacknai tells CNN about her new life in rural Iowa. I'm 25 years old. My friends and family have been here for 40 or 50 years now, and they're not getting that. So I feel like I'm a kid now. I got a job when I was 20 and I'm learning to farm and not to do anything else, ""she says. Every month I get a call from a friend who is a farmer somewhere in Iowa. He says, 'Tell me about this?' And I say, 'Mom, I'm 25, I'm not going to farm.' Shacknai says she's still learning about the land and land around her, but she has no intention of moving to Iowa. I just like to travel. I don't like to go to places like Iowa,"" she says. You can't walk down the street and just walk past somebody and get that feeling of somebody in the middle of something. The situation could have been even worse. The state's unemployment rate is the lowest in the country. That's because it's not as bad as it used to be. More than half of the state's population lives below the poverty line. But the rural areas have been getting better, and the rural areas are doing better. ""You can see the change happening -- the difference is not in the rural areas, but in the city,"" says Shacknai. We're on the right track."

The virus, which causes the common cold to be worse, is just as dangerous as normal cold-like symptoms, says the chief medical officer of the Australian government. The viral disease can also cause the respiratory system to become extremely susceptible to infection and can be carried by coughs, sneezes, or even a cold-like cough. The Australian government has declared a public health emergency for the country, warning people to hand their tissues out to children and others who have come into contact with people who may have been exposed. ""Given the seriousness of this virus and its potential for spread, there is a high possibility that there will be significant cases,"" Dr Vicky Sheppeard said on Thursday. People should also carry their health-protective clothing to a doctor's office if they are feeling unwell.

After being involved with the NHL for over 30 years, NBA Commissioner David Stern (left) and Commissioner Adam Silver (center) attend a news conference in the New York City borough of New York on January 22, 2015. Stern first retired after the 1997-98 season and was hired by the league as executive vice president in 2004. NBA Commissioner David Stern announced his retirement from the NBA in July 2013. The league was forced into a shutdown on Friday when the owners of the New York Knicks and the New York Nets failed to come to an agreement over a massive $2 billion plan to move to Madison Square Garden. Stern, who received an estimated $1 billion a year, was paid $1 million for the job and was re-hired by New York in September 2013. Under the current plan, which was set to expire at the end of the season, the Knicks would be moved to Madison Square Garden in 2019. Under the new arrangement, the Knicks would be moved to New York in 2020, and the Nets would be moved in 2021. Stern has been in a relationship with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver since 2009. According to the New York Daily News, Stern called Silver before the recent deal was reached and said that Silver ""could be a good friend of mine and we could make a good deal."" Stern also praised the Nets ""owner, who reportedly asked for $1 billion a year."" The Nets and Mark Cuban are great friends, ""Stern said. It's like we're brothers. Stern has had a long relationship with the NBA, having previously worked as the chairman of the N.B.A."" s Board of Governors and as the president and CEO of the NBA Development League, and also has been the chairman of the NBA Players Association. During his tenure as NBA commissioner, Stern has reached agreements with the players union and worked with the Nets and the Knicks. ""I am proud to have been a part of these teams, and I firmly believe that will continue to be true with the NBA,"" Stern said. The Nets declined to comment on Stern's retirement. In August, Stern was named chairman of the NBA Development League, an independent organization that commits to developing the business and coaching careers of the NBA's players. He is also a member of the NBA's Basketball Operations Committee and has a personal stake in the league. CNBC's Mike Sheetz contributed to this report."

But the experience of his first three years of being vice president has been a different story. He's seen how the crisis in Japan, the European debt crisis and a federal government shutdown have left him in better shape than he was a year ago. And the vice president has used the experience of his first year in office to help shape U.S. policies in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in the United States. ""It's a very difficult time, but we've been through it as a country,"" Biden told the American Enterprise Institute recently. He says he's confident the country will be able to deal with the aftermath of the challenges. ""We've got a lot of people who have been through the same thing,"" he said. And we never got into the same place. Biden has also gone after the president's health-care plan, and he's been critical of the president's effort to repeal and replace the 2010 health-care law. ""They're trying to run around saying that it's a bad way to do things,"" said Biden. But I think it's a lot better than that. And Biden's willingness to take on the president -- and the challenges facing America -- has never been more evident, especially since his second term began. But the vice president has already shown his political skills in the White House, and in dealing with the unfolding crisis in the Middle East, where Syria is increasingly being portrayed as an existential threat. And he's been a forceful advocate for the president's health-care reform law. The president's health care law was enacted amid the national uproar over the administration's handling of the crisis. In addition to his health care law, the president brought up the Affordable Care Act in his speech. ""The battle over health care is not over and we are not going back to Washington,"" Biden said Tuesday. But we are going back to the same old, same old.

""We are spending time and money trying to prevent this that we don't know how to prevent,"" said Dr. David Acheson, a CDC epidemiologist. He joins ""CBS This Morning"" to discuss how to avoid the deadly virus, and what prevention tools can be put in place to help prevent spread. Are you at risk for developing a coronavirus? What steps should you take to prevent a bout of coronavirus? Coronaviruses are most often found in warm, humid climates. They can spread from person to person, and are more deadly than many infections. Symptoms include fever, chills, cough, runny nose, sore throat, headache, fatigue, muscle aches and fatigue. Some people have serious cognitive disabilities or neurological problems that affect their ability to work, school and engage in daily activities. They can be spread by contact with an infected person, touching contaminated objects, touching contaminated equipment and touching contaminated surfaces, among other things. In most cases, people recover within a few days. ""For many people, it's an awful thought to think that you can't be saved,"" Acheson said. The CDC recommends that you wash your hands, avoid sharing food or drink and frequent hand-washing. For those who are at risk for developing a coronavirus, do not let the virus contaminate your hands. ""If you're getting sick from a common cold, you should wash your hands with soap and water, use your hands frequently, and try to avoid touching contaminated objects, including surfaces, by using soap and water,"" Acheson said. If you find a person with a common cold, or who is at risk for developing a coronavirus, you should seek medical attention. If you develop a respiratory infection from a virus you're handling, call your health care provider immediately to talk with a doctor or doctor.

660,"It's time to let the experts do their jobs, Mr. President. That's what the Senate is going to do. That's what the House is going to do. A compromise measure by Boehner, however, would have cut about $310 billion from current spending over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It also would have put the economy on a path toward full employment. ""Congress must look the American people in the eye and say, 'let's do this,'"" Boehner said. The House is expected to act quickly, with no more debate expected on the proposal until the Dec. 15 recess. The Senate is also expected to vote on the proposal early next week. The Obama administration has been counting on it to help attract more foreign investment and promote U.S. exports overseas. Top House Republicans have said they would veto any spending bill that includes an increase in the debt limit before the debt ceiling is raised. But on Friday, Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid signaled that they would not bring a spending bill to the Senate floor until they could make progress on the debt ceiling. ""The Senate remains committed to trying to increase the debt limit,"" Reid said Friday, according to the Hill. We're not going to shut down the government until we get a better deal than this one. Reid, R-Nev., said ""a deal to keep the government open through the end of the month was not possible."" It is possible that Boehner could not get a full measure of the Senate's support for raising the debt limit. The House was expected to take up its measure this week.

661,"President Trump, heed these five lessons from my career in disaster response. His response was a warning to the rest of the world: You can't keep swinging a baby at the first sign of trouble. He did just that. And he did a pretty good job of it. We're going to have a nice, long weekend. I hope your guests will enjoy it, too. You will need a little bit of the spirit and a little bit of the expertise you will need to see the entire country. Coming off of your annual meeting at Mar-a-Lago, you should not expect the same level of care from the president and his senior staff. This goes for both the press and the president himself, and you need to be careful not to let your surroundings, too. But you also need to be careful to avoid taking on too much of the criticism that you submit to Trump. I hope that you enjoy it. Let's hope so. You are the one in the White House who has to manage the most complex and emotionally charged public relations process possible. It is the role of your family and your staff to be the one to administer the best possible service to the president, and to hold him accountable when necessary. If the press is in a holding pattern, you must stay strong and stick to your plan. The president has already made promises before, and they will be delivered. But the other side of that coin is a president who believes that it is necessary to unnecessarily take on more responsibility and to avoid putting himself at the center of the story. If you have a bad day, you must unnecessarily take on more responsibility and to avoid being questioned by the press, especially if it is a sensitive issue. If you are a leader, you need to be a leader. You know, you need to think about what you are saying. Or at least what you think. In your defense of Trump, you should be a leader. You can't change the world. You just need to be a leader. If you take on more responsibility, you will get the best people you can. And you will be able to lead it. But you can't take it on full throttle. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Susan Borodullo.

662,"A prison pandemic? Steps to avoid the worst Sikh separatist group One of the world's biggest Sikh separatist groups today said it will increase the number of Muslim prisoners in Britain and the US as it expands its activities in the West following the killing of an Indian security guard during a gun attack on an Sikh temple in China. Singh Gohil Singh, a prominent Sikh lawyer, said the group, the Sikh Warriors Association, would increase the number of Muslim prisoners it holds in Britain and the US to 500 in the future. Gohil Singh, a prominent Sikh lawyer, said that the group, which is based in Amritsar, India, plans to increase the number of Muslim prisoners it holds in Britain and the US to 500 in the future He said: ""As the chief of the Sikh community, I do not want to see others join in the Sikh struggle and for that I am sorry."" I am not the Sikh, and I believe in the Sikh faith. I want to see more people from my community join the struggle for justice, ""he told the Times Higher Education Supplement. Singh, who has been the target of the hardline Sikh group, said that he had been given a chance to escape as a member of the Sikh community by his father after he was arrested for carrying a knife. His uncle, an official in the Indian Home Ministry, told the Times Higher Education Supplement that Singh's father had agreed to grant him permission to leave the country. His father had been told that the Sikh community was being targeted while he was in jail."" This was a big shock, ""said the official. The man said that his father had been released from prison and that his wife had given permission for her husband to leave the country. Gohil Singh said that the Sikh community had a"" moral obligation ""to fight against the threat of terrorism in the West. Sikhs in Britain, like many other faiths, have been targeted for terrorism attacks by Sikh extremists, with attacks on mosques and soldiers in recent years. In December 2006, a suicide bomber set off explosives outside a Sikh temple in Manchester. He was later sentenced to death. A Sikh man who was also convicted of killing an Indian security guard in January 2006 was released from prison."
663,"Nordic Prime Ministers: We are committed to protecting women's rights, say UK's leaders Prime Minister Theresa May, fresh from her UK-Norway summit, has said she is prepared to sit down with the leaders of Norway, Iceland and Denmark to discuss the rights of women and equality. The issue has been raised many times in Britain over the last four years, with MPs calling for a law protecting women's rights to be amended. It's a topic of particular concern to the prime minister, who has been asked by both women and men to take the lead in ending the ""myth"" that men have ""not got"" any more when it comes to women's politics. Speaking after her meeting with Theresa May in Downing Street, Ms May said she was committed to ensuring women's rights were protected in all parts of the UK. ""I was very clear that we are committed to ensuring women's rights are protected in all parts of our country,"" she said. This is being discussed before the next round of Commonwealth summits in the Caribbean and I hope that we can agree on a way forward that will allow us to continue to honour our international commitments, which we are obliged to do in the Commonwealth. The PM said that she wanted to end ""myths"" about women and equality, adding: ""I want us to be better than men."" The Prime Minister said that ""good progress"" was being made towards gender equality in all areas of society. She said that after a ""very exciting"" meeting in Downing Street on Saturday, her ""clear message was that we are all going to work together to ensure that women's rights are protected in all parts of the UK."" Ms May said: ""I am also grateful for the commitment that the UK is making to improving the rights of women and girls in the Commonwealth.""

Ms May travelled to Norfolk after speaking to the leaders of women's rights in the UK on Monday. She said she knew the UK and Norway - two countries ""that have a lot in common"" - would be ""very interested"" to hear what she had to say. Ms May was asked on Tuesday if she will meet with the Norwegians to discuss the issue. She said she welcomed the opportunity to express her views. ""I will certainly do that,"" Ms May said. I think that women's issues in the UK are very important."
664,"Netanyahu scrabbles his way to one of his biggest victories as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivers a speech at his headquarters in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Jan. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's unexpected victory in Israel's elections has triggered a fresh round of speculation and a new round of internal party struggles. Xinhua / Issael Gendler 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's unexpected victory in Israel's elections has prompted a fresh round of speculation and a new round of internal party struggles. Netanyahu's Likud party, which has sought to capitalize on the recent national elections with a series of policy proposals, saw a dramatic surge in its share of the vote in recent days, up to 23 percentage points to just 7 percentage points. The far-right Jewish Home, the dominant party in the parliament, was also on track to form a coalition government with the centrist Yisrael Beitenu party. The move has sparked a fresh round of internal party splits, with the party's most prominent leader Isaac Herzog openly calling for a complete split from the government. In a televised address after polls closed at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, Netanyahu said that he would form a new governing coalition with Yisrael Beitenu, Israel's main opposition party. However, the move has roiled the Israeli political establishment, with Netanyahu's new coalition with Yisrael Beitenu set to become the second-largest party in the Knesset. The new coalition will mark the longest ever governed by one party and will be launched alongside the parliamentary elections. Netanyahu has been in power since 2005. As head of the Likud, he has repeatedly sought to limit the influence of the right-wing religious party, led by ultra-Orthodox party Isaac Herzog, who has pledged to vote against any deal with the Palestinians and have urged talks. According to Israeli media reports, Netanyahu is likely to appoint an ultra-Orthodox party politician as his prime minister, a move which could mean forming a coalition government with the centrist Yisrael Beitenu. The new coalition is expected to be announced by the end of the week, with two contenders expected to be announced by prime minister Netanyahu's office on Tuesday. The Likud party has so far not said who will be in the coalition. But several commentators have suggested Kadima Party leader Tzipi Livni, or lawmaker Tzipi Livni, would be a"
665,"90% of people are biased against women. That's the challenge we face when it comes to women in politics. The Liberal Democrats say they will not intervene in the selection process. In an opinion piece in The Independent, the party's general secretary, Vince Cable, said: ""As a party we believe in equal rights for all and we have a clear, robust definition of what is legal under employment law. The party will support a change to the law which allows equal access to justice for women, but is also one which places a greater value on equality and fairness. Any change to the employment law would have to be approved by Parliament before it can be implemented. In the UK, it was legal to discriminate against someone based on their sex, sex, sexuality or race. It was only in 2011 that the Equal Opportunity Bill was passed in Parliament, with a number of changes made to the law. Under the legislation, a person could only be employed if they had been assessed as having a disability that was unlawful, or who did not have a qualified disability and they had no other qualification. A bill in the House of Lords would have changed the law to also allow for discrimination on grounds of gender, sex, sexuality and disability. Labour leader Ed Miliband said:"" The Equality Act is designed to make sure that everyone gets a fair and equal chance in life in this country and the government will introduce legislation which will make sure that everyone can be a successful and work-eligible member of society. ""The prime minister, David Cameron, has said he is"" not in favour of discrimination. ""His deputy, Nick Clegg, said:"" The Equality Act is about making sure that people have a right to employment. That's why successive governments have brought in the Equality Act to create a fairer country. The Equality Act has been a huge success in lowering inequality. The gender pay gap was 10% while the gap in the earnings of men was 22%. In the same period, women earned about 64% more than men. In 2003, when the coalition government was formed, the gap was 23%. The Equality Act also enabled the government to give more power to local communities - including giving them control of areas with high levels of poverty and increasing financial support for people with disabilities. It also extended the right to flexible working to all workers and made it easier to access flexible working. The Equality Act was introduced in 2013."
666,"Opinion: The real thing holding Africa's female entrepreneurs back From the age of ten, a lot of Africa's female entrepreneurs are overdue for the next big thing. African women have traditionally experienced a lack of equality in the workplace, especially in the home, so a change in economic and political norms is going to be a major challenge for them. But there's a positive side to the story. These women often have an idea, or at least a plan to start one, and have put in a lot of hard work. It also helps to have a strong network of contacts, and when they need to push for a dream, they can start a business anywhere, anywhere. In these situations, they have a lot of knowledge and are able to take on challenges. The global financial crisis caused a worldwide contraction in the African economy in 2008, and in many African countries it is impacting on the entrepreneurial spirit. But because of the global financial crisis and the high level of female entrepreneurship in Africa, many African women are relying on a system of support. While many African countries have made progress in recent years, it's important to be careful when you talk about the black female entrepreneur. The African women's entrepreneurship is very important to them. It's like a family. When a family comes together, the family is the most important element. The African women find that the African men don't have the same opportunities. That's why some African women are starting small businesses in their home countries. They are finding different ways of working, and they are getting more money from the African government. If we want to create a business environment where the African women are healthy, we have to look for the African women as well. If we want to change the social structure of Africa, we must look for the African women's entrepreneurs, and if we want to redistribute wealth, we have to put women in their homes as well. The African women are going to have to change the social structure of Africa and work hard to redistribute wealth, but they are very good at it. We know that the African female entrepreneurs will be successful because they have a strong network of friends and mentors, and are prepared to take on challenges. They have a strong sense of ownership and self-determination and this is all important to them. They want to give back to their communities and to their country.

668,"NATO Secretary General: Why we're in Afghanistan and what a peace deal could do to help ISIS / ISIS The international community is trying to stop the ISIS threat, but not in this way. CBS News national security analyst Juan Zarate joins ""CBS This Morning"" to discuss why the international community wants to do more to stop the Islamic State terror threat. Zarate says the reason is the difficulty in getting the international community to ""get behind this idea of peace"" that is being discussed in Afghanistan. Zarate says the international community should back the Afghan government's peace process and stop the violence that has left militants under attack. ""We're in Afghanistan for eight years, and we need to get the peace process going,"" he says. We want to help the Afghan people get on with their lives. When he signed the agreement that ended the Afghan war, President Obama said he wanted to be ""a partner"" of the Afghan government and help it ""get back on track."" Zarate says if the international community doesn't get behind the Afghan government's peace process, it will be doomed to failure. Zarate says ISIL is also weakened by a lack of support from the Afghan Taliban. ""There are Afghan tribes that are resistant to ISIL,"" he says, ""and they are willing to help us."" But he says the international community should also work with the Afghan police and the country's army to train and arm them. Zarate says that's not enough to persuade the Taliban to join peace talks. ""If now you went back to the international community's advice and they didn't have direct support from Pakistan - I wouldn't think that would be a good thing in a situation like this,"" he says. But he says an international effort is needed to train and arm the Afghan security forces. We've seen a number of ISIL members have been trained by Pakistan to be trained to be on the battlefield. We need to have a more focused engagement with the Afghan people, ""he says. He says the international community should support the"" good governance ""of Afghanistan's government. Zarate says the United States and the Afghans are working together to develop the Afghan army and police. He says the U.S. is working hard to prevent a civil war, but it's a"" long, dangerous road ""and"" very difficult in the short run. ""Zarate says the fight in Afghanistan will be long and difficult.

But they also remain powerful fighters who have resorted to suicide bombings and targeted assassinations in a campaign to undermine the Kabul government and undermine the fragile peace process.

670,"Biden victories leave Sanders speechless MILWAUKEE - Vice President Joe Biden won Wisconsin Tuesday night, his first victory in a Democratic primary by a margin of more than 1,000 votes in 28 years. With more than 150 million votes cast, Biden beat the Republican candidate, Rep. Paul Ryan, by a razor-thin margin of more than 3,000 votes in a fight overshadowed by a series of recent controversies. ""I wanted to be here to celebrate with you,"" Biden said in his victory speech. And Biden's victories were a striking rebuke to Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, who is also expected to hold a rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, later on Tuesday. Trump, who has been building a political base in the Midwest, won the state by about 10,000 votes in two years ago. It was not immediately clear whether Biden would be joined in his campaign by any of his longtime rivals. ""We won Wisconsin tonight,"" Biden told reporters after the victory.... ""That means we're going to get to work tomorrow."" ""I think the people of Wisconsin, while they're celebrating the victory, have been celebrating with us and we've got to look at our future,"" said Biden, who is expected to drop out of the presidential race after next year's election. Biden's victory was a major victory for Democrats, who were hoping to seize the majority in the Senate from Republicans and keep control of the chamber for the first time in more than 40 years. In a sign of the widespread public sentiment toward the election, more than half of those voters had cast ballots by Tuesday evening. Biden's victory shook Democrats up in the House where they have been in Congress for nearly two decades, and at the same time highlighted concerns among some Democrats that the party is shifting into the unfamiliar role of governing. Democrats have said in recent weeks that they plan to try to block Trump from winning the White House, but have been careful to acknowledge that any effort to filibuster Trump's nominee will be opposed by all parties. Biden has said he will not be running for president in 2016. Before the race, Biden sought to present himself as a clear favorite to win the White House, arguing that he is best positioned to be an agent of social change and the revival of the middle class. He also had a message for Donald Trump, who was widely expected to win the Republican nomination. ""I know that Republicans will fight to defeat Judge Kavanau"
671,"In coronavirus crisis, Tom Hanks is more of a role model than Donald Trump The Hollywood actor Tom Hanks is being hailed as a role model by many, but he's also a little less known than Donald Trump - who has turned his attention to coronavirus. While others are turning their back on the movie star, including actors Justin Theroux and Ellen DeGeneres, because of the virus, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the new American president is just the latest celebrity to become the first president of the United States to suffer from the virus. Most notably, former president Bill Clinton's health scare in 1995 led to a Hollywood actor, Rita Moreno, leaving Hollywood due to the virus. ""I would say it's more of a celebrity role,"" said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, director of the FDA. One of the main reasons why he has a high profile role like this is that he has no experience in the business of medicine, so these things tend to be people in the entertainment industry, so it helps if you have a celebrity personality as opposed to something that's a business personality. If you have a celebrity personality, it's a good thing, if you're not a business person then people are going to be more likely to think you're not up to it. The two-year-old flu epidemic caused by the virus is thought to have killed more than a million people, with cases yet to be formally identified. But fear is still growing that the worst outbreak of the year could be over, with a new report claiming that the virus appears to be on the verge of being eradicated in Mexico. The WHO's latest report, ""Reducing Release of the Epidemic of the Epidemic of the Flu - 2016"" claims that the virus is now at 32.9 out of a possible 37.1, however, the likelihood remains of it receding by the end of the year. The WHO has warned that the outbreak could become a major health emergency in 2016, leading to a worsening of the situation in the affected countries. Read more: The Hollywood stars we never knew before Tom Hanks: Trump would have turned him into a role model in the film The Hollywood actor Tom Hanks has been the subject of much speculation since the public health emergency was announced, but he's not the only celebrity to have become the first president of the United States to suffer from the flu."
672,"Trump's speech won't erase his bumbling response on coronavirus The president has been repeatedly asked to reconsider his executive order to ban travel from seven mainly-Muslim countries, including Iraq, Iran, Syria and Yemen. But despite some progress, the order remains controversial, and some have been critical of Trump's responses to the virus. On Tuesday, he was asked to weigh in on the controversy in Washington. ""It's a total mess,"" the president said, when asked about the confusion. I really think it's a total mess. I really am not a fan of ISIS, I don't think ISIS is a good thing. We're trying to win the war on terrorism. This is a terrible mess. Trump also addressed the controversy on Twitter, thanking fans for their support. What a great day for the people of the United States! Thank you so much for your participation and support! ""he wrote. But some have questioned the president's executive order, which he signed last week, saying it doesn't go far enough to protect the country's citizens from the virus."" There is no need to extend the ban to countries with a history of Ebola or any other disease, ""Ali Noorani, a former director of the World Health Organization, told NBC News. The U.S. is not the only nation that could be affected by the Ebola outbreak. In New York City, several schools across the city have been closed to allow children to enter for the day.

On Friday, The New York Times published a story about travelers who experienced symptoms of the virus, including fever, vomiting and diarrhea.""

674,"Trump's coronavirus speech was a disaster, says medical expert The chief medical examiner of the US has said Donald Trump's inauguration speech proved that he is ""100 per cent"" immune to coronavirus. Dr Anne Schuchat said a second official report on Mr Trump's address to a joint session of Congress showed he was 100 per cent immune to the virus, which causes a severe illness in humans. The President, who was inaugurated on 21 January, had already been confined to his hospital bed for much of the day. He is still recovering from a severe infection, but some of his staff are due to travel to Washington for the inauguration on Friday. Dr Schuchat told the BBC that if Mr Trump had not received medical care the infection could have been fatal. She said the president's admission before the House of Representatives that he had ""multiple illnesses"" was ""a total distraction from the issues at hand."" Professor Schuchat said only one explanation for Mr Trump's failure to receive treatment for his sore throat, and a third explanation for his illness, was ""his coronavirus."" The president's public performances had been ""much worse"" than expected, she said. While some of Mr Trump's senior aides have been warned not to miss his inauguration speech, Dr Schuchat said the President's absence did not necessarily lead to a ""panic."" ""In the end, the president is immune to the virus,"" she said. So it is a little more like a panic. However, she added that many experts expect it to return with a ""minimal"" impact. It's best not to panic. The best thing to do is wait and see. The president's outbreaks were ""unprecedented,"" she said, not least ""because it's just a very rare event."" He must be careful. If he's not careful, we will have a massive outbreak, ""Dr Schuchat added. In the US, there were 20 cases of coronavirus in 2013, the most recent year for which data are available, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vast majority of the cases were in the south-east, including Florida and Texas. Experts believe the virus is spreading through the US, with travel advice urging against all but essential travel to the US from 11 January. The US has been on a two-year state of heightened vigilance about the risk of the disease."
675,"The huge divide between Biden and Sanders isn't limited to Sanders: Both candidates are already running much more aggressively against the status quo, especially on immigration and climate change. Which means that the Democratic candidate and her supporters on the left and right could be the real winners in this election. While the Democrats are still a long way from winning, the outcome of this election would have a profound impact on the direction of the country for the next decade. By contrast, the GOP would be far from winning the White House, and the Democratic Party may stand in a much stronger position if it could see itself playing a greater role in restraining the increasing diversity in our country. It could make it more difficult for the Democratic Party to push for the more inclusive policies that are needed to bring about a more peaceful world, such as immigration reform and the nuclear deal with Iran. But the real winners are those potential voters who may want to see the Democratic Party's nominee defeated by the Republican Party in 2020, especially if they're willing to take a chance on someone like Sanders. Their hope would be that he comes close to making history by winning the party's nomination. Read Next: We've got to get to the Sanders-Clinton race. And that's what we need to do. Read Next: This is what we need to do. We need to start winning. It's a winning strategy for Democrats. We need to win this election and need to win in November. Recommended is the following: Find a candidate who talks about hope and change. The Democratic Party, for its part, needs to get to the Sanders-Clinton race. We need a leader who is going to put hope into change. We need to win the next election. We need a leader with a plan for America's working families. And that's exactly what we're going to need. A leader who'll not only offer real solutions to problems, but who can win the election if the Democrats want to get things done. We need to win this election and create a more just and equitable country. Marisa Saslow is the author of, most recently, ""The Year of the Rich and Famous."" She is on Twitter @ marisa _ oslows1.

676,"What we're missing about age and the presidency is that it is a political document in which the person who ""does"" the job of the presidency is the president, not the vice president. The problem is that the vice president, who in their role as president could actually enact legislation, is not in the position to do that. We have the vice president who actually oversees that. And the vice president must act as the president. Now, if the president were to do that he would not have the legal authority to do that. So there is a real problem. There is a problem that the people we elect are not the people, and what vice presidents do I think is the best representation any president can have. But I think there's a whole bunch of things that I'd like to see a president do that are very unique. My view is that we need to change the way the presidency works. I'm a strong believer that we should have a president elected by the people, not an executive appointed by the people. I think that's a good idea. But I also think that when we're talking about the executive branch, if we want to have somebody who is considered to be a true American, that's not appropriate. And so I think that we need to have a president who has no vested interest in taking this country backward. I think we need to have a president who provides the leadership of a government that is trustworthy and has a plan that can be followed through. And as I said, I think that's what the right and responsible people want. But there are a number of issues that I think that the right and responsible people need to be discussing. But I think that if the right and responsible people want to have a president who is strong with them, that's not appropriate. And I think that's a good idea.

This is a very, very serious disease. The Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump, is showing how he has learned to deal with this issue. He defended his use of a personal email account as secretary of state during his presidential campaign, while he said that he was not using the email for official business. ""I wasn't using the email for anything personal,"" Trump said of his use of the private account. I didn't use it for anything personal. Trump has not revealed much about the email account, but Trump's team has confirmed that it was his personal account, which was only used ""during times of crisis."" Trump also said that he had viewed the email account that contained the information about his aide and that he hadn't seen the tweet or the news reports about the attack on Khan Sheikhoun. That account was in fact sent to him by an aide to the Pakistani military, who on a whim accidentally sent the email to his campaign staff in its entirety. The mistake was discovered when the aide realized that the information was in the actual email sent from Khan Sheikhoun. This is a very serious disease. It's something that is very, very, very dangerous and can't be ignored, ""Trump said."" This is one of the things that we're going to keep an eye on, ""Trump said. We won't be using the personal email account. This is a very serious disease. These are human beings that have to be treated. Trump's remark suggests that he is more comfortable with the fact that he is running the country than with that tweet or the news reports about the attack on Khan Sheikhoun. Trump used the occasion to criticize Russia for not taking necessary steps to put a ceasefire agreement in place in Syria."" They're not winning but they're not losing, ""he said. I think it's something where Russia has to get away from the table and be the one to step up and be able to take action.

Despite his comments, Trump has repeatedly claimed there was no collusion between his campaign and Russian officials to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. He has repeatedly denied any collusion. His administration has denied any collusion. What is the FBI's role? The bureau is charged with investigating investigations and deciding on whether a crime has been committed. It is also tasked with interviewing witnesses and gathering evidence in criminal investigations. What are the targets of the FBI's investigation? According to the Wall Street Journal, the FBI believes there are six to eight individuals on the list of people under investigation for possible ties to Russia. An FBI spokesman told Reuters that a small number of people were considered national security threats, presumably because of the nature of their activities. However, the FBI is not investigating for this group, according to the Journal. What happened in the election? The results of the vote have been certified by the United States Electoral College. However, the results of the election are not known. Despite the fact that Donald Trump won the presidential election on 15 November, what did the election result mean? The results of the election are not known. What happens now? The Trump campaign has said that any claims they are linked to Russia are ""a wild exaggeration."" Russia has denied interfering in the election and has vehemently rejected the accusations. Its security services have been accused of trying to manipulate the vote. Earlier this week, Russia's deputy prime minister, Dmitry Rogozin, alleged the Kremlin planned to influence the vote. What now? The US President-elect has already said he will not recognise the results of the election. What will the upcoming US election mean for Russia? The US election is almost certain to be dominated by the question of whether the two leaders will meet - a major issue in Russia and the US. Former President Barack Obama did not meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during his two terms. The US president-elect was likely to have been inclined to congratulate Trump but it is equally likely he would have avoided Trump's offer to get him to make a phone call to him. The Kremlin's response is likely to be a call to Trump. In the meantime, it is unclear how the US President will react to the election results. Here is a list of the top 10, as of the date of publishing on 15 November:"

680,"Bail out the people first, before the companies, in coronavirus crisis: The health minister says NSW is taking steps to deal with the aftermath of the H1N1 swine flu virus. NSW Health Minister Jillian Skinner says the government will release a list of all people who have been diagnosed and treated for the virus, as they take stock of what was first diagnosed, what the numbers of people infected mean and how many have died. The NSW government will also release a list of those who have had contact with infected people in the case of a case of influenza and to provide advice to those with concerns. The government will also make further announcements about the potential spread of the virus on Monday. ""We have been working closely with the Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, the Queensland Health Minister Cameron Dick and the NSW Food Authority to assess the situation and to provide guidance to those people who have had contact with this virus,"" Ms Skinner said. We have made a number of announcements since the outbreak was identified. We are in the process of releasing a list of people who have had contact with the virus and to provide advice to those people who have had contact with this virus. So far six people have died after contracting H1N1, with most of the cases occurring in Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. The Health Department says all people who have recently been infected should seek medical advice, and report any flu-like symptoms to their GP. People who have travelled to Mexico or Canada but have not yet been diagnosed can contact Health Minister Jillian Skinner on 13 21 20. They can also visit Health Information, which can be found in Sydney, on 1300 330 00. The Department of Health has updated its Ebola guidelines for public health for the current outbreak, saying people who have recently been diagnosed and treated in the country should not travel to affected countries. They should contact their GP for urgent advice. Earlier this week, the World Health Organisation upgraded its outlook for the virus to fair, after the first case of a case in the Middle East was confirmed in Australia. There have been no new confirmed cases. There were 833 suspected cases of the virus in the country that year. The World Health Organisation says there is a high risk that the virus will spread to humans. But it says the risk exists in the general population. The virus is not airborne. It is spread through contact with the bodily fluids of infected people."

""I believe that there is no way this election should be determined by this choice,"" the Vermont Senator said. She added: ""Those who vote for and support these candidates should get out and vote."" Sanders, who is locked in a presidential fight with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, added: ""Democracy must not be a partisan issue."" Unless Sanders and Clinton decided to become a ""core part of the political movement"" that would help win the White House, Sanders said it was ""highly unlikely"" that they would be able to win the nomination. She said she had not been contacted by any party which offered her the nomination, adding: ""We could not run against everyone.""

In a statement, Gore said: ""I have come to realize that a grassroots movement for change is not only possible, it's inevitable."" His role in the campaign was unclear, but the campaign would be a powerful endorsement of Clinton.

682,"Failure is a new experience for Michael Bloomberg There was no joy for President-elect Barack Obama over the weekend when his team was forced to stop briefing the press on his meeting with the newly-ensconced media mogul Michael Bloomberg. With Mr Obama's transition team abruptly leaving Washington DC after their meeting with the new president, the press office were forced to stop briefing the White House press corps on the meeting. ""The press secretary and their entourage were given a briefing by the president-elect's transition team at 2: 30 pm ET (1: 30 pm GMT),"" said a White House official. The press release was simply that they were working to brief the press. According to reports, the briefing followed a request from the press secretary. The briefing was supposed to be separate from the White House's usual, one-on-one meetings with Mr Obama's senior political advisers, but reporters are being told to move on to the press room. The latest revelation about the meeting came days after a photo from the press room showed Mr Obama, and a female aide, sitting together in a row. Mrs Obama's spokesman confirmed the meeting in an e-mail message to The Washington Post, which said: ""The president-elect told us that the press was invited to the meeting and that the press would follow up on their questions and answer questions as they were being asked."" The White House press office said a press conference and an interview for Mr Bloomberg would be held ""at some point"" on Monday. The paper reported that Mr Bloomberg's team was told not to talk about the meeting, and that it was also not scheduled to take place. The press release was also sent to The Associated Press, which said: ""There was speculation that the meeting with the president-elect will take place Monday. However, the White House has not officially said where and when. Mr Obama will officially take office on 20 January, making him the first sitting US president to take office without a cabinet position. Mr Bloomberg is the co-founder and chairman of the New York City Council, a business-savvy New York City mayor who has been a divisive figure with a range of views on issues ranging from gun control to gay rights. Mr Obama announced the appointments of two advisers to spearhead the transition team, Valerie Jarrett and Josh Earnest, on Friday. The White House said the appointments are not related to the transition in any way."

685,"Warren Buffett has the right answer to crony capitalism: women (opinion) Warren Buffett made a fortune building Berkshire Hathaway, but he doesn't have the right answer to the problem. In his new book, ""The Secret World of Investing,"" Buffett says one day the market price of a stock would fall and investors would be able to make more money. He suggests he'll invest that money in companies that raise well-educated women and minorities, but do not do so without women. It's not worth this argument, and he's right. If there's one thing Buffett doesn't understand, it's that women, even those who are good at the job, can't make great money. At Berkshire Hathaway, for instance, he says, female managers have a lower rate of return than men. This results in poor management. At companies that fail to attract women, the percentage of women in leadership positions rises. Among the most famous examples are Johnson & Johnson, the pharmaceutical giant, and Walmart, the department store chain. At private equity firms, which Buffett helped found, women hold about half the top jobs. The women who are in charge often have far fewer responsibilities than men. Buffett says it's up to women to change that. In 2015, Buffett called for a new focus on gender equality, and what he calls a ""new politics"" that takes political risks and distances women from corporate leadership. This is one of Buffett's key points. His book also provides a big defense of the concept of ""long-term investing,"" which Buffett says is built with no ""magic wand"" to solve every problem. I think we have a very good bet that if we do our jobs effectively, it will pay off. We've done it ourselves. We've made good money, ""says Buffett. And it's a good lesson for anyone who thinks investing has to be a lot of money well-paid. Buffett says he has been a contrarian at Berkshire for almost a decade.

686,"The way we talk about coronavirus matters a great deal, because the scientists concerned don't really understand what all the causes are. The scientists' research on the virus means that their work is one answer to whether the new virus is a cause or a consequence of a single outbreak. ""The virus seems to be spreading very quickly from one place to another,"" says James Donoghue, a CDC-funded microbiologist who helped develop the new virus research team, and whose own group has been developing a vaccine for the new pathogen. The new virus is more complex and more infectious than previous coronavirus strains, Donoghue says, and has a better chance of being passed from person to person. That's because the new strain is a very different strain of coronavirus from the one circulating in the Middle East; all the new strains have different genetic origins. The new virus is a new antiviral, he says, and one of the tools scientists have in their arsenal against the new virus. That means identifying the precise genes that are responsible for producing and transmitting the virus, and keeping that information secure. To try to better understand how an infectious disease spreads, Donoghue and his colleagues are working to develop a vaccine that they plan to use in coronaviruses that circulate in the human body. They also hope to start validating the antiviral that the new strain has been exposed to and making it more likely that it will spread to humans. Donoghue thinks the new strains present a more promising strategy. He points out that the new strain, he says, doesn't appear to have a toxic impact on human health, and researchers, in addition to the scientists, have shown that the virus can be transmitted in the blood, in the air, in the environment, and in the environment. The work the CDC and others are doing now is the start of a long journey. The new research group is launching a new series of public education events this fall and winter to remind people about the importance of keeping the public informed. And Donoghue says he wants to encourage people to take the time to understand the research and the new virus research. ""By not being afraid to talk to somebody, we can really make a real and lasting difference,"" Donoghue says. We could make a difference."

The World Bank said Friday that the global economy is now emerging from recession and has a ""moderately solid"" outlook. And, the IMF predicts that the U.S. economy will grow 2.8 percent this year. Yet, the World Bank doesn't think the U.S. economy can sustain an 8 percent boost this year. The IMF's economic report found that the world economy will contract 2.2 percent this year. It also sees the U.S. economy growing another 0.5 percent this year, down from its previous forecast of 2.4 percent growth. The IMF predicts the U.S. economy will contract 2.8 percent this year. The World Bank says the U.S. economy will contract 5.9 percent this year. And, the International Monetary Fund forecasts that Japanese GDP will shrink 2.5 percent this year. All this will hurt the U.S. economy, which has grown by 4.4 percent in the last three years. The report estimates that the U.S. economy will grow at around 1 percent, down from a previous estimate of 2.3 percent. The IMF says Japan is expected to grow 3.8 percent this year. The report also predicts that China's economy ""will remain on the slow-down path, with growth likely to slow to 8.0 percent this year."" The IMF says the World Bank will take a more risk-on approach to growth because the global economy is not yet on the road to recovery. The IMF's forecasts are in line with the Fed. A series of economic reports this week from leading economic powers have largely pointed to greater growth in emerging countries. The IMF's forecast is the first to take account of the actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and other central banks in terms of interest rates. The report also predicts that the European Union will grow 3.5 percent this year and France, Germany and Italy will grow 2.6 percent. Those three countries will be the next to see growth. CNNMoney (New York) First published December 8, 2016: 3: 14 PM ET RESULTS: THE IMF's latest estimates of global economic growth show that the world economy is recovering from recession and is on track to grow 2.8 percent this year.

691,"The Queen is making her most serious misstep here. It may have been because of the inconvenience caused to her by Sir John Major delaying the arrival of her heir apparent, the Earl of Wessex. But the delay came too late, and Her Majesty's words were greeted with both glee and derision by jeers from the Royal Family. If Sir John Major were still in power, it would have taken a further 13 days for ministers to begin the process of formalising legislation to enshrine a new law on the Royal succession. The new legislation was, it has to be said, unnecessarily long, and was largely rejected by the Government. But the Queen is determined to show she has tried. It would be a brave thing if she started to think about it before the implementation of the new law is complete. By then we will know precisely what the new law will say, and what it is likely to mean for the Royal Family. And the law must be clear enough for the new government to establish the new monarch as its head. We have seen many parallels with the way the Queen's private secretary, Sir Alan Reid, and her private secretary, Sir Richard Dearlove, treated Sir John Major in the 1980s. Sir Alan was the architect of Labour's policy on the Falklands, a policy that was later dubbed ""mad."" Sir Alan was also the man who drew up the 1992 Defence of the Realm Act, which set out a series of measures to curb the power of the monarchy. Sir Alan could not have been more different, he was much more willing and more prepared to speak out for the rights of the Crown. In the past, Sir Alan has been critical of the government's handling of the Falklands conflict, but he was also keen to discuss the need for reform of the House of Lords. The Queen is entitled to an honorary title such as Knight of the Garter, which recognises a distinguished and distinguished record of service to the nation. Having acquired her title, the Queen may wish to continue to do so. In the meantime, the Queen is clearly worried about her future. In the run-up to her Diamond Jubilee, she will be wary that her husband, Prince Philip, will not be around to witness her making a wholly new start. Until then, she will be one of Britain's most loved monarchs."
692,"Why we can't find hand sanitizer inside the grocery store - RT USA To combat the spread of infectious disease, it's generally recommended that consumers wash their hands to avoid spreading germs to people with unhealthy habits. But now a new study has revealed why some people can't resist the risk of getting sick by throwing their hands in their mouths. READ MORE: ""The most dangerous person in the world"": Thousands of bacteria found on US rooftops, hospital beds, police stations & other public spaces ""Many of the germs found on our hands are not only harmless but may even cause an infection that results in a painful, disabling illness, such as pneumonia or meningitis,"" the study's leader, Dr. Robert Abel, told NBC News. However, experts say they still haven't found a way to prevent the spread of a common parasite that can cause the disease, measles. The disease was first identified in 1981, and studies have since repeatedly shown that the virus can be transmitted during surgical procedures. However, the number of infections is increasing, especially in children, who are at greater risk of having the disease than adults. According to the CDC, between 100 and 150 new cases of the disease are diagnosed every year. It's currently estimated that up to 500,000 people get the illness each year. ""[There are] a lot of good reasons for preventing new health problems, but we still haven't figured out how to make those things work,"" Abel, who is also at the Cleveland Clinic, told the Cleveland Clinic. Because the infectious disease is so common, experts recommend washing hands thoroughly, and using insect repellents instead. You don't want the germs into your mouth, you don't want them into the mouth. What you have to do is let the bacteria out and spread them, ""he said. In another study, researchers found that hand sanitizers were just as effective as antibacterial hand sanitizers at controlling the bacteria."" Hand sanitizers are highly effective, but they do not eliminate all germs, ""said Eric O'Brien, a microbiologist at the University of Minnesota who was not involved in the study. While they are safe, they are not enough. While they are much more important, the researchers warned that while hand sanitizers can actually do more harm than good."
693,"Working from home is a lifesaver -- and a big danger -- for workers who stay home long enough to be paid or let go. But the real danger is being caught between two rules that are being enforced increasingly in the tech industry. You can't keep your work-life balance down while you're on the job. Most workers are probably not giving up their hours because they love it -- what they can't afford is to stay home and watch your paycheck. Many companies are trying to do this by making it easier for their employees to work from home. But if you can't face the fact that you'll be on call all day and you're only in the office at night, you're not contributing to your own wellbeing. You're not contributing to your own productivity. You're making it harder for your employees to achieve their full-time work. When the world is becoming increasingly digital, it's easy for workers to think that the best way to be able to be at work at all times is to work from home. That's not the case. When you're at work, you're at home, and you can't have that luxury. Instead, employers should be working from home, not on weekends. Working from home means you're not going to have a day off. So instead of working from home, you can have a more ""real-world"" day. You can manage things that are part of your day at work, like the time you put on your computer to do a business research project or to do a project that will increase your efficiency. If you do that, it makes you more productive for the entire working day. You can also be productive at work, even if you can't reach your full-time work-life balance. As part of a larger discussion about the importance of being at home, we'd like to hear from you. We're looking for people who are up for a full-time job, or who want to work from home, or who want to let go of a job they feel they have the potential to do well. We're asking for people who are already employed or who are living in an area where they want to work to say they want to be employed at home and that they're up for a full-time job. With that in mind, we'd also like to hear from people who want to work from home -- whether or not you're on call and not in the office at night."
694,"I'm an emergency doctor. I expect to get coronavirus. During his experience at the clinic, he was so ill that doctors said he was ""almost medically dead."" He told the court he had been ""injected with the coronavirus for the last two weeks and was in one of the worst states I have seen."" The court was told that the unnamed patient had been admitted to the clinic with two broken hips after suffering a fall. The trial, before Lord Matthews, continues. A spokesman for the MHRA said: ""The safety of patients is of the utmost importance to us. Dr Iain Frame, director of clinical services at Guy's and St Thomas"" NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""We are aware of the incident. We have been working closely with the emergency response team and the North West Ambulance Service. We have reached out to all our staff who have been affected and are offering support to those who have been affected. We are in the process of contacting the patient directly. We will have more to say as soon as we have more information. At this stage we are unable to comment further. The hearing is due to last two four days.

This is a very difficult time for Dr Iain Frame as we have great sympathy for his loss. We will be providing expert assistance to assist his family and friends as provided throughout the investigation. The trust wishes to reassure patients and our staff that we offer a full and thorough investigation into the incident. This will be fully investigated by the police. The hospital's chief operating officer, Robert Rees, said:"" It does seem totally inappropriate to have this incident in the first place. The trust has been co-operating fully with the police investigation. We remain fully committed to keeping all our patients safe. We are very sorry for any distress caused by this. The hospital has been asked to comment. In a statement, Guy's and St Thomas ""NHS Foundation Trust said:"" We are extremely sorry for the upset caused to the patients involved. The trust will also offer our apologies to the family following the incident. We will maintain a thorough, professional and transparent investigation into the outcome of this incident. We have cooperated fully with the police investigation and will be fully co-operating with the investigation."
695,"Coronavirus decisions creates big burden for college students, study finds Coronavirus, or CDV, has the power to cause the most severe illness in the United States. In a study of college students infected with the virus, researchers found that the risk of getting coronavirus was significantly higher than other strains and that those infected with it were significantly less likely to develop serious medical issues. The study was published in the September edition of the journal Gastroenterology. The CDC estimates that up to 1 million Americans contract the virus annually. It spreads through direct contact with an infected person, or through close contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. The authors of the study said that it was a surprise to researchers that coronavirus's prevalence in the United States had been so high. ""This study reveals the significant public health burden that coronavirus has on college students and should spur action to prevent or respond to this growing epidemic,"" said Dr. Michael Friedman, who led the study at New York University Langone Medical Center. Coronavirus infections are often treated with antibiotics and that can cause severe illness. It is best to prevent and treat coronavirus-associated infections not by preventing contact with infected individuals, but by treating at-risk patients. The CDC recommends that everyone who is infected with the infection seek medical attention immediately. Coronavirus can be treated with antibiotics. The CDC estimates that up to 1 million Americans contract the virus each year. The study also found that patients who were infected with the virus were significantly less likely to develop serious conditions. Dr. David Agus, of the University of Florida said he was not surprised by the results. ""The rates of coronavirus infection in college students are inadequate,"" Agus said. These results indicate that the coronavirus is a serious public health problem. The study authors cautioned that more research is needed, but the results suggest that college students should be aware of the importance of seeking medical attention if they're infected with the disease. ""Because in this outbreak, CDC's findings suggest that college students should be aware of the risks associated with coronavirus transmission,"" Agus said. Preventing infections requires a careful strategy of prevention and control. The study was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases."
696,"How to improve your chances against coronavirus Most people recover within two days and recover within three weeks, but there can be serious complications. There is no vaccine or treatment available for severe acute coronavirus, and the only treatment is a course of antibiotics. However, many people recover quickly and are able to carry on with their lives even after the infection has ended. Anyone experiencing symptoms of the infection, which can be life-threatening, should consult their GP. Most coronaviruses are spread by direct contact with an infected person's saliva or faeces - but most infections occur in the first five days after infection. For people with severe symptoms, the best course is to stay at home and visit their GP. A typical cold-like illness is called a viral pneumonia. The infection usually lasts around two hours. The body can then recover without antibiotics, and after that, the infection is usually gone forever. The main risk of contracting the virus in the first place is to the lungs, and it can be extremely serious. The virus can survive for up to a week, but if it does not, symptoms can develop very quickly. Dr Brian McCloskey, consultant in infectious diseases at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said: ""The virus is spread by contact with saliva or faeces - but this can be a very serious illness. It is extremely important to be aware of the symptoms of the virus, and to seek medical advice if you develop any. The best advice is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water, stay away from your work or school and take your temperature at least one hour before you go to the toilet. It is important to follow NHS advice and stay away from your GP practice for the rest of the day. The latest figures show an increase in the number of people presenting to emergency departments in Scotland for flu-like symptoms. Experts say this type of flu, which includes flu-like symptoms, is increasing at an alarming rate. The number of people hospitalised with flu-like symptoms now stands at 642 - three times the number last winter. Figures from NHS 24 show the number of people admitted to each hospital with flu-like symptoms has risen by almost half in the past week. Figures suggest the number of people in hospital following the flu outbreak in Scotland rose by almost a fifth on the same period last year."
697,"A common-sense approach to coronavirus crisis The scientific community wants to make the public aware of the need for a public health approach to the contagious disease A common-sense approach to the coronavirus outbreak in Australia is required. A common-sense approach is needed to reduce the spread of the virus worldwide. However, we recommend that the public, as well as the media, avoid sensationalising the issue of the global spread of the virus, which will compromise understanding of the causes and solutions and the need for a public health approach. Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""This is a very serious and serious public health issue. We need to be able to understand the nature and extent of the disease. This disease is quite serious and the risk will rise significantly unless we can manage to contain it. Until we can identify a cure, the only hope of preventing further spread of the virus is to ensure there is sufficient space in the hospital environment for the virus to thrive. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said:"" The UK has the highest number of confirmed cases of the virus in the world. Only 35 people have died in England and Wales, and all cases are suspected to be linked to travel to the region. In addition, there has been a 75% increase in the number of confirmed cases worldwide, with cases reported in 16 countries including the US, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and Italy. We are working very closely with colleagues in other countries to provide information to the public about the situation. Public Health England is advising that the public should not be worried about the spread of the virus. We are working closely with colleagues in other countries to provide information to the public about the situation. We also urge anyone who has symptoms of this virus, or is thinking of getting it, to be aware that they are vulnerable, and to seek urgent medical attention as soon as possible. The Department of Health is advising that the elderly and people with weakened immune systems should be particularly vigilant. The UK Medical Protection Society is urging people to ""go about their normal activities,"" even if not coughing, coughing or sneezing. Anyone feeling unwell is urged to contact their GP or hospital for advice on any health problems suffered by the family. The World Health Organisation has said there is no sign of a global outbreak. The WHO has said it is not aware of any global outbreak."

699,"Melinda Gates: The women who showed me the way forward, even though I will never have kids In an interview with The Guardian, the 64-year-old Microsoft founder and philanthropist said she is still ""astonished"" at how much modern technology has changed over the last 20 years. ""It certainly seems like nothing has changed,"" she said. When I was younger, my father [Bill Gates] was a great example of how technology has been transforming human computing. For the most part, we've been able to continue to take advantage of that, but we've also been able to change the world. I really appreciate how much technology has changed in the last 20 years. I'm astonished by some of the innovations that have taken place. Ms Gates was speaking at the launch of the annual Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's annual report. ""I have always said that people can do anything if they have the right resources at their disposal,"" she said. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the world's largest privately funded foundation devoted entirely to research into basic science and to the cure for human diseases. The charity's aim is to improve the lives of people including those living with HIV / AIDS, malaria, cancer, and organ failure. Ms Gates has been at the forefront of the fight against global poverty and environmental issues. Her philanthropic efforts were most recently funded by Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates. Ms Gates said she is ""enormously proud"" of the work she has done over the years to improve the lives of people in developing countries. ""I never, ever thought I'd help people in the developing world,"" she said. I've come and gone as I've always wanted to do, and I think it's important to acknowledge that. Ms Gates said she will continue to work to end poverty in order to prevent diseases and disease. ""I certainly am hoping to be able to continue to be a big part of this,"" she said. I think it's very important to understand the situation, and to change it so that we don't have to deal with it every single day. Ms Gates and her father have now gone on to spend more than $400bn on medical research since their foundation was founded in 1975. Ms Gates has also been the co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a philanthropic non-profit focused on the health, science and education of children, and their families."
700,"We're not talking to our girls enough about money (opinion) Former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., spoke with ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Charlie Rose about President Obama's recent trip to China and China's trade practices, as well as the effect of economic conditions in the U.S. and China. Rose asked if the president was trying to pull the United States into the trade wars, and Santorum quickly replied, ""I think it's part of his strategy that he is trying to force China to open up their market."" ""We are talking about a number of trade issues,"" said Santorum. There's trade with the United States, there's a lot of free trade agreements like the ones that are in place. So what is it to push China to open their market for U.S. manufactured goods, which produces more than 80 billion pounds of goods to China, and how do we get a better deal? And how do we get a good deal for the American people - for our middle class? ""We can't win a war in this country by making people rich,"" said Santorum. The fact is, it's a great country, and it has a great future. But what I think is very important is that it has a lot of world-class companies and a lot of good American companies and a lot of good American jobs. So, hopefully it is a great country. Not to mention the future. Rose asked if we were talking about China or other countries, and Santorum answered, ""We don't have that conversation at all."" So, I think we have to have a bilateral approach. And do the right thing, and make sure that all of those people who come to this country have a good job. I think if we are talking about China, we have to have a reasonable and just, reasonable conversation, and if we don't do that, then we're going to be losing jobs. And that's just not right.

701,"I live in Kirkland, epicenter of the US outbreak. We need Trump to take this seriously. As I have traveled around the country to talk with residents, you can see how many of them want to be tested. But, so far, there's been no progress. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that only five people are known to have tested positive for the virus in the United States. Those are: 14 in California, two in Texas, two in Illinois and one in Kansas. The number may climb, according to the FBI. The administration has said that they are moving in the right direction. ""One of the things we need to do now is to get people to follow the guidelines and get tested,"" James Comey, director of the FBI, said. I know that people are on the move. People are getting tested. We've got to get tested. And it's not just about travel. We've got to make sure we have the best and most effective screening people can get and our response to that. On Wednesday, the US Embassy in Mexico posted a chilling Facebook post warning Americans about the potential spread of Zika. ""If you are already at school, stay home and take precautions due to the potential risk of Zika virus infection,"" the embassy said. Even if you have had no contact with anyone who has tested positive for Zika virus, you should take precautions. It made no mention of the US being the first country to declare the virus a public health emergency. ""If you have traveled to a Zika area, or have had other travel-related disabilities, take precautions,"" the embassy advised. Don't delay your travel plans. Zika is spread by mosquitoes but transmitted through bites of infected female mosquitoes. The virus is also contracted by other mosquitoes and can cause dengue and Chikungunya. When transmitted sexually, the virus can survive for months in semen, and can be sexually transmitted in one-third of people who have been infected, according to the CDC. The virus can also spread through blood transfusions or sexual contact. Zika is also transmitted by other mosquito species, including the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The CDC also recently issued guidance to pregnant women about the risk of Zika infection and to make sure they have adequate access to contraception."

And when the new production opened to a packed house at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles last week, and some critics were quick to question star Matthew Broderick's involvement, the question many still are asking is: do the producers of ""West Side Story"" know how to get the show to do what it's meant to do? Well, some of what they have to say might be just as important. ""It's a bit like we are the guys in the park,"" said Broderick, who plays the title role.

703,"What the 'Friends' reunion makes me hope for The original sitcom ""Friends"" ended in 2004, but it's coming back for a new series starring Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green and Courteney Cox as Monica Gellar. Her character, Rachel, is a self-made billionaire who moves in with her ex-husband but it turns out she is an overachieving self-made woman who takes a job as a business development manager at a hair care company. ""The new season of 'Friends' has a very positive message that will resonate with audiences,"" a spokesman for 20th Century Fox Television, which produces the show, said in a statement. The new series is based on the 1986 comedy ""The Professionals."" Friends, after a brief hiatus, returns to television for a third season on the June 16 premiere. The series has won five Emmy Awards and sold more than 9 million copies worldwide. ""The 'Friends' show is the kind of show we could not have created if we did not think it could be so different from the rest of the TV world,"" noted Kristin Chenoweth, president of CBS Entertainment, in a statement. While the ""Friends"" films were co-produced by Warner Bros., the new series is made by Discovery Television while the NBC Universal Pictures and Syfy studio produced the series. David Chase, who played Chandler Bing, said his character ""is not happy or sad"" because he is ""really the underdog."" It was his first turn as a lead character since the death of David Chase last year. His first love interest, Phoebe Buffay, was killed off in a suicide. The series will feature many new characters, including one played by William Shatner who also died in the series. ""The first 'Friends' was one of the most iconic shows of all time,"" creator and executive producer Joss Whedon said in a statement. I would say, 'This is not a happy ending, I want to say this from the bottom of my heart, but you don't want to do it.' It's a bittersweet end to a very hard gig. I'm sure some of you will have noticed it was a very long time ago. It's been 16 years since the show's last episode, which aired on Feb. Cox joins the cast as Buffay's best friend. The new season of ""Friends"" will be broadcast on NBC."
704,"The tragic details of the killing of Amie Harwick are not fully understood, but it's a good thing that the BBC's Detective Chief Inspector Jon Stoddart's own investigation shows how our current culture cannot be trusted and has led to inaction. An eerie silence is replaced by the sound of the dead falling on top of each other. We should now realise that Amie Harwick's death could never have been predicted. This is probably the most disturbing tragedy in the history of our armed forces. To me, this is the worst case of murder I have ever seen. An inquest that would have been run by the coroner and the police must take a fresh look at this case and consider the reasons behind this preventable tragedy. The report of the former police officer, who had been in charge of the force with the highest profile of its investigations, was received by the chief constable last week. It found no evidence of systematic wrongdoing by any of the officers involved in her death. But it said the Met had introduced a number of checks on its officer training and its supervision, including ""enhanced training for officers involved in undercover policing."" This, it said, was ""not always compatible with working in complex policing environments,"" and it highlighted concerns that ""the use of the tactical firearm and live fire training should be restricted in certain circumstances."" The Met has also been given a new independent professional body, known as SO15, to investigate the claims made by Amie's family. An inquest into Amie's death will be held at Southwark Coroners Court in South London on September 2. A pre-inquest review will take place at Westminster Coroner's Court on September 13. A report on the criminal proceedings is expected to be published in the coming months. There is no suggestion that any criminal activity was committed. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has launched an investigation into the case. It said it was ""satisfied"" that there had been ""no miscarriage of justice."" The IPCC has previously said it has referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, the Crown Prosecution Service and the CPS in relation to the decision not to prosecute. The death of Amie Harwick is being investigated by the IPCC and the IPCC has referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission after a complaint about the way Amie died."

""Weinstein, a former head of the Weinstein Co., was convicted of sexual assault in New York by a judge on Tuesday. He had faced up to 25 years in prison. Weinstein's attorney, Benjamin Brafman, told reporters that it was a"" miracle ""that Weinstein had not been put to death. Brafman said Weinstein was"" very much aware of this judgment at all. """" He didn't have access to the expert witness or the evidence that was at issue here, ""Brafman said. The jury did not believe him. He added that Weinstein was found mentally fit to stand trial. Weinstein was not represented by an attorney for the defense. Weinstein's sentencing is set for Sept. The sentencing is being held in Brooklyn federal court. Prosecutors said they plan to seek a death sentence. Weinstein did not testify. His attorneys have said they plan to review the evidence used against Weinstein. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office declined to comment. Weinstein, 65, faces a total of 10 felony counts, including two counts of predatory sexual assault and one count of rape. He is accused of sexual assault with a person under the age of consent. Weinstein had been scheduled to begin serving his sentence earlier this month, but the Manhattan district attorney's office decided to move up his date to Oct. Weinstein was arrested in France on Oct. He has been indicted by a grand jury in Los Angeles on charges of sexual assault and criminal sex act. The hearing is set for Sept. Weinstein's sentencing is still pending. It is not clear when that will occur. Weinstein has asked for a continuance of his pretrial confinement, saying he suffers anxiety, depression and numbness in his right leg. He has said he is not a"" monster ""and has said he is willing to testify against anyone he thinks is guilty of sexual assault. He is scheduled to return to court Oct. 2 for sentencing. If convicted, Weinstein could face up to 10 years in prison. He could also be facing the possibility of an additional sentence of probation. He has pleaded not guilty.

Elizabeth Rosales grew up in North Carolina and attended Mount Pleasant High School in Raleigh. Jayden Rosales attended the University of South Carolina in Canton, South Carolina and attended the University of Michigan. Jayden Rosales attended the University of Michigan and also attended the University of Michigan. Elizabeth Rosales described the family as â <unk> <unk> a very close family. We are all so close.

Elizabeth Rosales also said her children have experienced discrimination in their lives as they are not Hispanic."" I think maybe we all kind of have unique perspectives on life, ""Elizabeth Rosales admitted. I think some people are not as happy with the way things are. Jennifer Rosales and Jayden Rosales have been reunited three times since the children arrived from their home country."" It was the hardest time of my life, every time I got back, ""Jayden Rosales said. Still, they found it difficult to understand what happened to their families in the U.S."" We were born in this country and we come here to the U.S. and our parents died here, ""Jennifer Rosales said. The family spent a quarter million dollars for their first trip to the U.S. Last year, they were living in a $2.8 million Washington, D.C., home that was sold to a developer. Jayden Rosales has autism and is wheelchair-bound but has been living with her parents throughout the ordeal. The Rosales will soon move into a larger home in Florida, and the Rosales will be able to give their children the support they need to live their lives. They said they are thankful for the support they have received from the U.S. government and many U.S. law enforcement officials. They just want to continue living their lives."

I was very scared. He also claimed she had not wanted to tell anyone about the ordeal because she was not sure if she would tell anyone else. But she did tell him she was really afraid of what she called her worst nightmare. I was a victim of rape for 20 years. I was terrified because I was waiting to be raped. I felt like I was dreaming about being raped again. There was no way to stop me. I was afraid she would kill me. And it was so traumatic because I didn't want to let anyone know. I thought, ""This is going to be too much for me."" 'The woman said she came forward after seeing pictures of the alleged attack on her Facebook to help protect other rape victims. When she confronted the driver and the car's driver, he allegedly said:' You can't go to the police. You have no right to rape here. You cannot go to my house. I'm very bad and very scared. 'But he claimed he had been drinking and was driving when the incident happened. He alleged he had no recollection of the incident and only learned about the rape when he woke up and saw the news on television. His DNA was found on a knife that had been taken from the woman's body and he said there was no evidence that it was bought on the internet. He also denied raping a second woman on the same night and repeatedly admitted being five miles away from the scene of the crime. The court heard that he had no recollection of being at the scene of the crime. He said there was no evidence to support that he had raped her and added:' I was extremely nervous. I had no recollection of rape. He was also asked about his relationship with another man who was also in the house at the time and described him as being 'volatile'. The case was adjourned until tomorrow. A probation report was also ordered. He was also banned from contacting the woman. His name was changed to protect his identity. He now faces a maximum of two years behind bars. He was granted bail and told to surrender his passport so he could go to prison. He was also ordered to undertake 300 hours of unpaid work."
709,"Should we give a damn about the Oxford comma? There was a time when the comma, which I was a member of, was probably a rude word for a politician. I don't think it's necessary, especially as members of the Government and as a committee of MPs I think it's a sensible thing to do. I think it's a good idea to give a damn about it. If you were to give a damn about the Oxford comma, you would not be offering support to the Government. If I was asking you what one of the problems with these terms, particularly in relation to the Oxford comma, is that they are a word that is frequently used by MPs for political purposes, I think it's a bit weak. So I think it should be a word of warning about how inappropriate it is in a Parliament. The Oxford comma was invented by the Oxford Tory MP Conor Burns in 1808 and is used as a byword to describe the politics of politics. He was also a friend of Dr John Wilkes, the founder of the Industrial Revolution. Mr Burns and Mr Sandercock were speaking ahead of the publication of a report by Labour's business spokesman Chuka Umunna on how a growing proportion of MPs use the word ""hypocrite"" at Westminster. The study found that many MPs are using such terms when discussing criticism of politicians such as former Chancellor and minister Steve Hilton in the Commons. Mr Umunna said: ""We are now getting a lot more MPs using these terms. Last year, we had a lot of people using it. It's happening in a way we haven't done for a long time. Mr Umunna said there should be more protection for MPs in the Commons, but said there was an"" obvious case for more ""reforms. He argued that the code of conduct needs to reflect Parliament's views on issues such as race and class."" The problem is that MPs are always in favour of one issue, so why shouldn't they be supporting another issue, ""Mr Umunna said. Mr Umunna said the code of conduct needed to reflect Parliament's views on issues such as race and class. A spokesman for the Speaker said:"" The Speaker is not going to comment on the report.

""This is a long term issue,"" Mr. Sizemore said. And I think it's one that we've got to fix. I think that's what this district is, and it's not. My colleagues are going to be on the record saying the best way to fix what was broken is for states and federal officials to work together. In the meantime, many in Asheville remain stunned by the seemingly outlandish claims of the Republican candidates, who have made unconvincing claims about the state of the economy in the past week. Asheville is also one of the most Republican-dominated counties in North Carolina and the only one not having a GOP candidate in office. Republicans did win the governor's race in 2014, but things haven't been going well for Asheville. According to a recent poll by the Asheville Citizen-Times, four out of five voters cited the county's unemployment rate of 8.5 percent as the most important issue facing Asheville. Those voters also said that the job situation in the area is worse than in North Carolina, with a 12.4 percent jobless rate. ""I've never seen anything like that,"" said Jody Johnson, a retiree who lives near Asheville County and voted for Mr. Sizemore. She said that she was more concerned about the economy and the economy than Mr. Sizemore, but that she still has faith in the Republican candidates.

712,"Fractured America got together on this issue. And it could point the way for more cooperation. But first, it needs to be on a framework that can lead to a transition in which the United States is not part of this rebuilding process. We may have to wait while it takes the shape of a new agreement on the future of both Afghanistan and Pakistan. But if the United States were to accept the United Nations proposal that Afghanistan should have an inclusive government; and the United States accepted that the constitution of Afghanistan should be based on the rule of law, then the United States would be bound to reconsider its commitment to Afghanistan. That is not to say that all of this has to be done on the basis of a strategic consensus, or that a new framework must be agreed. But that will not mean that we simply follow the pattern of the Bush Administration, whose approach to peace has been to go it alone. That is not a strategy, and it will not be the United States that makes significant commitments that the international community will need to implement. For the last 15 years, Washington has been conducting a war of attrition with Pakistan over the presence of the Haqqani network, a dangerous terrorist group whose members are fighting in Afghanistan. But the United States has been doing so for years, and the Pakistani leadership has been trying to get as many American soldiers and advisers as possible out of the country. That war has made Pakistan's commitment to Afghanistan more difficult than it has been in the past. The United States has also had a long-standing policy of not recognizing a government that is not benefiting from the effort to rebuild Afghanistan, even though it is the biggest beneficiary of American aid. The United States has been leading the operation since 2001, but Afghanistan, unlike Pakistan, is not a NATO ally. It is also a member of the European Union, the only region in the world that does not recognize the United States in any way. America has to make the effort to move Afghanistan from one that is in peace, to one that is seen as secure and that can promote greater security and more prosperity, and that is seen as a cornerstone of that American-Afghan relationship. The fact is that the United States still has a lot of work to do. A lot of progress is needed, and the United States has a chance to do it on its own. But there are other, more urgent tasks that are not being met. The United States must be willing to invest even more time into them."

714,"SE Cupp: A third party could get us out of this mess By James Quinn, US Business Editor Published: 6: 24PM BST 15 Jun 2009 While George Osborne may pretend that he is a ""British chancellor,"" his aides appear to have been playing on the stereotype that he is a ""British premier,"" rather than ""one of the prime ministers."" Mr Osborne is a friend of David Cameron and will give the speech at the Conservative Party Conference, which is due to be held this Friday. Mr Cameron may say that he is the most successful British leader in the modern history of the world and yet this man is not the prime minister for a third of his life. The former Tory treasurer Lord Forsyth, who led the privatisation of Royal Mail in the 1990s, has called on Mr Cameron to stand down as leader. The Prime Minister has refused to say if he will stand down. His spokesman said that he had ""nothing to add"" to Mr Osborne's remarks. Earlier this week Mr Osborne insisted that the banks were not for sale. But he stressed that if any bank were to go under it was likely to be that it needed a government rescue, not a taxpayer bailout. The Treasury has been trying to negotiate a restructuring of the country's finances with its banks. The Business Secretary Vince Cable said that the Government was not ""willing to accept anything like this because it is too big and is not going to get them out of trouble."" But Mr Cable told the Sunday Telegraph: ""We are not going to be handing over money to a bank, and it is not going to get them out of trouble."" The Government's £37bn debt pile is currently at £106bn, more than twice the £700bn figure for the previous year. The Chancellor wants the banks to be allowed to fail, but he wants them to carry on lending to small and medium-sized companies and so avoid the need for bail-outs or a taxpayer bailout. So far only the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and Northern Rock have pledged to provide emergency loans through the scheme. Under government plans, the Treasury will be able to buy the bank's preference shares or the shares of Lloyds TSB. It is also planning to use £200bn of taxpayers' money to pump further capital into the banking system. The Conservatives have also promised to pump in more cash to Northern Rock.

We look at who they are, what they've done, and how they were raised. It's all part of our ongoing series, ""The Fix,"" which breaks the story on topics from politics to business to culture to family. Have you ever been the subject of a political argument? First of all, I was 13 and I never really thought about it. I didn't really think about it at all. I kept thinking that what I was doing was a political opinion. But then I started to think about the American constitution. And then I realized that it's a constitutional document. It was written by a Supreme Court judge and it was the first time a high court had spoken, and that's what I thought about. And I realized that it's a constitution. And now, as we talk about the free press, it's a fundamental right. I'm sure it's one of the most important things to be an American. But it's also one of the most important things to be a human being. I think about it every day, in every sense. I mean, there's the debate about [the Second Amendment], the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms, the right to keep and bear arms. You know, I do think about all of these things, but it's also one of the most important things to be a human being. It's just a fact of life. You're a very kind and talented person, and I'm very privileged to have been around you. So, I don't really know what you do in that area. I never met you. I have no idea you are a political person. But I do think you have a profound respect for human life. And if I had one question, I would ask the audience, ""Do you think the media made a mistake?"" Because I think they made a mistake. They made a mistake. And they made a mistake. A lot of people made mistakes in their lives. But, if you think about it, I think that the press made a mistake. I think that they made a mistake.

718,"You can't build the truth on a scaffold of lies and try to convince people we can't give them a clean slate. And that's exactly what happened in the case of the banking industry. The banks had no compunction about using the proceeds from the sale to pay bonuses for their top executives, the City regulator said. The law is clear. If you get something that means you're paying the right amount of tax, and that's a decision taken in the good faith of the taxpayer, then it won't be illegal. But as the former Director of Public Prosecutions, Lord Justice Pitchford, pointed out, this is no way to draw the line between the rich and the poor. ""If you have a very wealthy elite, which you think they should be, it will be perfectly legal for them to put money into your pension fund,"" he said. They will then have to show how much they have contributed to the pension fund in order to be able to justify the entitlement. And there's no way that means that they will have to pay back the money they have contributed. You have got to show you have done the right thing. A lot of people will say that they are cheats because they are cheaters. The fact is, they are a very sophisticated, well-organised organisation which uses all the tools at its disposal to try to avoid paying tax. It's clear to me that if this was not illegal, it would be very difficult to justify. The Treasury has also brought in tough new rules to protect consumers. It will no longer have to tell consumers in the form of letters about what they owe. It will have to send them a notification letter demanding that it has stopped any payments to the banks. Which means that it will no longer have to tell consumers more about the costs they face. And the rules will now be changed so that a claim can be made that they were trying to avoid paying tax. The law will also introduce new penalties to limit how much people can claim back. The Treasury said: ""The banks are already being held to account for their actions. We want to make this a deterrent for people who break the law. In this particular case, we've decided to take the strongest possible action against those who tried to conceal their true financial dealings from the authorities and now are trying to get more powers to force people off their bank accounts. The Treasury added that the new powers would not affect mortgage lending."
719,"Why the black press is more relevant than ever in global affairs These are the black papers that have been doing their job for decades - covering the global events of the past 12 months - but to some the black press is only a ""reflection of the world."" It's like a newspaper saying one year after the war, but the next year is a ""year of change,"" writes the black Australian editor of The Australian. John Howard has shown his class for years: but not all black papers in Australia are on the same page, says the Australian editor of The Australian. John Howard, who used to run a media empire, has acknowledged that black papers are less important than ever in the global affairs of the future. The black papers have always been a reflection of the world. But in the last 12 months, people's perceptions of media and their thoughts on the history of the world are coming to saturation point, ""says John Howard. Black papers are getting more and more important [in world affairs]. But while black papers are shrinking, Howard says, there are no signs of a decline in overall audience figures. Black papers outnumber white papers in Australian newspapers by one to one. It is true that the Australian press appears to be becoming more and more of a reflection of the world. Black newspapers are more accessible these days,"" says Howard, who said there is a link between the rise of the internet and the rise of the media. But for many of the newspapers that are still seen as print outlets, black newspapers still have a place in the world. The black papers are not only a reflection of the world, they are also a reflection of what Australia is doing. Black newspapers have a place and we should celebrate that.

720,"Branding news outlets as foreign agents won't make them any more transparent -- ScienceDaily The American Press Institute, a nonprofit journalism organization dedicated to promoting journalism, has been unable to make any significant changes to the ways it rates news organizations. Now former AJI co-founder and executive editor Michael Gerhardt has taken an unusual step: he's started a new, nonpartisan organization called The Pulitzer Center for Public Leadership, a first for a journalism organization. Gerhardt says the Center will be able to provide more analysis of the news sources that are key to reporting public opinion. ""The Pulitzer Center for Public Leadership will be a platform for our journalism to showcase and elevate the importance of reporting,"" Gerhardt says. It's important for news organizations to have a platform that can serve as a starting point for reflecting public opinion on issues. Gerhardt, who has been working with the Center's New York executive director, John Prendergast, to prepare for its publication, is also an author and director of the news site PoliticsDaily.com. Gerhardt says the center, which will be funded by members of the media industry, is intended to ""empower reporters to report on the most important problems with public policy."" The Pulitzer Center for Public Leadership is based at Hofstra University. ""The Pulitzer Center for Public Leadership will use the tremendous power of journalism to open access to stories that matter,"" Gerhardt says. ""This is the first time a public editor was responsible for an independent, nonpartisan reporting organization, and it's important to foster collaboration among news organizations about policy and news,"" Gerhardt says. This is not the first time Gerhardt has worked with an agency that is part of the same organization, but he says that the new organization will take a different approach to reporting. ""I think this will be the first time that the same organization will be involved in public affairs,"" Gerhardt says. It will be a focal point for reporting on the most important issues facing our country. The Center will also be able to bring its own expertise to the Pulitzer Center, which he says will add credibility to issues ""that are widely reported, often in the public contexts."" Gerhardt says the Center will seek to empower reporters to report on everything from the 2010 election to the 2016 presidential election. His new organization is headed by Prendergast."

A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said: ""Jeremy's full statement is the same as a previous statement by the Shadow Cabinet Office Minister - it is a clear clear document of his commitment to the rule of law. The Shadow Cabinet Office has a responsibility to ensure that Jeremy Corbyn is fully aware of his responsibilities to the Labour Party and its members. Jeremy's commitment to a free press is a matter for the party. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said Mr Corbyn's comments show"" he's not fit to be Prime Minister. ""He added:"" Only a Labour Government will allow him to govern as Labour leader. He added: ""The Liberal Democrats are a party of protest, of hope, of fairness, of hope. The fact that Jeremy Corbyn's idea of a free Press is now being considered by the Press Complaints Commission proves he doesn't know what he's talking about. We'll be campaigning for a law where the Press can't be removed from the political agenda. Mr Corbyn said:"" I have always had a very strong view about the free Press. Mr Corbyn said it was ""unacceptable that a newspaper should be taken off the political agenda,"" adding: ""I've always been clear about the need for a free and independent press."" Mrs May's spokesman refused to be drawn on the issue of Mr Corbyn's commitment to a press before the election. She said: ""The Prime Minister is focused on her job winning the general election and ensuring that the country is a successful, broadly-based country."" She added: ""Jeremy supports the news industry. BBC journalists are essential to our democracy and to our democracy. The Tories claimed the Corbyn / McDonnell document showed that he was"" actively engaged ""in activities that"" undermine Press freedom. ""A BBC spokesman said:"" Jeremy's proposal for a press law would not just apply to Labour, it would also apply to a wide range of other public bodies and no commercial bodies - no matter who they represent. ""He added:"" Jeremy thinks this is an important issue, but we accept that the Labour Party has a legitimate and important role to play in protecting the democratic process in this country. ""The BBC could not immediately reach Mr Corbyn for comment. A Labour spokesman said:"" Jeremy believes in free speech and those who disagree with him need to come and speak to our internal party procedures.

In an attempt to calm the crowd in the northwestern city of Idlib, thousands of armed men opened fire on the opposition's rally, killing at least 40 people, including fighters in black clothes. Assad's government did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. In an interview with CNN in January, Assad said a Russian proposal to send weapons to rebel forces was nonnegotiable, and the Syrian president has said the plan"" would not solve the problem. """" Russia is not the solution, ""he said. Syria's government has claimed that the U.S. and Israel have not had any contact with it and has accused it of supporting extremists. Assad said the Americans have never sent arms to the opposition, and has warned that if the U.S. continues to back unelected regimes, he will respond to them by launching attack on the Syrian government. The Kremlin did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. Syria's state-run news agency reported Sunday that the United States has already approved the deployment of anti-aircraft missiles. The report said the missiles are intended to be deployed in eastern Syria. The United States has supported Arab interventions in the region, and U.S. officials say that Assad has been able to overthrow much of his regime despite strong resistance. But U.S. officials have not officially authorized the deployment of anti-aircraft weapons in Syria, so it is unclear whether it would be a real or imagined response. The U.S. and Russia are likely to disagree on some issues at the U.N. Security Council over Syria, but relations between the two countries have improved recently in recent months. They saw a dramatic improvement in ties after a January agreement on the political transition in Syria. The Syrian government began negotiations to end its nearly six-year civil war in 2011. It has brought in U.N. monitors and international mediators in an attempt to end the war, but attacks have continued. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.

725,"The Trump administration is hiding something about the program. In February, the Trump administration announced that it would cut off aid to countries that are providing the program to North Korea because of the North's nuclear and missile threat. The agency said that even though it had evidence that the program was not being used, it was willing to continue providing North Korea with oil and other aid if Pyongyang did not abandon its nuclear weapons. As a result, the program has been suspended. ""We do not have evidence that the program is being used,"" said John Bolton, the U.S. national security adviser. We are not seeing evidence that North Korea is violating international law or not abiding by the rules. We do not have evidence that the program is being used in violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution. The U.N. Security Council unanimously passed a new resolution in September banning the North from carrying out ballistic missile or nuclear tests. The new resolution specifically prohibits North Korea from developing, testing, or testing ballistic missiles, nuclear and chemical weapons and related material. Kim Jong Un has said that the country's nuclear and missile programs are a necessary security guarantee. The country maintains that the program is for defense. The North conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test in February and has been ratcheting up its rhetoric ever since. In the face of increasing pressure and sanctions, North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests and numerous missile tests. South Korean activists have called for a resumption of the program and a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests after the U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in response to its nuclear tests. Pyongyang has made similar demands since 2006. Pyongyang has also denounced the U.S. for not doing enough to stop its nuclear test, as well as the recent nuclear test. ""The U.S. is still in the nuclear arms business,"" said Park. We are in the nuclear business now. The sanctions mean that North Korea's nuclear and missile programs are a security threat for the United States.

726,"What this will cost Mitch McConnell. If every Republican senator were to vote to repeal Obamacare, what would happen to the repeal law? In a recent poll, 46% of Republicans said they now support repealing Obamacare. Only 14% in a recent CNN / ORC poll said they would support repealing it. If McConnell does not support repeal, did he vote to repeal Obamacare? The answer was yes. Many Republicans voted no to Obamacare. Some said they would vote for it, but they didn't want to vote on it. If McConnell doesn't oppose repealing Obamacare, what would happen to him? The Senate majority leader has already indicated that he would try to repeal Obamacare in a new election year. But he would have to try to get enough Democrats to back him. Why are the current Republican leaders so opposed to repeal? They are angry that McConnell has not done more to repeal Obamacare than they are. But they also worry that McConnell is too cozy with the insurance industry and that they will eventually bring down the Affordable Care Act. The most likely result of McConnell's refusal would be that Republicans will have control of the Senate. The new Republican majority will have the power to cut off funding for Obamacare if it is rejected. And the health care law will remain in place on a piecemeal basis. The Senate will be under Republican control for a few more weeks, and it is unclear how many Republicans will vote for Obamacare repeal. ""Democrats voted no because they're not confident that, even if they agree to continue to serve as the majority, there will be Republicans who are willing to compromise to achieve what they want - even if their party is not going to be able to do it,"" says Kathleen Sebelius, an Obama administration health care secretary. Mitch McConnell's silence on the repeal issue is a sign of how much this legislative fiasco is hurting Republicans. One big Republican senator who has expressed support for repealing Obamacare said: ""Mitch McConnell, I think, is in a very difficult spot."" You can watch the full interview with the Kentucky Independent, and watch the full video above. The Senate will vote on a new health care bill on December 7. If the bill passes, it will have to be reconciled with a House GOP proposal to repeal Obamacare. The bill will likely be delayed by the health care bill."

Watch the full story on ""CBS This Morning"" Saturday, Nov. Donald Trump's lawsuit threatens to disrupt his presidency. The president's legal trouble comes as his lawyers are challenging a provision of a federal travel ban that would bar Americans from traveling to the United States if there is a ""credible, present and substantial risk"" of national security. The president has sued the Justice Department and other federal agencies, saying that the ban violates his constitutional separation of powers, as well as his constitutional right to form a national security advisory panel. The Supreme Court this spring ruled in favor of his administration, and the president has said he plans to revisit the case. The judge's ruling sent the case back to the lower court for reconsideration. A panel of three state appellate courts will hear the case on Tuesday. The case is set for trial in June.

But the department will not send a case to federal court to take up cases, and it can take up to 60 days for the lawsuit to be resolved, let alone before the court can consider a decision. The department requires applicants to provide a written declaration in an e-form, and will send them a video of their application, to provide a copy of their visa application, and to provide a copy of their application. Applications for a visa are processed on a case-by-case basis. It's possible to reapply by phone at the SBA's Customs and Border Protection Center at Ames, Iowa."
728,"House Democrats can't miss this valuable opportunity to pass a historic jobs bill today. But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) will not be making a major announcement on the bill. He is also not scheduled to address the media until later today. That means he won't be sharing with his colleagues anything important at the time. One thing the White House is not counting on is the news of House GOP votes on a plan to raise the country's debt ceiling, a move that is expected to put the pressure on the president to make the announcement as planned. That announcement is expected to come tomorrow. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said Saturday that he was ""very confident"" the Republicans would have the votes to pass the bill when the House returns next week. But a senior House GOP aide said Boehner will still not say whether there will be a vote on the bill. The aide said Boehner is still prepared to wait until next week to decide whether to bring the bill to a vote in the House, and then announce the final details. If the president does not sign the bill, it will be an early Christmas present for House Democrats. The White House has said, as Obama has done over the past week, that the House will vote on the Senate bill next week. House Democrats want to keep the Senate bill from going to Obama for signature, and the White House wants to avoid that. Still, the White House is hoping that the House will pass a bill that will keep the government funded through the end of next week, allowing lawmakers to return to the Senate for a vote next Wednesday. The White House has said it wants the Senate to pass the bill and not go to Obama for signature. Boehner has said the House is ready to approve the bill if it is amended significantly. The Senate bill has been highly controversial among conservatives, with some conservatives arguing the bill would be a gimmick on a government spending level that falls short of the tax-cut pledge that Obama and congressional Democrats have demanded. But the Senate leadership has said the House will vote on the Senate bill next week. ""I'm pleased to see that the House leadership is committed to passing the Senate's bill,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said in a statement to reporters Saturday. But I'm pleased to see that Senate Republicans have the votes to pass this job-killing bill. I remain confident that the Senate will pass the Senate's job-building legislation."
729,"Trump's' I want nothing 'defense doesn't hold water on his foreign policy ""I want nothing"": Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Colorado Springs, Colo., Friday. In the last several weeks, the president has faced criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for a series of foreign policy decisions. Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have called on President Trump to release his tax returns, telling him that releasing them would violate his constitutional oath of office. But Trump has insisted that releasing his tax returns would not violate his oath of office. ""I really am the only person in the world that is going to release them,"" he said at a rally in Colorado Springs, Colo. I think they are going to be very big news, and maybe people are going to say,' Well, you know, I've done something. 'I want nothing. But I also think it will be a big issue... I think it will be a really big issue on the campaign trail. Trump has said he plans to release his tax returns sometime next year. His tax returns show that he earned $25 million in 1995, 1995 and 2001, and he earned $52 million in 1999. He also released his income and paid about $52 million in child taxes. But he had to pay $28 million in back taxes and penalties because he did not file his taxes properly. Republicans have charged that Trump's tax returns, to be released in the coming weeks, show that he is profiting from foreign policy decisions that he has deemed unfavorable to the United States. ""It is clearly a terrible situation for the president if he released his tax returns right now,"" said Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., chairman of the committee. If he released them right now, he would've paid all the taxes he owes. But a look at their returns over the last several months shows that his income, his expenses, all those things have been much higher than many of the other countries of the world that he's visited. The Democrats have criticized Trump for not releasing his tax returns, and Republicans have accused him of not being transparent about his tax returns. In the House, Republicans have proposed a bill that would mandate that Trump release his tax returns, which the White House says would be a violation of the oath of office. White House spokesman Raj Shah said Friday that the proposal was part of an effort to reach out to the president."

""This is a significant moment,"" Hirono said in a statement Wednesday. If the House doesn't pass this impeachment resolution, it is going to be immediately referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee for consideration. The House has already impeached Trump, but it could also take Senate action. Instead, the Senate should take up the impeachment resolution on Thursday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has insisted on pursuing impeachment in all cases and has said he has yet to decide whether to bring a motion to send the matter to the House floor for consideration. As of Wednesday afternoon, the Senate had voted unanimously to try to launch impeachment proceedings. But Trump's supporters, including Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., have argued that the impeachment process is the best way to ""restore"" the president. ""If he's done something wrong, he should be impeached and should be removed from office,"" Whitehouse said Wednesday on MSNBC. The president's supporters have also tried to show unity, and argue that impeachment is the better way to try to get Trump out of office. But they have also expressed frustration with the congressional process, which is dominated by Republicans. ""It's all about me and me,"" one senior White House adviser told CNN last week. I don't know anything about impeachment. The White House has been eager to put the president over a barrel, saying that in the case of Trump, ""he's never been impeached.""

Her life is the story of a woman who happens to be me - a writer who has written a piece on how to be happy, and a woman who has written about how to be kind. We're talking about a woman, who recently asked me to write about her life. I know she's a hero, who's an incredible person who has just written a book about life - and who's a little bit of a mystery. I've been writing a blog on everything from feminism to love of food. I've been a critic, and I've been a writer, so it's kind of hard to put me in that category, though. But I think I'm more comfortable as a writer now. I've been writing a blogpost, which is how I was when I was a kid, but I've always found writing a book about my life to be really interesting. Here are some favorite quotes from her blog: I wrote this while I was a teenager, and while reading a news article I found myself looking at a picture of an animal, and I thought ""How many of these will do you believe?"" I'm not sure what they are, but I think that there are plenty of people who like animals, and they enjoy, or love, animals. And when you know that animal and you know they love it, that's when you have the feeling of satisfaction. That's when you need to understand that human beings are complicated and complex and complex. How will you respond to the critics? I think it's only natural to always be the one to critique or to try to be sympathetic, but people still come at me. I try to make a point not to treat them that way. It's different in this world, and women, as a whole, are not always sympathetic to the opinions or the opinions of people of other faiths. But we all know that when there's an audience, if you know that it's not in your favor, the audience is not going to listen. But they're still in the room. When people are not hearing that, they just move. It's clear from some of the posts that I've created and the comments I've made. I don't need to go into the audience again."

735,"Single, childless and nearing 40, I saw one real option, the one I'd done with my husband, as a way of bringing up our two-year-old. I could not only teach her how to deal with a child, but also how to stop her getting into trouble. I offered to take her to my local council, so she'd have a permanent home there, and then we could live together. I also had a conversation with the social worker who would help her with her children in the local authority, and they would accept my application. Then she got in touch and said she would put me in touch with the family housing officer for a temporary place to house her. It's amazing how quickly things can change. I've spoken to a lot of people about it, and I got in touch with the social worker about what I could do and how it would work for them. It's a lot easier than going to a meeting with a councillor. The councillor I spoke to said he'd always be a ""positive and supportive pastoralist"" as well as a good father. I really liked him and I'd said to him that I wanted to bring up my child myself, and now it's like a gift, and now it's lovely to have someone else, maybe my own daughter. As a widow, we're trying to find somewhere for her to live and we've definitely got some sort of baby. I don't want to see her go back to an arranged marriage. I'm 38 and I'm not going to be able to be a mother for many years. I don't want to be dependent on anyone, I want my children to have the same opportunities as I have. I'm only doing what I can to provide for my family, and that's to raise my children so that they never have to go through what I've had.

736,"We asked, you answered: How IVF changed your lives? When I first came out, I was 40, and the doctor said, ""You need to be 50, by the age of 35."" I said, ""Yes, I am getting pregnant."" As soon as I went into that room I was like: ""I'm going to be a mother."" I'd been thinking about that for years, but no. I'd never dreamed of being pregnant. When I came out, I'm like: ""You know what? I'm going to be a mother."" Nobody even asked me, ""What did you want to be when you first came out?"" I was like, ""No,"" and for the first months I was just waiting for my body to change. But by the third year, I was like: ""I really want to do this, I want to be pregnant, and I want to work."" I was like, ""Why not?"" I said, ""It's gonna be fun."" I felt like it was really fun. As I was waiting for the right moment, I was like, ""I'm pregnant!"" I had just been really excited about the whole process. I felt like I had finally found my happiness and it's all now. I can't wait for the season to sort itself out. I have so much energy and I think it's all good for me. I can focus on my baby now. I'm so excited about it, and I think it's a good time for me. ""Say,"" I want to be a mother. """" The whole process was difficult, but if you were in the room with all these different ladies and you were like, ""Oh, my God, let me have just one kid and one kid,"" it would be a really easy decision to make. But now that I feel I must do it, I have to just focus on one kid first. That's the best thing. I would love to have a big family one day, but I am not sure if I ever will, it would be amazing.

737,"Trump meets a new enemy as he faces North Korea test Tens of thousands of North Koreans gathered in Pyongyang for a huge celebration of Kim Jong-un - the birthday of his grandfather. The rally was a repeat of a large mass rally in 2011, and is sure to increase tensions between Kim Jong-un and Washington. The BBC's South Korean correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes reported from Pyongyang: ""Just as we speak, US President Donald Trump meets a new enemy whom he has publicly called"" Little Rocket Man. """" The US President expressed his concern at what he described as Mr Kim's ""belligerent"" speech, and called on the North Korean leader to ""stop provocative actions."" North Korea staged the historic parade in 2011, and the North Korean state media said the new leader had ""sent a resounding message"" to the world. The parade was watched by tens of thousands of people, and in 2011 Mr Kim was named as the successor to his father, Kim Jong-il. He has since been trying to maintain his power - particularly by launching nuclear tests and missiles at US and South Korean airfields. North Korea has also threatened to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike if the US and South Korea continue military exercises which it says are preparation for invasion. The BBC's China Correspondent, Stephen Evans, says it is a big day for North Korea, and as the country is preparing for a major rally, the news that the US president's meeting with the new enemy will take place is of particular interest. The BBC's Gavin Lee at the rally in Pyongyang says the parade was broadcast live on state TV, and many of the thousands who attended the rally on Saturday had travelled widely across the country for the occasion. The North Korea-US military drills, which began in late April, have drawn criticism from the international community, and the South Korean military said the drills were routine. North Korea has been criticised by some countries for conducting exercises that it sees as a rehearsal for a nuclear attack. On Friday, North Korea issued its own rare apology to South Korea, calling these drills ""provocative"" and demanding that Seoul ""take stern measures"" against the army's ""reckless and suicidal"" acts. ""The war will not end on the Korean peninsula,"" the foreign ministry said. They will not give up their nuclear programmes. We will fight them militarily and jointly."
738,"Trump's intelligence implosion and the rise of the so-called 'alt-right' is a new phenomenon, and the president has signaled that he is going to start cutting the FBI. The FBI's director, James Comey, is due to testify on Capitol Hill on Thursday. The president himself has vowed to 'review' the FBI's handling of the situation. In a series of tweets on Monday, he said that he was' not worried about the New York Times report 'and that he would' be fine 'if it was true. A White House official said Trump did not follow through on his threat to fire the spy agency, but that he would do so if it meant a' substantial loss of public confidence. 'Mr Trump also said he would not be changing his decision to arm Syrian rebels. The White House said on Monday that it' had not been considered on any list of areas that we could consider for additional defense support. 'The State Department said that the move reflected the' need to maintain close coordination with allies, 'but stopped short of suggesting that a blanket policy could be developed.'The President has made clear that he intends to review this matter and will make his final decision in due course,' department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. The UN Security Council will meet on Thursday to discuss' further steps', the White House said, including a possible vote on a resolution. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Wednesday, Mr Trump did not rule out the possibility of further measures in response to the chemical weapons attack. But he said he was' not inclined 'to allow Assad to survive. Assad has been a target of international outrage for the past week, after a nerve agent attack on civilians in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun near Idlib. The suspected chemical attack killed at least 87 people. Mr Trump said Wednesday that' it's a shame that Assad would use chemical weapons again, 'as a signal that Syria was becoming a' big, big trouble spot. 'But Assad is the' butt of the joke, 'Mr Trump added.'The slaughter of innocent babies, women and children is a sham and it shouldn't be allowed to happen.' The president said he had met Vladimir Putin 'several times' in the past and said that they have discussed the Syrian crisis at least twice. An administration official said Mr Trump and Putin have discussed the Syrian crisis multiple times. Mr Trump said they had a 'very good and very frank'"
739,"These people could make Trump's life miserable. I just hope the press catches this and puts him behind bars. This is the man who's supposed to be a Democrat and he's been caught. People are going to think, 'What a waste of a year I guess.' Trump claims he never saw the video, but denies making the video on purpose. If it was my son, I would have just posted that video on Twitter. I didn't see the video, ""he told CNN's Anderson Cooper. The controversy over the Trump-Russia investigation deepened on Wednesday when the House Intelligence Committee released a heavily redacted report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. In it, committee leaders said Russian hackers stole personal emails of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, and that the FBI had identified"" thousands ""of emails that it believed were hacked by Russian intelligence. Moscow has denied involvement in the hacks, and the Kremlin has said the hacking of the Democratic National Committee was carried out by a hostile campaign. In a statement to CNN, Trump's attorneys told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the White House has no evidence to support the committee's charge that Russia was involved."" What it does not do is suggest that it was a Russian operation, ""Carter Ruck, a spokesman for the Trump Organization, told CNN."" It is all unfounded, ""he added. The White House has not confirmed the identity of the Kremlin's source of the alleged hacking. Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in the hacking of the Democrats' emails, according to the CNN report. CNN's Elizabeth Landers contributed to this report.

740,"Trump gets an unwelcome surprise, but there are plenty of other reasons to love America's President Donald Trump's presidency has become an unwelcome afterthought for many ordinary Americans. But there are many reasons to love America. The most common are the endless energy and enthusiasm it affords all Americans, the freedom to self-indulge and the sense of belonging that has made America great. And if that is what you want, then why not embrace it because it is an unstoppable force for good? President Trump and his family have called the White House a ""wonderful family"" and they have been through some ups and downs during the past month. But their joy is palpable. I have known the President for decades. He is an incredibly private man, not even a public figure. I have seen the President work long and hard for his family, his country and his country. He has a singular focus when it comes to his office and has never wavered in his belief that he can make America great. Even those who were not close to President Trump during the 2016 election have spoken about his energy, passion and drive. I have known him for a long time. He is a fine man, a strong leader, a great friend, and I believe he will continue to do so in the White House, ""said former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. I have known him for so long, and I am thrilled he will continue to do so in the White House. I have nothing but admiration for President Trump,"" Clinton said during the campaign. On Thursday, as we gather in Washington for the inauguration, I am very sure what I will be doing will be different. I am not sure how I will manage the transition process up to now, ""Trump said during the campaign. I will be doing a lot of things. I will be doing a lot of things with people that I feel very strongly about. So is Trump a genius? Perhaps. But for many Americans, that is a question that they are being asked before we begin celebrating Friday. In his speech, Trump said he"" looks forward to being president of the United States. ""I look forward to being a great American, a great man and a great family. I look forward to being a great American first. And I look forward to the challenges ahead. There is no better choice for that than being President of the United States of America,"" Trump said. There's no better man to lead the country than President Trump."

742,"The biggest surprise in Trump trial will be his mental state, and it may well be that will count for something. But he may have to wait a very long time before he is seen as fit to serve as president. Trump has already shown that he is not that interested in public service. But his ability to be an effective leader is enhanced by his ability to manipulate the public, to turn unpleasant individuals into threats and to have his friends and allies intimidate and harass others. He has shown that he can run with his opponents, using his power to win elections by intimidating even his closest supporters. He has shown that he can manipulate the media, by using his power to get the press to spend more money on his campaign. When he is not the commander in chief and is not inclined to change his positions, he will be the president. This will likely be some time in the future. But in Trump's own words, the president was ""willing to go as long as he has to."" By that he means he has willpower. The question is how long that willpower can hold out in the face of unexpected adversity. It may turn out that Trump will be able to turn his White House into a prison. In the meantime, it will be possible for him to serve out his full life sentence. He has the power to make America a better place.

743,"Why Trump hired Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz to represent him in Russia probe - RT America Published time: 30 Mar, 2017 15: 57Edited time: 30 Mar, 2017 17: 00 Ken Starr, the former prosecutor, and Alan Dershowitz, a former White House counsel, have been confirmed as special counsel to the special counsel Robert Mueller, who is looking into Russian meddling during last year's US election. The pair have been scheduled to testify before the Senate judiciary committee on Monday. Starr, a Democrat, served as a prosecutor in New York for 29 years before he retired in 2009. He is now a senior counsel at the firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and to the US Chamber of Commerce. Dershowitz, a lawyer and former general counsel for the Republican National Committee, has a long history of legal expertise, serving as chief counsel for the George W. Bush White House. At the same time, he served as the Special Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. Starr's expertise will come in the form of public statements, but it is not clear whether the special counsel will charge any officials in the Trump Administration. It is also not known which Trump associates may be under investigation. As a prosecutor, Starr created controversial decisions relating to the prosecution of drug dealers, which the US Department of Justice is currently investigating. In 2013, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation, but later returned and recused himself from the investigation. When the investigation was initially launched, Starr said that he was not under investigation and that he had no recollection of the conversations the special counsel had with his lawyer or the investigation. During an interview with CNN on March 18, the special counsel described allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia as ""absurd."" The White House has also denied any collusion between Trump campaign operatives and the Russian government, and said that the allegation is ""categorically false."" Starr and Dershowitz will be joined by assistant U.S. attorneys David Kelley and George Cole in the legal team of Christopher Wray, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, who has been nominated to serve as Trump's special counsel.

744,"Cracks emerge in Trump's wall of GOP support The Republican presidential nominee said he had a ""great relationship"" with Senate Republicans and would ""be honored"" to work with them again. Mr. Trump told reporters that he had met with the four Republican senators -- Bob Corker of Tennessee, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, John McCain of Arizona and Jeff Flake of Arizona -- on the phone this morning and that he had a ""great relationship"" with the senators. ""President Trump called me today to wish me well,"" said Mr. Trump on Twitter. I will miss you, Senator Corker, and his Family. Sen. McCain returned to Washington after an unannounced trip to Europe where he met with Mr. Trump and the leaders of all the other Republican-controlled congressional committees. ""I had a very good conversation with him yesterday afternoon,"" Mr. Trump said. He spoke very well. I appreciated his insistence that we get things done. He appreciates the fact that he's going to have to make some sort of a deal on the massive border wall. The president also said he would ""be honored"" to work with Mr. Graham on a bipartisan immigration bill. The meeting was the first such conversation between the two men since Mr. Trump was elected president in November. However, neither were able to produce a positive outcome in a meeting on immigration Thursday night. Corker told reporters that the two senators had an agreement on immigration reform that would end the deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants. Graham is expected to meet with Mr. Trump on Saturday morning. Senator John McCain is expected to meet with President Trump Saturday afternoon but won't be present for their meeting. ""I'm disappointed that we did not finish things at the end of the day and that we did not get to a positive outcome,"" Graham said. I think for the most part the president is going to be focused on the issues and working with Congress. So I'm disappointed. McCain, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said earlier this week that he would vote against the bill if it included a pathway to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants. ""I do not want to see this bill,"" said McCain, a staunch conservative. It is not a strong bill. It is not strong, but it is not a good bill. I stand with the president and I stand with the President. I want to see it passed, ""he added. I think that will be the best bill."

Trump has been criticized by the President and his supporters, however, for failing to condemn white supremacists after the violent clashes that broke out between neo-Nazis and anti-fascists. His administration has since responded by condemning violence by white supremacists on the street, but has been increasingly critical of what it refers to as ""alt-left"" groups that espouse the alt-right agenda. Trump will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday, and is expected to make a formal statement on the violence.

However, the president said he did not want to talk to the show's star because of his apparent"" lack of patriotism. ""The White House had reportedly been attempting to inject a little levity into the debate. As the president noted on Monday,"" There's a certain sort of patriotism that comes with being an American.

VIDEO: Trump says he's open to talks with North Korea President Donald Trump says he would be ""honored"" to meet Kim Jong Un, but has no interest in meeting with Kim. FEROUS: Trump is in China -- where he holds his first- ever meeting with China's President Xi Jinping. EXCLUSIVE: ""The President was very clear that we are looking at the possibility of meeting with somebody else,"" said a White House official. We had a very productive discussion yesterday. We felt that the President and I all agreed that we would have to do a joint meeting with North Korea that would be good for the world, good for China, but we also agreed that we would need to make sure that North Korea understands we're looking for opportunities to talk. That's why we're talking to North Korea. There's been no timetable for that. Backing up Trump's statements about Kim, North Korea's ambassador to the U.S., Pak Myong Ryol, said the North ""has shown a different stance from a previous time"" than its predecessor. The U.N. Security Council is considering new sanctions over North Korea's nuclear and missile program. The U.S. has said the sanctions would have an impact on North Korea's fuel exports, but the White House has yet to set a date. Trump said he was ""absolutely"" open to talks with North Korea. The President's remarks come amid heightened tensions between North Korea and China. In an interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he'd be open to dialogue with the North Koreans, if it happened. But he said the potential for North Korea to be a nuclear state was only becoming more evident. ""We have to see what he's going to do, but I would be honored to meet with him,"" Tillerson said. These sanctions are one of the most severe that I've seen in my entire career. CBS News' Barry Petersen and Elizabeth Palmer contributed to this report. Trump also added that ""a lot of people"" on both sides in the conflict were ""losers."""

Michael Flynn offered to serve as Trump's national security adviser, but Trump rejected it. Michael Flynn offered to serve as his national security adviser, but Trump rejected it. Flynn was fired as Trump's national security adviser for lying to Vice President Mike Pence and misleading the vice president about his conversations with Sergey Kislyak. The president fired Flynn on May 9. In his resignation letter, he wrote that he ""shared these views with General Flynn and General Kelly."" Trump himself criticized Kelly's response to Comey's memo, saying it betrayed him. He also lashed out at the former general and called him a ""leaker.""

The book is called ""Stopping the Postal Service From Removing the Flag From the Union."" The Postal Service is currently facing a $15.7-billion loss.

754,"I was Anthony Bourdain's' censor 'at CNN. I will not be working for another channel. CNN and Stacey Dash, chief executive of CNN Worldwide, explained why they were taking a very different tone to the other news outlets. ""The fact is that CNN - an organization that upholds the highest standards of journalism - has been undermined by Donald Trump,"" Dash said. It is just a shame that, in the middle of our democratic process, Donald Trump and CNN have become so polarized. CNN, which does not accept contributions from corporations and unions, also declined to comment. But some conservatives have raised concerns about the relationship between the president and the network. ""The president has not always been in the corner, but he has never been the silent leader,"" Republican strategist Kellyanne Conway told MSNBC. CNN, like TIME, does not endorse any candidate for president. Instead, CNN simply goes out of its way to support candidates, including Mr. Trump, who frequently speaks out against news organizations that attack his administration. The network has been particularly active in the presidential campaign, hosting a town hall with Mr. Trump on the occasion of his surprise victory. The White House will hold a big rally on January 26 at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. The event will include a conversation with Mr. Trump and will be held on January 27. The rally is set for 6: 30 p.m. The president will also speak to the crowd after the rally. Jeff Mason, former director of political research at CNN's Washington bureau, said the Trump campaign's decision to allow the rally will have little bearing on the network's coverage of the president, who will be in his first campaign rally in Pennsylvania. ""I don't think it will have much impact,"" Mason said. They'll broadcast the whole thing as it happens. I don't think the president will have an impact on what CNN does. I think he'll be more comfortable. Trump's victory will come as a surprise to many in the news media, but Mason said they have seen plenty of successes in recent years. CNN hosts have managed to sell more of a book than Trump, who said during his campaign that he wanted to bring back ""CNN's original scoops."" CNN has a record of winning elections, Mason said, adding ""the CNN magic will last."" ""We're taking a big risk with this [Trump] election,"" he added."
755,"Trump's failure to fight climate change is a crime against humanity, say scientists Mr Trump's continued reluctance to take action on climate change is a ""crime against humanity,"" a US climate scientist has warned. The president-elect said in his first news conference that he was ""changing his mind"" on the issue - but stressed he would fight the ""enormous"" costs of the problem. The president-elect's support for the 2015 Paris climate accord has also been questioned by scientists, who say that burning fossil fuels is also a source of climate change. The US climate scientist, Richard Dyson, told The Guardian he believed the president-elect's support ""is a terrible thing for humanity"" and was ""not very useful."" I think it's been a crime against humanity. If it was a crime against humanity, I think that would be something that he would have to sort out. I think he would have to step back and look at it, ""he said. He added that the Trump administration should engage with his critics and critics who had"" lost their minds ""because of his decision to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement, which obliged all nations to reduce carbon emissions. The US has just withdrawn from the Paris agreement. It's a terrible thing for humanity,"" he said. He said his findings would have ""an impact on the entire world."" Mr Dyson said that to make progress, he would need to ""pay some attention to the science and the solutions that will deliver the most benefit to the world."" The climate scientist said that in the coming months he would ""have to see a lot more about the science"" and will consider ""whether or not it's worth some hard work at some point."" He said that he hoped to do his own studies, but added that he would have no difficulty finding the ""right answers"" on climate change. ""The science is clear, it's not a science,"" he said. We need to make it clear, it's not a science that I'm interested in making decisions on. Dr David Lawrence, director of the Earth System Science Center, a global environmental organisation, told The Guardian that the Trump administration would not lead the world in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. ""It is absolutely imperative that the president-elect gets serious about climate protection,"" he said. He's absolutely the guy who can make that happen. I think he'll make a good choice. Dr Lawrence said that global warming was ""fundamentally different from what"

Biles went into the final few minutes trailing by eight. She was able to finish with 84.5 points a lap around the finish line but was never able to make up the gap. It was a stunning performance by Biles, but her overall time was only 81.8. At one point she was taking the lead with a gold medal around her neck. Biles said after the race that she was just happy to be in the final. ""I'm just happy to be in the final,"" she said. That means a lot to me. She finished with an 83.2 points average and was followed by Kerri Walsh, who is also a gold medalist at the Olympics (83.4) and gymnast (83.0). Biles said her emotions at the finish line were very different than the ones she experienced the final day of the competition. ""Emotions are not to be taken lightly,"" Biles said. You want to make sure you have the best preparation for Beijing. You never want to be disappointed. Biles and Tessa Virtue are scheduled to compete Tuesday. Biles is considered a favorite to win her first gold medal at the Olympics, becoming the first Olympic champion in gymnastics history to win the all-around title. She also won a bronze medal in the team competition at the X Games, and one silver at the world championships in Montreal in 2006."

760,"Trump and Putin: the pictures tell the story It is one of the most famous photos of the world leaders meeting. They are pictured at this week's G7 summit and at the G20 in Hamburg this September. They are each pictured looking uncannily like their comrades - but with one another. We take a look at the pictures - a close-up of their faces, a closer look at their face compared to their faces. The image has emerged as speculation continues that US President Donald Trump will deliver a joint press conference with Vladimir Putin in Hamburg later this month. Here are some of the other images which have been published in the press in recent days. Trump and Putin met for their first face-to-face meeting in Helsinki in June 2015, when the Russian president was President-elect. The pair reportedly discussed Ukraine, Iran, and Syria in the call. Trump said they discussed the US 'readiness to bring the Syrian regime to its senses'. Putin was also seen congratulating Trump on his win in the US presidential election, saying the Russian leader had fulfilled his campaign promise to help the country 'to defeat terrorism'. The president-elect also praised Putin on the day he assumed office in the United States. The pair met at the G20 in Hamburg in June 2015, when the Russian president was President-elect. After Trump made his surprise announcement on Twitter about Putin joining the US on Syria, he tweeted: 'Thank you very much for joining me in the fight against ISIS.' But Trump's decision to enter into a military training zone with Russia has been criticised as a violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations after it was signed into law by the United States. The European Union has said it would not recognize the move. Trump has also been accused of failing to take a strong enough stance on Russia. The US president said a recent meeting with Putin and Merkel reminded him of the Cold War ""when a man died in a plane crash and then every time an American president flew over and congratulated a friend."" Trump replied: ""As good as it was, in many ways it was a very bad moment. Now, they are both dead. This is an unfortunate day for Germany and also for the world. When asked if he was referring to Putin, he replied:"" Not today. ""The two leaders were photographed together with their faces obscured by a white patch of sand on the horizon behind them."

In the days ahead of that event, both Presidents will have to deliver an address to the National Urban League Convention, which is expected to draw hundreds of thousands of people to Washington, DC. Here are a few suggestions to prepare for the speech: ""I would suggest: Listen to the speech carefully to help you understand what it means to be a Trump supporter. Listen to the speech as carefully as possible to communicate your point of view. Ask for your opinion, not to be taken, as this is a political speech. Don't get involved in what is a politically-charged speech or a private event. If you are planning on attending the event, please stay away and respect the speech. Regardless of whether it is a presidential address or a speech, it is important to understand that it is not a speech about the country that is important or that you are speaking about the party that is in power. It is a speech that is about you and about the country. Be very careful of any actions that might be taken that might affect national security or that might be perceived as partisan. Listen to what comes down to one thing: what is in your best interest. This speech is not about me. It is about the future of our country. And this speech is about what is a critical moment for us. The American Dream is alive. It is a foundation and a guarantee of the future of every person, not just a privileged few. It is an American dream. It is the hope that every man and woman has - the hope that every child has - and the hope that every child has - that every child has - in their heart, in their mind, in their mind, in their gut, in their heart. In just one generation, our country has been built upon belief in the promise of a better tomorrow. And we are not going to give it up. Today we are going to honor our commitment to honor it. So here I am. Congratulations on your 90th. Donald Trump is a powerful and historic figure. You will be right there alongside him tonight. Thank you, God bless you.

762,"Michael Cohen implicates Trump in hush money scheme Michael Cohen, the president's longtime personal lawyer, has apparently admitted to paying hush money to women who said they had affairs with Mr Trump. It is a rare admission of an affair that is being investigated by the FBI, but is also likely to increase pressure on the president and his son, Donald Trump Jr., who has been ensnared in an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The investigation is looking into possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The president's son has denied any wrongdoing. Mr Cohen has been under scrutiny since he took a $130,000 payment from lawyer, Michael Cohen, in a secret video conference. The payment was allegedly made to silence the woman who said she had an affair with Mr Trump. In an interview with ABC News on Monday, Mr Cohen said: ""I know it sounds like I'm lying. I don't have a lawyer. I don't have a lawyer. I'm not a lawyer. It's not like for me. He also said:"" I got the money from the Russians. I paid the money. I gave it to my wife, Ivana, and in exchange I got Ivana out of the money. He denied that he had given his wife any money. His lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said Mr Cohen had ""done nothing wrong."" ""This is an investigation of a man who is a well-established family lawyer and president,"" he said. This is a man who can be very, very, very, very cooperative and very difficult to defend. The president's son, Donald Trump Jr., has taken an increasingly aggressive stance against the president's eldest son, insisting that he acted alone, and that any money paid to the woman was done in the name of his business interests. The latest developments in the FBI investigation are likely bolstering pressure on Mr Trump and his family, as he has repeatedly attacked the FBI investigation as a ""witch hunt."" The president has repeatedly said that his lawyer should be ""ashamed"" of his actions. Mr Giuliani said: ""I understand people are angry, and everybody will be angry about Michael Cohen, but he has to be held accountable.""

""The plaintiffs may also argue that the judge overstepped his bounds. The judge's ruling is a major development for the plaintiffs. In court papers, the plaintiffs said they would not oppose the ruling but would use it as a platform to press for justice.""

764,"In 2017, Trump revived feminism, saved satire and reinvigorated journalism in the American repertory. He won. ""Politics in America is one of the most powerful tools that we have available for dealing with the challenges we face,"" said Pulitzer Prize-winning author Barbara Kingsolver, in an interview with CBS News. It is a tool that has already been used in policing to help prevent mass shootings. Politicians use it to fight crime. People are scared to vote for somebody who stands up, argues for gun control, or makes statements that people cannot understand. And it is used to fight back against the very liberal ideas that are the product of the liberal media's current political agenda. Politicians have a responsibility to inform people that a serious issue is at stake. The answer is to be honest with them. And there are few more corrosive forces than the threat of a Trump presidency. The prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency could spark dangerous clashes between the liberal media and a Trump electorate that is already angry and disenfranchised. ""The more we see of this election, the more we're going to see a Republican Party that is just not very conservative,"" said Kingsolver. The election of Donald Trump is really going to be a kind of rebuke of the liberal media. People are going to be angry. And that's exactly what we're going to see. The next time a Republican presidential candidate is elected, they are going to have to be willing to lose a battle to defend this very liberal, conservative instinct. And the next time they're going to be confronted by a Trump administration that is so hostile to those values and who, as a consequence, is going to be so highly polarized and polarizing, and so dependent on the media, that they may have to turn to someone else. It's hard to say for certain what the Trump presidency will bring to America. But let's not forget that our political systems have been built by people who were raised in a progressive, conservative environment. And I think our culture is going to shake out of it.

765,"30 top takes of 2017 American Music Awards 2017 winners Their annual duet was cut short on Wednesday night when the 'good news' singer Jared Leto accidentally sent her to the stage with a forearm on stage - and was promptly scooped up by music producer Naughty Boy, 28. However, after learning about the accident via Twitter on Thursday, the band, who had been on hiatus since November, were awarded the Best Spoken Word Album for Popular Song. Taking to the stage with their co-host, JJ Beams, Camila Cabello, was a vision in white as she strutted out of the stage, shortly before they revealed the dreaded 'bad news'. The 20-year-old songstress melted the hearts of the crowd as she opened up with some heart-wrenching words, while the audience screamed in joy - before performing a moving medley of their favourite hits during the show. However, they later appeared to reaffirm their tears, with an emotional Camila telling the crowd: 'I just want to say thank you to all my fans who have supported us on our way. We did it at that time and we enjoyed it. We get a little bit better every year. It's been the most amazing 12 months.' Before they were announced as winners of The Daily Star, Bebe shared some of her favourite award ensembles from the show as she performed live during the ceremony. She said: 'I'm humbled and grateful to win this award. But when it came to the night, I couldn't be more speechless. This is the award for me. I want to thank my family, my friends, my team, and all of the amazing fans. Thank you so much. But the award went to Camila Cabello, who was previously nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album, and also won the award for her track Havana. Dierks Bentley, Luke Bryan and Harry Styles, who all won Best Contemporary Christian Music Award, took to the stage to accept the trophy - which was presented by Camila. The handsome singer wore a velvet suit with the top button of his shirt unbuttoned, and also wore a pair of dark sunglasses. The star-studded show was hosted by comedian Jimmy Kimmel, 48, who picked up the award for Best Duo / Group Performance for his track, Sign Of The Times, and was seen speaking with the audience in between laughs."
766,"Why I'm speaking up about Mark Halperin, and why I stayed silent so long We are not the first to raise the topic. According to some sources, Halperin's sexuality has remained a mystery since he was first exposed by The Washington Post in 1997, when he revealed that he had been an alcoholic. Halperin, a staunch conservative and former ambassador to the United Nations, was also at the center of a controversy involving sexual harassment allegations in 2016, including claims that he had been the victim of a sexual intimidation. Halperin denied the claims as ""simply false"" and continued to express his thanks for the support he had received from all people in the world. It was a sentiment not lost on Halperin, who appeared to have moved on with his life since he chose to remain anonymous. ""I feel that I became a stronger person as a person,"" Halperin said in a 2015 interview with the Washington Post. That's the best that I can do. I believe everyone has to change their ways. And I do. Halperin is now the only Republican in the U.S. Senate to remain silent on the sexual harassment allegations. The Republican-led House and Senate are investigating Halperin's actions. Democrats have called for his resignation. Halperin, who made $1 billion in net revenue in the last fiscal year, is the most high-profile figure facing sexual misconduct allegations since then-Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell's (R-Ky.) resignation in July 2017. In 2013, then-Republican Senator Norm Coleman (Minn.) resigned over sexual misconduct allegations. In 2017, congressional GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz (Utah), the House Oversight Committee's chairman, announced he would not run in the 2018 midterm cycle, and former Speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.) was forced to leave the GOP after acknowledging he had been ""badly mistreated"" during his time as a House speaker. Chaffetz resigned a month later. File Photo by Pablo Martinez Monsivais / UPI In recent years, the House has been under scrutiny over allegations that the House had failed to act on sexual harassment and misconduct allegations, including Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. Republicans have called for Moore to resign. The Senate Ethics Committee is also looking into allegations that the Republican majority did not inform the House of Representatives of allegations that Moore molested teenage girls when he was in his 30s."
767,"Nikki Haley: An unprecedented step on human rights The US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley. Washington: Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, has announced an unprecedented move in the war on human rights in Syria. With UN approval she will take her oath of office on Wednesday, just a month after a new, bipartisan, Russia-backed Security Council resolution was adopted to authorise aid to Syria in the face of the continued regime's brutal and indiscriminate attacks against civilians. ""I am sending the most serious signal the United States can be a global leader on this issue and on what's happening in Syria,"" she said during a speech on Tuesday evening. Now that that we have the support of the UN and our partners around the globe, all of us can now act to prevent the cruelty and the suffering and to respond to the humanitarian crisis. Ms Haley, who took office in February, came under fire for her decision to approve the resolution, which she called ""an extraordinary step."" ""For those who wanted to use the word 'strategic' to describe the regime, it will be the first time in the history of our country that we have been attacked by a civilised nation,"" Ms Haley said. The council had backed the Syrian government in its fight against rebels seeking to topple President Bashar al-Assad, accusing it of mounting a ""brutal campaign"" against civilian populations and the medical system. Russia, an ally of the Syrian regime, blocked the resolution, leaving the US with the unenviable task of reining in President Assad's regime using its veto power and the United Nations Security Council to try to prevent more bloodshed. Ms Haley said the US would target leaders of those countries that support the Syrian government, including Russia, China and Iran, the only countries with veto power. ""Assad's murderous regime is killing its own people, their own people, and they are having a great time with their children and their sick people,"" she said. They are losing all legitimacy to do the job that the international community has asked for them to do, and they need to do it fast. If they are allowed to carry out this crime, it cannot be allowed to continue. She said the US would ""hold accountable those who support and arm these murderous murderers and their backers."" with Karla Adam"

So, for the past 17 years, we've talked about how we got here in the first place and that it was all good. And now we have to wait for the next generation to see how that progresses.

771,"George Takei: On this Remembrance Day, I hear terrible echoes of the past The most recent memory I have of the time I was a child when my grandfather, a World War II vet who had served in Korea, died from an accident. He was 94. I lived more than 100 miles away in New York. He was a veteran of the Korean War and so on. It was a terrible time. This year I have grown up not knowing what the Korean War was. I'm not sure at all. I was deeply saddened by the loss of my grandfather. But I was never sad for a moment. I knew that, and that is why I am so grateful to the president and first lady for their help in that process. It is for me a great privilege to be a veteran today. I am glad that the president and first lady have been so generous with their time to raise money for our veterans and their families. I am incredibly grateful to the men and women who have dedicated their lives to our country. I never thought I would get the chance to serve in the United States military. After serving in Korea, I went to the United States as a young man, and after I grew up, I never could have imagined that I would one day be a part of a memorial service honoring our veterans and family of fallen soldiers. On this very day, I remember the horrors of war, and the people who sacrificed their lives and their lives and their families for us. I am grateful to the men and women who served our country in the service of others. But I know that I am not the only one. I am a mother. But I am also a father. I ask that you continue to support our veterans and their families on this anniversary. And I ask for your continued prayers, and support for our veterans. And I ask you, as Americans, to stand up and honor the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend our freedom. As to the men and women who fought and died to protect us from the evil of war, we must never forget them. The day I met my grandpa, we stood in silent prayer in the shadow of the White House. That was the day we stood together. That day, I hope, is when we remember all that we lost in Korean War and its consequences. I wish all Americans a peaceful day. And I promise that we will honor them here at home."

I believe it's a sham, and it's a sham. These are the facts. The facts are, this race was a sham. The American people believe that this was a sham. The facts are that the race was a sham. The American people believe that this was a sham. And I still believe it's a sham, and it's a sham. And I think we should be very concerned that this is a sham. We should be terrified that somebody in the White House is telling the American people, you're going to win this election. Look at this thing with a black eye: Is this a sham? That's all nonsense. Senator Susan Collins, R-Maine, who is running on an anti-immigration platform, has called for Congress to investigate the issue. ""I am absolutely disgusted with the reckless and irresponsible actions of Mr. McAllen,"" she told reporters on Sunday, referring to his past comments on the sham race. Mr McAllen's Republican opponent, state Assemblyman Mike McGreevey, said he would not support the nominee. The race is likely to be a long one. Although Mr McGreevey has never held elected office, he has appeared to be more moderate than his former boss. He has argued that illegal immigrants, who are mainly from Mexico, deserve to be deported, and he has endorsed abortion rights. He once said he would ""do everything I can to get back to New York."" Mr McGreevey, who has been endorsed by a number of prominent Republicans, faces Democratic candidate Eliot Engel of New York in the general election. Mr McGreevey is seeking to become the second openly gay Democratic congressman in recent history. He is also one of four Republicans running for mayor in New York. He has previously said he would not run for office. Mr McGreevey is expected to face a stiff challenge in the general election."

The current system, he said, is ""not working for the White House."" Noon believes the president has come to dominate the stage but that the next two years will be critical. The president will need to articulate his vision -- and offer an alternative vision -- at some point. If not, then the American people will have this crisis of trust, ""Noon said. He pointed out that in the early days of the Bush administration, President Bill Clinton's policy ideas were more populist than his rhetoric."" I think the president's rhetoric is exactly the same today, ""he said. He's clearly more populist than he used to be. Noon predicted the second or third term, if he manages to govern, will be defined by the issues that matter most to the American people."" He's doing a lot more than Obama, ""Noon said. If that happened, we could see the last year of the Bush administration. But this will be a very different environment. We'll have a new president.

777,"The long, strange trip to the 2016 election: a cartoon view of the election trail Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, is heading to Iowa on Thursday to campaign for Donald Trump and deliver a speech, in which he will call for ""a second look at the political class,"" according to a posting on the website of his campaign. It's the first time the political front runner for the Republican presidential nomination has spent time in Iowa since he announced his candidacy in 2012. The tour begins in the community of Iowa City in the evening. Trump, the former businessman, is also expected to speak at the Iowa Republican Party dinner. He has expressed interest in attending the dinner, which takes place at Iowa State University, which holds its annual dinner. Trump has not yet decided whether he will attend. The Republican candidates, including Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, and Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, are campaigning in Iowa. The next debate is scheduled for Jan. 29, the night before the Iowa caucuses. The final tally will be announced on Monday. Here's a look at the previous night's events in Iowa: Mitt Romney, former governor of Massachusetts, is heading to Iowa to deliver a speech about the economic state that will be broadcast on CNN, a CNN affiliate. The former Massachusetts governor will also campaign Friday in the state, the day after Trump is due to address the Republican Jewish Coalition's annual dinner. In the town of New Bedford, Iowa, Romney will hold a rally with other GOP candidates. The event will take an evening start, and supporters will receive a free ticket to the event. The debate will be moderated by ABC's George Stephanopoulos. Romney will attend, but there are no scheduled events scheduled with him, according to the campaign. He is scheduled to be the keynote speaker at the party's first official event, an afternoon event. The event will begin with a speech by Romney, who has spent the last couple of weeks in Iowa campaigning for Trump. He will then fly to Las Vegas and attend a dinner with supporters before returning to Washington. Here are excerpts from the speech. ""I'll tell you with this particular certainty,"" Romney will say.

778,"Barack Obama: America will take the giant leap to Mars As the US prepares to set off on a journey to Mars in a 2029 ""Pan Am"" rocket, President Barack Obama has said the country's ambition of landing humans on the red planet is ""not far-fetched."" Speaking to ABC News, he said that it was ""possible, if we wanted to do it, that we can do it."" ""I would also point out the notion that we have a reasonable chance of landing on Mars and if we do, then we will have a pretty good chance of being able to do this,"" he said. Over the past few decades, the US has embarked on a new and ambitious mission to take humans to Mars. It has built a ""Space Launch System"" (SLS), a complex rocket which is meant to carry astronauts to the red planet. Nasa's Orion capsule is expected in 2017, with a journey taking six days and five nights. The new rocket will carry a crew of two astronauts. The president said that ""we really do want to get out there and do something to return a piece of our DNA back to the moon and back to Mars."" He added: ""We're not aiming for that, but what we're aiming towards is that we get a manned, safe return to Earth, and eventually to Mars."" This is not the first time that President Obama has stated that America is likely to do a space mission. In February the president said that America is more likely to join the international space race than to join the European Union. ""If you look with both the Europeans and the Americans, even though we have this space race, there are enough resources to go around and still try to find a way to get to Mars,"" he said. And so there are going to be a million people who want to go there. Once the humans leave earth, the first humans will be sent to the Moon and back on the surface. In 2014 President Obama revealed his intention to conduct a manned mission to Mars, despite the fact that Nasa has made no firm commitment on sending humans on a trip beyond this year. However, when asked for a timeline, the president said: ""We're still looking to do it."" This has led some in the space industry to question whether the president is seriously considering inviting Americans to travel to an asteroid on Mars."

She said there are two phases of the system that have to work. One is that you have to be realistic, and you have to work hard to achieve progress, ""she told co-host Charlie Rose. That's not easy. The second part is that, you know, the job is to build on that. When the president walks into a room, you can either be in a meeting or you can be in a real meeting. And that's true for me. You don't have to be in a race meeting or a race meeting to be successful, Obama said. The first thing I can do when I walk in a room is to say, 'Well, I've got a lot of energy and I'll go do what I have to do to get everybody else to follow me.' And that's what I'm trying to accomplish. And I think that's what I'm trying to accomplish. And you're going to see the results come in. You're going to see people vote for you, and it's going to make a difference. And they're going to show up and vote for you,"" she said.

And that we're going to start winning. We're going to win. And we're going to start changing America. And we're going to need you to win. And they're going to have to listen, because they're watching how I'm handling it. And they're going to have to see how I'm handling it, and they're going to have to see how I'm doing it. Asked whether she feels personally responsible for President Obama's campaign, she said, ""No, I feel personally responsible."" The first lady believes it's time for change, she says, because ""what is needed now is a real America that works for everyone."" The first lady also said she and the president are looking forward to many additional opportunities to make their lives better. And it's his job to take care of them."

781,"Could Zika be the next HIV? The CDC has now confirmed that there is a new virus that's causing a spike in cases of Zika infection in the U.S. These include Zika virus, an infection caused by the virus, which is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, as well as sexually transmitted diseases like HIV, dengue and chikungunya. The new virus has already been found in the Caribbean and Latin America, according to a new report released on Monday. Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested 28 populations of Zika in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Of the people that had been involved with the study, 23 had been infected with Zika, two had dengue, and 12 had sex with an infected person. Scientists believe that the new strain could cause dangerous birth defects in some people. ""Zika, Zika virus and genetic variations in the Zika virus are all related,"" said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, a vaccine researcher at the CDC. The virus is definitely present in some of these populations, too. While the virus is also circulating in some parts of the world, it is also spreading in Africa and parts of Asia. Earlier this week, the World Health Organization said the virus will likely not be found in the US and the Caribbean. ""Zika virus has been detected in almost every region of the world and not just in the US and Caribbean,"" said the CDC. There have been no cases of Zika transmission in the continental United States, but there have been isolated cases in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The CDC says that because there is no vaccine or treatment for Zika virus, the most likely route is through mosquito bites. ""It's important that we find better ways to contain risks in this area, but this virus is still a threat,"" Mermin said. While it's not clear whether Zika virus will reach the U.S., researchers said it's ""highly likely"" that mosquitoes will be carrying the virus in that country. ""We're not talking about a dengue virus,"" Mermin said. We're talking about a virus that can transmit Zika virus, and is capable of transmitting virus to people. Zika virus isn't a cause for alarm. It's not a problem when a traveler experiences the Zika virus. It's not a problem when you arrive in the United States. It's a problem when you come back here to the United States."
782,"The real terror threat in America is homegrown Fear of terrorism is everywhere in America, from the South to the East Coast. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that 50% of Americans worried that the country is headed for a terrorist attack. A top national security adviser confirmed the concerns, saying there is no evidence of an immediate threat, but that American officials are taking every threat seriously. A senior State Department official told reporters that the intelligence community has been conducting extensive surveillance of potential threats to the U.S., but there is no evidence, and the government does not have information of a specific plot or organization, to attack the U.S. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said U.S. counterterrorism officials are working to identify threats and take steps to counter them. Senior National Security Adviser Susan Rice said Tuesday that the United States is ""well prepared"" and has a high level of confidence in the homeland. But, she also said that a ""very small"" number of Americans are ""willing to engage in violent acts."" ""We certainly are vigilant,"" Rice said. We have a high level of confidence in our homeland. She said the U.S. will ""do whatever is necessary to protect the homeland."" The State Department is also seeking to improve its ability to counter terror threats, she said. We know that we are less competent and less focused on counterterrorism than we were. So we do have a lot more to do, ""she said.

783,"Your son needs to read Stanford rape victim's letter to you. When she spoke about her rape, he began reading her letter. She was disgusted. I told him that a lot of people rape women. She didn't want to go back to such a situation. She felt like she had let her mum down, thinking that she deserved it. She said that she never wanted to get revenge on him. She felt like she had let him down. She added that she had always believed that she was the only woman raped in the world. She never wanted to stand by and do nothing. She thought that she still had every right to feel safe. It was quite clear that she was never going to ever be able to trust again. She had lost her confidence. She had lost her identity. She was not sure what was wrong with her. She thought that she could get away with it. It was a very tragic experience for her. The letter went on to say that she hoped that an experienced sex therapist would be able to help her to deal with her trauma. She said that as a result of her experience, her life had become ""so much more difficult."" A woman who was raped by her own son had ""lost her identity,"" she added. She said that she had felt suicidal and really upset at the thought of going through the trauma again. She also said that since the alleged rape she had been ""shocked by the support"" she has had from people. It has made me realise that I understand the effects of rape. I would never want to have my rape history ruined. It is unbelievable that something so horrific can happen to a woman that is so poor, and it feels like a nightmare. I think that's why I just want people to be understanding. I hope that my case will help anyone who is experiencing the trauma to get the help they need and to be able to stop feeling like they need help. The woman's sister also provided a statement to the court. She said that the letter was a ""devastating and heartbreaking"" experience and that she and her family wanted she to thank the man who he had committed the crime. This man has put an innocent woman in the hands of a man who should be in prison with no chance of parole. He has ruined my whole life and I hope that I will be able to put it behind me and move on with my life. I am still here to tell the truth and to be able to help other people."
784,"'We need a restroom revolution' The first thing a man wants to do when he gets up in the morning is to go to the toilet. But a British man has sparked a debate about the bathroom revolution that could see him have to change the toilet seat every five minutes. Richard Heene, from Warrington, Ireland, is not the first person to experiment with changing a toilet seat. He has been known to change a toilet seat every ten minutes, but he says he ""just doesn't"" have a problem with people thinking the bathroom is dirty and demanding a change. The 59-year-old, who has won nine gold medals and is also the first person to have a 3D-printed passport, said that he would rather change the seat every five minutes, rather than being worried about changing a toilet seat every 20 minutes. Richard Heene (centre) says he does not have a problem with people thinking the toilet seat is dirty and demanding a change But he has a problem with people thinking the bathroom is dirty and demanding a change, and instead, he is asking people to think again. He said: ""Everyone has a different mind and they have to go,"" I don't want to have to change the seat every five minutes. ""If they want to change something then I want them to think again and think what can they change that would make the toilet more comfortable. After he changed the seat, Mr Heene claims that he had to resort to using the toilet cubicle to get away from the smell, adding that he would rather have it fitted a few more times. His solution for bathroom issues, he said, was to not use the toilet seat"" a lot. ""The toilet seat is a huge problem when you are in a busy public place. This isn't the world we live in... but its a shame,"" he said. Mr Heene told the Mirror: ""I don't have a problem with people suggesting this is the best solution to fix the problem, we just don't have a problem with people opting for this. I'm a huge fan of bathroom changing. But now it's like a knife. You have to be sure that you don't scratch a knife. The couple first began experimenting with a portable toilet seat, which they have had since 2004. They have had more than 18,000 people sign an online petition urging the public to make a change about the toilet seat. More than 5,000 people have signed another online petition urging the public to change the toilet seat."
785,"Rob Ford died of his more acceptable disease, cancer, his family says CORAL GABLES, Fla. - The family of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford said Friday that the Toronto City Councilman died of a more acceptable form of cancer, brain cancer, two years after he was admitted to the hospital for treatment for alcohol and other issues. Rob Ford lost his battle against the disease, which has only just begun to spread, but the family said it has been ""a source of great sadness to us and to our entire family."" The family said in a statement it is launching a fund to pay for counseling for Rob Ford, who was admitted to the hospital on June 18 for treatment of alcohol and substance abuse. The family previously said that Rob Ford ""died of a progressive disease, a disease that has been a source of great sadness to us and to our entire family. This is a terrible loss of a life that should be celebrated and remembered. We are offering an overwhelming tribute to all of us who have been through the pain and suffering he has suffered. The Toronto-area councilman was diagnosed with Rhabdoid systemic anemia, a rare disorder in which red blood cells in the body converge to form poisonous white blood cells. Doctors said a third patient, Doug Ford, a longtime friend, was tested for the disease and showed no signs of any symptoms. Rob Ford admitted to smoking crack cocaine and drinking alcohol last year, but said he was clean at the time and did not want to be a distraction. His family said he was suffering from a serious pneumonia and was hospitalized for a week after he was admitted to the hospital. The family has said it does not want the public to know about other problems he has had, including unspecified personal issues and his relationship with a woman. Ford resigned from his post as mayor of Toronto in October after a federal investigation of his use of crack cocaine and alcohol. He said in the first two years of his mayoralty, he had spent"" time and energy on the campaign trail for all of us who care about Toronto. ""He has been dogged by scandal since his brother was elected mayor of the city last year, after video of him smoking crack cocaine surfaced. Rob Ford was charged with drug possession and assault in August. Before the allegations surfaced, Rob Ford was a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump and made controversial comments about Mexicans."
786,"The four big questions about Donald Trump (Opinion) The new week has finally begun for Donald Trump. His campaign is facing the most serious test yet of his presidency. How do we know that a Republican who is already a presidential candidate would be able to defeat Hillary Clinton on November 8? And how will his business deal with Vladimir Putin make a difference to the fight against ISIS? How will this unpredictable and unpredictable president make a difference to the election? He has the potential to change the world in an instant. His new brand of populism has, in effect, taken over the United States. The first wave of people who voted for Trump are not going to vote for Hillary Clinton - they're going to vote for Hillary Clinton to make America stronger. But how do they know that the future of America will continue to be shaped by the people who elected Trump? Many of us have seen a great many American exceptionalism that has characterized our culture and values. I am an immigrant, and I was born in Mexico. I was able to attend college in the United States, learn American, and have a job at a textile company. I will be voting for Donald Trump because I believe he understands and understands the needs of working people. I have never voted for a more democratic Republican or liberal alternative. I'm voting for a pragmatic, conservative American who will focus on issues that affect people with different needs. I believe in working people as Americans first and foremost. I believe in a strong economy and strong national defense. I believe this country is stronger when we work together. I believe that America is better when we choose the leaders we elect. I believe that America is better when we engage with the rest of the world. I love our country. I love our people and I will be voting for Donald Trump for the next eighteen months. I will be voting for him because I believe that America is stronger when we work together. I will be voting for him because I believe that America is best when we work together, and I will be voting for him because he will be the voice of the working people. We need each other, and we must be united. I will be voting for Donald Trump because I believe that America is best when we work together. I will be voting for Hillary Clinton because I believe that America is best when we work together. I will be voting for Hillary Clinton because I believe that America is best when we work together.

787,"David Axelrod: A surprise request from Justice Scalia Re ""The Power of a Supreme Court Scalia"" (editorial, Oct. Mr. Axelrod's comment that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's appointment as the first justice, rather than Justice Stephen Breyer, signals a more conservative legal philosophy is not supported by any facts. In his view, Justice Ginsburg is ""more politically conservative than Justice Scalia"" and, in fact, is ""far more populist than Justice Ginsburg,"" a fact that is in turn supported by any evidence of dissent. In fact, Justice Ginsburg is far more politically conservative than Justice Scalia. The Supreme Court has not had a conservative justice for more than a century, and the court has not had one of the more conservative justices. Justice Ginsburg has done a remarkable job to uphold the Constitution and to protect citizens against government interference by imposing limits on the government and its activities, notably on the right to bear arms. We should not let the Constitution be used as an excuse for refusing to enact the law. Justice Ginsburg is not a politician. For Ms. Ginsburg, she is a candidate for the highest office that Congress, and the nation, needs. But the same need is coming from the White House. It is the right of every American to defend our Constitution and individual liberties. Replacing Justice Scalia with Justice Breyer would be a costly and unnecessary mistake. The writer is a lawyer. The writer is an associate at the Public Policy Institute of Nevada. The writer was a political consultant for George W. Bush's 2000 and 2004 campaigns. Re ""Ginsburg's Wife Has Internal Affair"" (editorial, Oct. The Supreme Court's most senior conservative is a remarkable woman, but she is not a political force. Justice Ginsburg is not a politician. She is a public figure who has done much good for this country by making the court a more conservative institution, with liberal judges who would not be affected by a change. The writer is executive director of the American Association for Justice. To suggest that she is somehow not a ""real person"" is disingenuous. Justice Ginsburg has been a Supreme Court Justice for 25 years, and she has done a remarkable job to uphold the Constitution and uphold the Constitution. She is not a politician or a Republican. She is a woman."
788,"Donald Trump's Super Tuesday amnesia on race and the GOP debate There was a time when America was still undecided about its future. America was still playing catch-up after a period of presidential hopefulness that saw Bill Clinton lose the presidency and Donald Trump win the Republican nomination. The US election was officially decided by nearly a million votes, but was overshadowed by the revelations of Donald Trump's now infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tape. Donald Trump lost to Hillary Clinton in the US presidential election. Photo: Reuters It happened in November of 2000, when the US was still in the early stages of the crisis. The American public viewed it as a national disgrace and turned against the Republican establishment, which they regarded as hopelessly out of touch with the ordinary working class. The election was decided by nearly a million votes, but was overshadowed by the revelations of Donald Trump's now infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tape. The tape showed Trump boasting about groping women without consent, and mocking the women of the New York Times. A host of celebrities, politicians, journalists and reporters, including Hillary Clinton, Bill Gates and Tina Fey, have called for Trump's resignation. This wasn't just a big scandal, it was a watershed moment. It's a black day for the US political debate, whose impact is still to be felt, ""said Professor David Halberstam, a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley. US President Donald Trump, pictured in New York, is no stranger to controversy. In June 2000, he famously refused to shake hands with then-Vice-President Al Gore, after the two men met in Washington. In October 2015, Trump refused to shake hands with his chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, after the latter ran a failed campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. The incident also fuelled deep divisions in the Republican Party, with some members calling for Trump's impeachment and others condemning him for his conduct. The man who has now said he will not sit down for a joint press conference with Hillary Clinton on Tuesday - Dr Ben Carson - was criticised for failing to take a strong enough tone in his response. His reaction drew criticism from some conservatives in the US media, with US media outlets, including Breitbart News and The Washington Post, labelling him"" pathetic. ""The next day, he sat alongside Hillary Clinton and later signed a document calling on the party to"" take a stand against the assault on"
789,"Donald Trump brings out the worst in people in a crowd of 4,000 Donald Trump has brought out the worst in people - and he is not willing to let them get away with it. The Republican presidential frontrunner has been visiting a small, hard to reach community in Ohio where a series of rallies have been held. He was greeted by a crowd of people in a quiet, quiet street in Cincinnati. Mr Trump urged them to vote for him on November 8. ""As for the other big states in the country, Ohio is going to be one big prize,"" he said. Mr Trump's visit is part of a multi-country campaign to win the 1,237 delegates he needs to win the Republican contest in Indiana. Mr Trump says he will campaign in Ohio as well as Pennsylvania and North Carolina. The results of that campaign will be announced on 11 November. The Republican front runner has made rallies in all four states. On Saturday, he made a rally in Indiana and held a rally in North Carolina. Mr Trump's campaign chairman spent the weekend in Ohio campaigning for Mr Kasich. Campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said the campaign was putting a lot of effort into reaching out to the undecided voters in Ohio. ""We're going to stay with Mr Kasich as long as we can,"" he said. Mr Trump has also made a campaign stop in Pennsylvania, where he will meet voters at a farm. He's scheduled to sit down with voters in Dayton later on Saturday. The outcome of the election will be decided at a Republican Party convention on 7 September. Mr Trump's campaign has hired a wide variety of staff, including advisers, legal experts and even professional political operatives. Mr Trump is also being courted by wealthy Republican donors. A conservative super PAC, Priorities USA, is said to be planning to spend $16m on advertising in Ohio. But Mr Trump's decision to visit Ohio is unlikely to help his campaigns financially. It is the first time he has visited a swing state in 10 years. His campaign is expected to spend heavily on advertising in other states ahead of the November 6 election. His campaign has also been targeting Democratic voters, arguing that Mr Trump is a ""basket case"" for Mr Clinton given his record as president. Mr Trump told crowds in Cincinnati that he would meet voters in Cleveland on Friday ""if you vote for me and I win,"" adding: ""If you don't vote for me, you are going to pay a big price."
790,"Do we need more fake holidays? (Opinion) But I do believe that the holiday season has more to do with one thing: a desire for the holiday gift. I think people just want to give them good presents and they want to give it to their children. It's not about the money, it's about the gift. And in this economy, many families are facing hard choices. Some of those choices are not the right choices. The holidays that truly matter: what can they give you for the holidays? (CNN) -- A few years ago I traveled to Turkey and Germany for a family vacation. Many of my friends were there. We were in a nice hotel for a week. They were all so excited that we'd gone. The country I was staying at was fantastic. The people really treated us really well. They were welcoming. Some of my friends were out. I never see the people that normally check in the airport. I never see the people that are waiting to be put through security by baggage handlers. I never see people that are waiting to get through the security without any sort of identification. I can only think that maybe it's because I am a Muslim. I would have loved to go to Turkey and Germany during the holidays and it was great to see all the people. I love the country, but I have to say that this is a difficult time for my family right now. We are trying to do our best for our children. I do know that it's hard to be a successful person and a good person. But I do believe that today, our children deserve to be able to enjoy a holiday and to do good, so I will do my best to make that happen for them. When they are given something, they deserve it. Yes, my family is strong, but I can't make everyone happy. It breaks my heart that my children can't receive the same gift I gave them that I gave them. It breaks my heart that my children cannot receive the same gift that I gave them. It breaks my heart that even with all the hard work and effort we make, this is going to cause a lot of pain and hardship. So this is no time for me to waste. I want to get this work done as quickly as possible. I want to go back to school and come back to playing basketball again, but I don't know how. I hope that the world can see we are doing something good."
791,"Is the First Amendment safe from Donald Trump? Trump's attacks on the First Amendment are divisive. He may be an unconventional public figure, but his rhetoric is divisive and unsettling, and he has long been one of the most vocal and vocal of conservatives. But last week, for the first time in a while, he was in the mainstream for his beliefs. It's the latest example of Trump's divisive rhetoric at odds with those of the rest of the Republican Party. On Wednesday, Trump said that he would not let the NRA ""grab all the guns"" and said they should be ""wiped out,"" an idea the NRA's National Rifle Association has long advocated. How are you supposed to explain what he's arguing? Donald Trump: ""If you listen to his campaign speeches, they're really just what we'd look at"" Since the beginning of his administration, Trump has attacked every aspect of the U.S. Constitution, even policies that protect American workers. He's previously advocated for stricter gun control, and criticized the Federal Communications Commission for moving ahead with its plan to cut the number of television stations. He has also called for eliminating environmental regulations, which is a popular point of view among many conservatives. But Trump has since said he will not allow the FCC to ""grab all the guns and put them out like foxes,"" a suggestion that would make it harder for him to do his work. So what does the First Amendment guarantee? One of the strongest arguments for protecting the First Amendment is its protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, and it's one that can also be used as a weapon against people who are not armed. In one of Trump's more recent tweets, he called for a ""total and complete shutdown"" of the federal government at midnight on Sunday. That tweet was quickly condemned, as was one Trump himself made a day after his election, which argued that the Second Amendment protected gun rights. This tweet is at odds with Trump's pledge to fight illegal immigration. So what does the First Amendment guarantee? The First Amendment protection to be defended by the Constitution is one of the most fundamental parts of our rights. It's not unconstitutional for the government to search for and search someone for anything - including guns - and then ask them to remove it from their possession. It is not unconstitutional to search someone who is not a"

In addition, as more babies enter the world with the help of medical care, they are expected to grow up with less resources, according to the UN Population Division. In addition, while the baby boom will probably end soon, it may not be the last time. According to the UN's Population Division, between 1990 and 2016, an estimated 16 percent of the world's population was born outside the United States. This was the highest rate since 2013, when 30 percent of the world's population was born outside the United States. ""The number of births in the United States and the United States remains relatively small,"" the UNP said in its report. According to its estimates, the United States has 1.2 million births per year, or about one child per woman. In addition, the United States has a significant number of maternal deaths due to the increase in older mothers and the increasing prevalence of diseases, such as HIV / AIDS. The number of babies born in the United States rose by more than 7 percent annually between 1993 and 2013. In 2013, the birth rate increased by about 3 percent a year, and by 29 percent at the end of the year, as more babies were born to women who were less than 40 weeks pregnant. The report states that, by the end of the next several decades, the rate of births would rise by 9 percent a year, or almost half a million births per year. The population of the United States is expected to continue to grow. Although women are expected to stay in the workforce for longer than men with age-related health problems, women will continue to be the primary caregivers to their young children, ""the report states. The percentage of the world's population that will live to 85 years old is projected to increase from 53 percent in 2014 to 63 percent in 2050. In the United States, the ratio is projected to increase from 30 to 37 percent by 2050, and China's share of the population will reach 69 percent by 2050, the report states.

The story is a reflection of President Obama's call for a renewed focus on schooling and the economic struggles of the working class. Citing the federal government's $787 billion stimulus plan, the article takes a look at how the two generations have grown up together in their own way. And, in a sobering reminder of how little American kids know about the consequences of poor housing, the article includes a chapter on the parents of teenagers who have been kicked out of school for being in the wrong class. The article comes at the end of a year where the election in Ohio has led to increased pressure on Republicans to offer higher taxes to shore up the nation's struggling economy. But, it also provides a glimpse at the realities of American middle-class life, which has been in a downturn since the downturn in 2007. To get the piece, we spoke to three families who are struggling to pay back their student loans. They hope the piece will help improve their lives. ""The economy hasn't been as bad as we thought,"" said one of the families. We felt like we had to get out of debt. We felt like our lives weren't getting better. She has been with her family for 15 years. She was kicked out of school because of a misdemeanor for using marijuana. ""We're financially weak and we haven't had as much money as we thought it was going to get,"" said the other woman. We've been a very low-income family for the past 15 years, and we just don't have the support systems we need to manage our money. While it is not easy to take on the financial burden of a student debt, the families say they have been helped by government assistance. It can be difficult for a parent to find the money to continue to provide their children with solid financial education. ""The stimulus deal has been a huge help for us,"" said one of the families. But it's not that easy for the next generation. We're still struggling. It's hard for them to get a degree. We're still struggling to find jobs. We still have to repay our loans.

The average American lives to old age 67, a big increase from the previous study, which found that Baby Boomers who are 75 years old and up to the age of 64 have an average of $84,200 in debt. The baby boomers are not the only ones that are borrowing cash from older generations, with a third saying that they have their own savings account and a quarter saying that they have their own credit card. ""Millennials are increasingly becoming the wealthiest generation in the country,"" said Peter G. Peterson, the chief economist for the Economic Policy Institute, a conservative think tank. They have a lot of savings, but they're not saving for retirement. They are saving for retirement. So when the baby boomers retire, we're going to see a lot of boomers retiring. The baby boomers are the generation with the highest debt, not the baby boomers. And the money they're borrowing from older generations may be a problem, since they are often not paying that back. ""The generation is borrowing more from the baby boomer generation than their parents were paying,"" Mr. Peterson said. In the past, the baby boomer generation was a lot more vulnerable to borrowing money from the baby boomer generation than the current generation. That happened over the last 50 years. The amount of debt a baby boomer can rack up is still a major issue. The same report found that nearly half of millennials can no longer afford college and university, and half have little savings. That means that these baby boomers are mostly not saving for retirement, of course. But they are getting in over their heads."
796,"Bill Clinton: There Are No Great Generations, Just Different Problems He says he's not sure if the United States will ever again get to the point of a great generational race that's been contested for 3,000 years. ""We're going to get there, but we'll have to wait and see,"" he says in an interview with CBS News. He also says he's still a believer in the two major parties ""winning the war"" - or at least, that's what he says he's seen for many decades. ""My view is that it's time to stop trying to think of Great Generations as"" the last great nation, """" Clinton told CBS News' Nancy Cordes on ""60 Minutes."" The U.S. government should ""get back to the days of a time when people believed in a system of government based on people who were elected to office and then elected by the people."" He also acknowledged that he has lost touch with many of his fellow Democrats. ""I haven't been able to see a Democratic Party that is unified on the issues,"" he said. ""I have not been able to see my Republican colleagues who are willing to have a balanced approach on big issues,"" he said. A lot of those folks have lost touch with where the country is in the world, and I think that's a very, very sad thing. Clinton also says he has not been able to reach out to new voters, and that he still hopes and prays for Obama's re-election. ""I think we just have to look around and see what's still possible,"" he said. I think it's important to get to know a lot of people, particularly young people, that have grown up in this country; they're the future of this country. A lot of those are younger people. It's not just about young people, ""he said. Clinton also addressed his criticism of Obama's comments on race during the 2008 Democratic primary, when Obama was still struggling to appeal to black Americans."" Hillary's campaign was saying 'Oh, you can't go with the guy who you know has a very negative view of what the world looks like,' ""he said."" It was like, ""Oh, you know, Hillary's going to tell you she's not going to run for president. 'She didn't. He added:"" I've said that, and I'm not going to do that again. """

798,"An Online Generation Redefines Mourning and Reflection With a Glance at the Debate about Mourning Since the day after the Parkland school shooting, young people around the world have become increasingly aware of the need to respond and, in some cases, start to heal. Since the tragic events that occurred on February 14, some young people in the United States say they are rethinking their grief and the way they look at tragedy, particularly on social media. The hashtag # ThisIsYou is gaining momentum, and as hundreds of people around the globe took part in the ""Dear Them,"" a social media campaign calling for Americans to rethink their grief, some said they were influenced by the hashtag's importance. ""What's the difference between the hashtag"" Dear Them ""and"" You're no cool ""?"" one user asked. ""It's more like"" You're not cool, """" another person wrote. ""It's not cool that you are posting on Facebook all the time,"" a Twitter user continued. The hashtag has been used more than 117 million times on Twitter since Tuesday and some of the participants, like David Ortiz, a San Francisco Giants fan who traveled from Chicago to participate in the event, said the hashtag does not limit them. ""People tend to think of it as a negative thing, we don't think of it that way,"" Mr. Ortiz said on Thursday. But we are saying, we are not a toxic mold. We are not going to change and we are no longer happy to be associated with this. But that is what happens when we have not been able to change and we have to learn to love and forget what's happened. Mr. Ortiz, who has suffered from depression since the shooting, said he was inspired to participate in the campaign after watching photos of the victims of the attack online. ""I just wanted to do what I can to inspire other people to get rid of this,"" said Mr. Ortiz, 22, who is recovering from surgery for a fractured leg. ""I'm walking, not talking,"" Mr. Ortiz added. I'm walking up to my wheelchair, and I'm walking. I'm walking up to my wheelchair, and I'm walking.

799,"Generation X Is Sick of Your Bullshit, Too WASHINGTON (AP) - The president of America's major stock index, Warren Buffett, said today that the people who invest in stocks are sick of the people getting fat. ""You have a bunch of people who want to get fat,"" Mr. Buffett told a lunch of the Investor Education Trust, an investment adviser and mutual fund company. It's not their fault. They're just sick of it and you've got to do something about it. Mr. Buffett also said that the people who invest in stocks are ""just dumb."" But, he added, ""you've got to be sick of it, too."" ""Wall Street is sick of being fat,"" Mr. Buffett said. They're sick of people getting fat. He said he and his fellow investors were always on the lookout for bargain prices in markets. ""If they went down, it would be a shock, no doubt,"" Mr. Buffett said. I mean, I'm not a big fan of fat. I just don't think it's necessary. And, he said, ""people who want to get fat are a lot better off going into a big bear market."" ""We're definitely saying we want to buy companies that have a lot of bargains and who are paying a lot of interest,"" Mr. Buffett said. We're not buying them. We're buying companies that have a lot of bargains and have a lot of cash flows. Mr. Buffett, who said that he did not believe in buying stocks that borrow money, said that for years, the stock market had been a safe haven like gold. ""The market was very stable,"" he said. We're not going to get into an investment bubble. Instead, he said, the stock market is in an inflated period. ""That puts us in a position where we face the possibility of a recession,"" he said. We will have to cut back on our investment because we have a very high population. The president, who has estimated that the stock market will be worth $3 trillion, said that he was worried about the stock markets, but that they would not ""get out of control."" ""You won't get out of control if you're a wealthy person,"" Mr. Buffett said. You will. You'll be in a position to survive if you've got money to invest. You'll be in a position to take advantage of low interest rates."

801,"My argument with Justice Antonin Scalia (Opinion) The ruling was greeted by applause from both sides of the right, even if it was interpreted by many to be a recognition that the individual mandate issue was settled. But the case was significant, too, because it had the potential to affect a broader range of legal issues, both for the individual and for the health care system. Today's ruling was significant because it reached a broader range of issues and reaffirmed the Constitution. Republicans had argued that the mandate violated the American Constitution's prohibition against unreasonable interference with the legislative branch. The case was closely watched by conservatives because of the impact it could have on the legislative branch, especially the House and Senate. The majority opinion noted that the mandate had to be unconstitutional to survive. I was struck by the fact that the president argued that it was a constitutional right to impose a constitutional obligation on every individual to have preventive health care. For him, the mandate was a constitutional right. But this was made clear in his previous statements on the Constitution and was the result of the fact that the federal government was not compelled to recognize the law's requirement that all citizens buy insurance or pay a fine. In the past, liberal groups like the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society have argued that the federal government had abused its power by requiring individuals to have coverage. Now the administration has said the mandate is constitutional. The case has also been a topic for discussion among some other judges in the Court of Appeals. The Justice Department has a separate lawsuit pending against the mandate and has already reached settlements with some other groups, including the New York Times, over the reporting of the mandate. The issue is not the only one that will be addressed in the coming term of the court this term. The other two cases will be decided on several occasions, but they will be decided separately. While the Court of Appeals will be more interested in this issue than the individual mandate case, the justices see this as not a minor issue, because the mandate is constitutional. The President is asking the Supreme Court, and the New York Times, to decide this case. The New York Times is hopeful that the Court of Appeals will agree with the New York Times that the mandate is constitutional, and that the individual mandate does not violate the federal constitutional ban on interference with legislative branch power. The case is Theodore Olson v. Sebelius, 13-396."
802,"Dear Ted Cruz... you lost a baby. David was on Trump's radio show promoting his upcoming legislation. The Texas senator did not stop blaming the president.'The bombshell that I received this phone call from Donald Trump on Friday was the one about his birth certificate, 'Cruz said.'The Facts of Donald Trump's life story do not reflect the kind of character or perspective that I believe and I pray that he will be at peace with the citizenry of the United States of America.' Cruz said in a tweet that Trump said last week during the bitter campaign that he was' going to terminate my guarantee that we would keep the pledge. 'Trump has since reignited the pledge once more, but on Wednesday Trump indicated he might not keep the pledge. He told The New York Times:' We have been working on that. 'Trump told Fox and Friends the next day:' I don't believe that it's the job of the president to have me terminate my guarantee. ''Anybody who's been working on that for over a year and a half - you know, I'm going to terminate that,' he said. I want to give the American people the benefit of the doubt, but also the opportunity to see the future. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said last week that he intended to run for re-election if the Republicans do not nominate a viable alternative. There was speculation that he would use the threat of a primary challenge to fuel a general election campaign that he would not accept. That would leave the door open for other Republicans to jump in.'Going forward, I'm going to make my decision based on what I think is best for the country, 'Bush said in a statement released by the Bush presidential campaign.'It's a decision that will have the benefit of a lot of discussion and discussion.' The former president said that he would 'absolutely' consider running for re-election if he weren't the 'conventional Republican nominee.''I have been endorsed by a lot of people in the Republican Party, 'he said. Even though Donald Trump will be our party's nominee in November, I believe the support of the people of the United States will be crucial to our success.''We plan to win, 'he said.'I am honored to be the one to lead this party, and I am grateful and honored to serve in the Senate as President of the United States.'"

804,"Goodbye to 'he' and 'she' and hello to 'ze'? By Michelle Andrews Monday, February 24, 2011; 2: 03 PM A couple of years ago, an old friend of mine from elementary school said that we'd had a relationship for years... and I wanted to be sure. I knew that if we made love, we'd have a good long-term relationship. I'd take her for a walk on the beach. But I knew that she wasn't a good person. I didn't want it to go that way. That night, I went to bed. My friends were still there, and we were on the beach. I'm not sure if it was the last time we'd ever see each other. We had just gotten married. What we had planned was to go to dinner and have some one-night stands. But I was like, ""What about her, the one?"" When I got home, I went to call my mom, and she said, ""We're still going."" I said, ""I just wanted to stop laughing. I mean, what she said was,"" I'm not sorry. ""I kept saying to her,"" I'm sorry. ""I said,"" I can't stop laughing. ""She said,"" I've been in a relationship for more than two years. ""She looked at me blankly. She said,"" I'm sorry. ""It was the last time we'd ever see each other. I asked her,"" What kind of girl is that? ""She said,"" I think she's a little girl. ""But on the advice of her mother, she decided to stop laughing. She went to school to check on me. I couldn't believe I was that young. I thought,"" Oh, I hope you don't have a heart attack. ""I said,"" I've always wanted to be a nurse. ""I thought,"" This is what I want to do. ""I kept smiling. I didn't want that to happen. I said,"" I want to be a nurse. ""I said,"" I'm a nurse. ""I didn't want to be a woman. She said,"" You shouldn't be a woman. ""I said,"" No, I'm not. I'm not a nurse.

805,"Is it ethical to colonize Mars? (Opinion) The debate has been raging for years. Was it ethical to colonize Mars instead of a small, isolated land? The answer, as the president of NASA said, is yes. ""There are a lot of things our military has been doing before, and we're now seeing some of it,"" said Eric Holthaus, a planetary scientist from California's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, whom the White House is promising to look into. After all, the White House has been pushing for Mars' return since 1948. ""It's what we've been fighting for,"" Holthaus said. This is a question of making it happen. But a lot of those changes were over the years before President Obama became president. ""We've been fighting for the principle that Mars is a place of abundance and we shouldn't be using it as a base for deep space exploration,"" Holthaus said. But it's gone up in the past 10 years or so, and now it's going up again. So, it's not a big deal. It's a big deal. And I don't see it as a conflict. I actually think it's a question of whether a planet is an amazing place. Would it be ethical to colonize Mars? Or would it be a matter of cost? The answer, of course, is no. The Mars Society has said that if the federal government moves forward with a plan to colonize Mars, it would send astronauts to the Red Planet in a bid to establish a permanent presence for the colony. So would such a mission help the nation? ""The answer is no,"" said Paul Murdock, who co-chairs the Mars Society. We have the resources to put humans to Mars and to begin exploring that planet. We have to do what's needed to get there. That's what we're doing now. And in order for the government to do that, it needs to do something, and that's to do it as quickly as possible. And that's what I think it is. You can see the full interview with Eric Holthaus in the video above. More space news on the space station: The space station's current crew includes a Russian cosmonaut, a NASA astronaut and a Canadian astronaut. The crew is scheduled to depart the station on March 31. The space station was built in 1998."

808,"Biden on 'Colbert' -- shockingly frank and noble as he was in his 2008 White House bid - wasn't afraid to point out that his rival Hillary Clinton was a big-ticket name for the nomination.

It's an opportunity to get some real attention to the problems facing this country, which, you know, is a real issue for this country. Well, I think that is really important. Biden, who was in town for his husband's vice presidential campaign, told Colbert that he's been ""very busy"" over the last two years and that he's been able to make some new friends, including some ""of the biggest names in D.C."" He pointed out that, if he's in a position to win the Democratic nomination, he's been able to get to know the big names like Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, and Scott Walker. ""I've been able to negotiate with a lot of the big names,"" he said. But, you know, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and I work with lots of them. It's a nice little group of people that we're in a position to work with. I think what we're doing right now is we're seeing serious, courageous, capable people out there and it's just a matter of time before their numbers and their numbers start to increase. Biden also mocked the ""very high-minded"" young people who were encouraging him to run for president, saying he's got to ""get them out of my head."" ""I'm not stupid,"" he said. I don't mind being smart. I think I ought to have a good idea of what I want to do.... I went to Washington, D.C., on a cruise ship.... I think it's a good idea to do something like that. I think it's a good idea -- the point is, I'm running for president, and I'm not going to settle for being one of you. Colbert interrupted, telling Biden he ""was in China"" and that he and his wife ""love China."" Colbert responded, ""I love China."" The vice president smiled and said, ""That'd be funny."" ""So,"" Colbert said, ""I am running for president."" ""Colbert"" airs tonight at 8 p.m. on Comedy Central."
809,"Zuckerberg's important message on miscarriage Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's response to a question about miscarriage may be his most important post on social networking in one year. ""On Monday, we made an important decision to help people understand how hard it is to conceive,"" he wrote. In fact, it's almost impossible to conceive and I want you to know that we're trying. In a light-hearted way, he thanked his wife, Priscilla Chan, for her public support. He also said he was touched by the outpouring of love and support. Zuckerberg's post inspired an unusually high number of comments on the social network, and it's been shared more than 4,000 times. The response came after a question he posted in February. In the Facebook post, the CEO said the ""news that you have miscarried... was heartbreaking to see."" He said he wanted to hear from people who had miscarried and thanked them for their support. ""Unfortunately, we have not been able to communicate with every single person in the world who has taken this devastating news,"" Zuckerberg wrote. But, I'm sure it was something that you and everyone else who shared their stories would have been grateful for. It's also very important to know that the world is full of laughter and joy and that laughter is an underrated emotion. The post has since been shared over 12,000 times and shared almost 49,000 times. Some Facebook users applauded Zuckerberg's public outpouring of support. ""This is a wonderful thing for me, and for all of us,"" Chan Chan wrote. Thank you for supporting our family and our friends. It's incredible. More than a few people wrote in support of Zuckerberg's kind words. ""I've never seen a more positive and positive response to an important post,"" Facebook user Roxanne wrote.

810,"How outrage over Cecil killing misses the point An angry backlash over the death of Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe has been overshadowed by the fact that the lion had not been killed at all. It's not yet clear whether the hunter was acting in self-defence or following a legal hunting permit. The Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority insists that the hunt was legal. Cecil's killing has sparked outrage in Zimbabwe and outside the country. Cecil's partner was an American dentist, Walter Palmer. He was shot dead by an American hunter on 1 July. They say a GPS collar used to track him has not been recovered. Two Zimbabwean miners were arrested by the US after searching their car for human bones.

811,"Why are so many people running for president? How is Donald Trump's business success driving so many people? Donald Trump is our billionaire president. We asked some of America's most powerful businesswomen to name the reasons why they've made it to the top. Read the full list below. Don't let Trump's business success take up the air of arrogance. He is the real deal. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Don't let Trump's business success take up the air of arrogance. Don't let Trump's business success get in the way of the President's mission. Don't let Trump's ""America first"" push that he can be a ""real leader"" for the country. This is the President that made us all. His first two years in office saw his first tweet. His first tweet would be: Trump is a great American. Trump won the election. That guy is still the President of the United States. This is the President that is going to have his day in court. If our nation is truly led by a leader who has proven that he can transform the world, then things are getting better. If we take care of our country, we will be able to accomplish what President Trump has promised us to do. It's a long road but we're making progress. I don't feel I have to go back and re-evaluate all my opinions, but I do feel I am doing a good job. Trump is also a great businessman. He's not a pushover. In fact, the great thing about Donald Trump is that, unlike many in the business world, he has a very high opinion of reality. When I first met him, he was a pretty down to earth guy. I was really looking for help. I used to read a lot about Trump and I was like ""that's not a lot of people, but it is interesting."" But he has a very strong opinion of this business. And he never talks about politics. He doesn't talk about what he thinks. I think he wants to be the greatest American that the world has ever known. I've known him for years. I taught him a lot about business and he has a big heart and works hard. He never said that he was a politician but he is a businessman himself. We want to help people and I want to encourage people to vote for him. We want to help the country. So I want to help Donald Trump. Donald Trump is a very, very, very good American."
812,"Top CNN op-eds of 2015 (so far) The most controversial Time's Up stories of 2014 (here's a round-up of their most controversial moments) Time's Up is the movement supporting women to ""end the culture of silence."" On Sunday, it was announced that two more women would be joining the Hollywood A-list in making allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein. When Donald Trump won the US election, the New York Times ran a piece headlined, ""The New Yorker's cover story"" about abuses at the hands of the Trump campaign and film producer Brett Ratner. This is the moment when the cover featured a quote from the Oscar-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio: ""I'm not saying that things aren't happening, but they are. I don't want to say that. I want to say they're happening. When Harvey Weinstein was accused of rape by more than 20 women, he issued a statement denying the allegations:"" The New York Times is a very sacred institution that should be protected and respected. I believe, and I have told you in no uncertain terms, that our culture of sexual harassment and assault in the workplace is a cancer that has no place in a professional industry. We must dismantle that culture. It's time to stop the culture of silence, and we must do it now. The New York Times was quickly deluged with stories of harassment, rape and sexual harassment. Here are a few of the top stories relating to this year's Time's Up campaign. The hashtag # MeToo was used by hundreds of actresses, as well as athletes and television personalities. Some of these athletes and athletes have accused powerful men of harassment. Women are leading the way in protesting against sexual harassment in every industry. We can all speak up for each other. Women are not afraid to take a stand and this is the moment that we must do it. We can show up to work every day and stand up for our sisters, our sisters. We can fight for our sisters, our daughters, our brothers, our mothers, our sisters, our colleagues, our husbands. We are the ones that will change the world. Actor Vin Diesel, with his wife, actress Reese Witherspoon, right, speaks as he participates in the Time's Up movement at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on November 9, 2018 in Beverly Hills, California. In response, all industries have offered to work with organizations that support women's rights."
813,"Syria crisis: How world should respond (Opinion) It's been more than two years since the Syrian civil war began, but it's still too soon to tell if the conflict is going to be resolved peacefully. Yet there are growing signs of international reaction to the Syrian crisis, and this is one way to begin that process. We look at the reaction by other world powers to President Bashar Assad's resignation. In this video, we ask how do you respond to the Syrian crisis. From Syria To the United States Syria is back. President Assad's resignation is one of the most significant changes we have seen since the Syrian war began. This has made Syria a pariah state, and it's been one of the most divisive issues in the region. Syrian foreign minister Walid al-Moualem met with President Barack Obama on Tuesday. In it, al-Moualem welcomed the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and reaffirmed his country's commitment to a two-state solution. There have been major developments in Syria: In November, Syrian forces retook a key air base outside of the capital, Damascus, from the so-called Islamic State, which had captured it in September, the first time Syrian troops have taken control of an air base in that part of the country outside Damascus since the Syrian war began. The last time the United States recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital was in 1967, when President John Kennedy recognized it as the capital of Israel. Obama has made clear that U.S. support for establishing peace talks with the parties to the conflict is conditioned on the resumption of negotiations with the Syrian government. Since the beginning of the Syrian conflict in March 2011, there have been a total of 250,000 Syrians who have fled the country. During the past two years, the Arab Spring uprisings have brought down regime leaders in Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen. But, as the Syria crisis is entering its third year, the Syrian conflict is far from over. CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.

814,"Why can't America have high-speed trains? That's one suggestion from a report from the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, that recommends overhauling the way we operate and investing in new technology, to keep pace with the changing needs of the 21st century. The GAO's report looks at how the nation's railroads fared in recent years - many of the issues it examined involve new technologies and how those technologies might be developed or deployed. The GAO says that the railroads are working to improve safety and reliability. But their reliability is being put at risk by technology that can't be easily patched. For example, the Railroad Research and Development Authority, or CRDDI, is not readily able to predict an impact and how many trains will be needed. ""CRDDI is not adequately prepared for the challenges of future challenges,"" the report found, ""and it lacks the technology and training that is necessary to address these issues."" The rail industry also lacks a clear understanding of how to deliver the railroad's core technology, which is the railroad's reliability. According to the report, the railroad has only had one train from its manufacturing line, CT-1, since 2003, and CT-1 has been in service since 1981. The CRDDI report recommends that the CRDDI develop an automated system that would automatically update and retrofit an aging track. ""The CRDDI is not the solution,"" said RMS Transportation Director Eric Ferras in a prepared statement. CRDDI has proven to be a costly failure. CRDDI is the right solution. The CRDDI report is available now on the GAO website. The CRDDI report was prepared by the Department of Transportation's Office of Inspector General, headed by the GAO's John B. Bellinger. The report is available on the Department's website, www.gao.gov / investigations.

815,"The marriage apocalypse may be coming (Opinion) LONDON -- The divorce rate will be about half the rate of today's. But the marriage rate will be lower than that of 1964, the year after President John F. Kennedy nominated Robert F. Kennedy to the U.S. Senate. The ""dire economic and financial conditions"" of today's world were highlighted in a report published Monday by the Pew Research Center. And there is plenty of evidence to support the notion that the nation is heading for a divorce. The researchers examined the U.S. divorce rate from 1968 to 2007. They found that the divorce rate was nearly double the rate of the previous decade, when the divorce rate was 21 percent for women. The divorce rate for men actually fell from 20.7 percent in 1968 to 19.6 percent in 2007. The economists who created the data used a median of nearly 200 previous divorces to compare the numbers with those of the other three sources: the Census Bureau, the Pew Research Center and the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey. The study was based on records of nearly 244,000 households. The Pew Research Center says the divorce rate for women in the first three months of 2007 was 17.5 percent, compared with 15.2 percent for men. One reason the divorce rate may be lower than the median was that the number of divorces for women went up, while the number of divorces for men went down. One reason is that the divorce rate for men in the previous year was higher, the study says. ""The divorce rate for women rose from 2.1 percent to 3.8 percent in the second quarter of 2007, compared to 2.7 percent for men,"" the study says. The divorce rate for men in the first three months of 2007 was also higher -- from 1.9 percent to 2.2 percent -- than for women in the previous year. The researchers also found that the divorce rate for men and women of the same age ranged from 4.6 percent to 5.4 percent. The divorce rate for men in the same age range was 0.6 percent. The study also found that only 7.4 percent of the 45.6 million Americans who were in the marriages before 1987 (those with a bachelor's degree) lived with their spouse and were married or living together. The divorce rate for men was 1.9 percent. All About Marriage • The John F. Kennedy Library Foundation • National Economy • Divorce"

For more information, read the full text of the book. The book reveals that as a child, she was a Christian until she was about 12, when she converted to Judaism. She would go to school and then study in California, eventually converting to Islam, becoming a nun. She attended her first Pentecostal church when she was 8. Her mother, Mary, was a Pentecostal minister and member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She had told her sisters about Jesus' birth, but her sister at the time told her that she wanted to marry her boyfriend. She was born in California, but she became a Christian in order to marry the man of her dreams. The book reveals that she moved to Texas to live with her sister but that she abandoned Christianity at 14 -- an experience she describes in the novel's title as ""a dark and torrid time."" It also reveals that during the early years of her life, she taught hymns and met and married a man named John, whose family allowed her to study in Texas. She later converted to Judaism and married John again. The book also reveals that she was raped by a neighbor at age 5. She told her mother and her sisters that she was raped by John seven years later. While the book explores Jesus ""birth and his marriage to Mary, it also has a lot of new material -- and lots of new people to talk about.

817,"Nudity doesn't shock us anymore, say academics She added: ""A report by the Children's Society, published last year, that revealed the shocking extent of sexual violence against girls aged 11-14 in the UK and Ireland, was a catalyst for a culture shift."" The report said: ""The public's desire for young girls to be brave, confident, stylish and attractive grows, and the media's relentless coverage of such crimes, however, has led to a number of perpetrators remaining unpunished."" While parents are encouraged to be cautious when talking about the dangers of sex, the report continues: ""[T] he young person's sexuality and gender can have significant implications for their mental health and for their ability to succeed in school and work. The research also highlights the need for teachers and parents to talk about appropriate sex education, to ensure young people in schools and in the community are not afraid of speaking out. The report states:"" Teachers are advised to encourage young people to speak out about sexual assault and other inappropriate behaviour and to report such incidents. ""Helen Wilkinson, Professor of Criminology at the University of Bristol, who led a study into sexual violence in schools, welcomed the report. She said:"" Sexual violence is still completely taboo, yet for too long, the issue is a silent epidemic. Young people want to be seen for who they are - in the media and in the homes they live in, and not as victims. She added: ""Schools must also be taught about the dangers of sexual violence, including the insidious effect on young people's personal safety."" Another study, published last year, found that one in 20 girls experience attacks by a partner at school. It also found that one in five victims still experience assault from another person when they are in the position of marriage or if they know of an abuse from a previous partner. In the US, more than 80 per cent of schools report that they receive reports of sexual abuse from students aged 14 to 17. But in Britain, only 6 per cent of schools report sexual harassment from students aged 7-15. The survey of more than 5,700 British schools found that 13 per cent did not record the number of sexual violence cases reported to police. In the US, 23 per cent of schools report a total of 12 student sexual assault cases annually. The report was conducted by the New York State Office of the Child Study."
818,"Why more women choose not to marry, reports have found - RT UK News Published time: 22 Aug, 2017 19: 32 Women are choosing to marry in the age of austerity, according to the latest report from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). While the number of homebuyers has dropped for the first time in seven years, women are still choosing to marry, it has emerged. They are becoming more comfortable in this country's politics and economy. Women are accepting that the option of choosing to marry is being allowed to stay, ""said ONS assistant statistician Helen Dickinson. The figures show young women are far more likely to marry. Of those who say they have chosen to marry, 13 percent are in their 20s, while almost one in five are in their 40s.

820,"Do You Use CBD Oils for Your Child? Here Are the CBD's Most Popular CBD Oils: New York City Oils CBD CBD Oils May Not Be Cool Can you find the best way to keep your baby safe while using BD Oils? The research shows that some of the most popular products for kids can contain dangerous levels of BPA, a chemical that can contribute to birth defects, cancer and other health problems. The best way to avoid BPA is to limit exposure to it. In a recent study, scientists at the University of Leeds found that children who consumed more than one container of BPA daily were more than four times less likely to have a birth defect than children who consumed only one container. In the United States, BPA is used in everything from paper towels to furniture. It is also found in a variety of other consumer products, like detergents, body washes and toothpaste. BPA in cosmetics is found in most household products, including hand sanitizers, food containers, clothing and infant formula. It is also found in many foods, including vegetables, fruit, nuts, seeds and seafood. How can BPA be found in your baby? Here are the top 10 common CBD oils. CBD Oils, on the other hand, are largely found in a variety of household products, including paper towels, food containers, clothing and infant formula. The products use BPA in many industrial products, including food, cleaning products, and home furnishings. The American Chemical Society has set a limit on BPA in baby products. However, it recommends that babies younger than 4 years old use only 1 ounce in BPA daily. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has no age limit for BPA in baby products. However, it recommends that infants younger than four years old use zero in BPA on their birth control. The American Academy of Pediatrics has no age limit on BPA in baby products. At least 10 of the 25 states and the District of Columbia have no age limit for BPA. See more news stories on BPA.

Lauren's daughter is a girl, however. Another girl with MS is also a girl. In a previous episode, Lauren and another girl spent some time together, but Lauren said she thought her son didn't want to date her. Lauren said that she wanted to ask her son and he refused, but he eventually convinced her that he wanted to date her. ""He really did want to date me,"" Lauren said. I just wanted to try to get him to tell me that he loves me. In the end, Lauren and her daughter got a date, and Lauren said she thinks Lauren is ""more confident than I am now.""

822,"We Want to Hear Your Tiny Victories A man and his 11 children walk to the parade grounds after the parade in Athens, Greece, Saturday, June 10, 2012. Greeks are hoping to see their country become a more prosperous and successful country after elections last month. AP Photo / Petros Giannakouris (CBS / AP) A day after Greeks celebrated the end of the country's economic crisis, a lot of children are still waiting for their parents to come home. The Associated Press reports that Greeks are hoping for a return of a nation that has changed in an extraordinary way - by itself. With a growing economy, a rising middle class and a highly educated population, Greece has grown from one of the largest countries in the world to the fourth-largest economy in the world. That's why some feel their country has finally found its way back from the economic doldrums that followed the country's 2008 financial crisis. ""The biggest and most iconic part of our country was that we returned to the future,"" said Alexander Nagy, the country's sociologist who teaches at Athens University. I think this country has come back. The Associated Press is still assessing the extent of the nation's dependence on the European Union. The Greek government has been trying to turn its economy around thanks to a euro110 billion ($150 billion) rescue package that has saved the nation from bankruptcy. The bailout will be discussed Sunday in parliament, and the Greek government hopes to use Tuesday's meeting to push through the rescue package. The country's finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, said Greece's bailout plan will allow Greece to continue its economic growth, and Greece will be able to continue offering loans. Varoufakis said he is hopeful the plan will be approved, but he had nothing to add to the story. ""It is the government's responsibility to manage the economy,"" he said. On Monday, Varoufakis said he was optimistic that his country's rescue package would be approved. If the Greek government wants to implement the rescue package, he said, it will need to negotiate a new deal with the IMF that will provide less bailout money. The money lenders agreed to the deal are asking Greece to cut its interest rates by 25 percent and to implement a new austerity program. The agreement would also allow Greece to continue paying back its debts, but Varoufakis said that these negotiations would only be successful if Greece fulfilled those targets."
823,"Congress Nears Stimulus Deal With White House as Wall Street Suffers Rout The financial markets are rallying again, but their mood is a bit jittery. Some of the worst stories of the past week have been caused by financial companies that are suffering the worst drops in share prices in the past years. As a result, many analysts are saying that investors should be nervous. But, according to the Wall Street Journal, one member of Congress has decided to put a new twist on the traditional explanation of how markets are doing. A congressman is proposing a bill that would put a stop to hedge funds and other money market funds that are betting against stocks, according to the New York Times. The bill is called the ""Dodd-Frank Act"" and would require financial institutions to disclose to the public that they have a large amount of capital invested in the securities they buy. It would also require them to disclose that their money is placed in the fund. The bill is backed by two other members of Congress: Representative Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas. Wall Street has been rallying on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq leading the way. Analysts had expected the slump in stocks to continue, with some saying the market could even rally. But, as The Wall Street Journal reported, in the last few days, some hedge funds have been feeling relatively pessimistic about the prospects for the economy. ""It's not as if investors think the economy will recover quickly or continue to grow quickly,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase. Mr. Feroli said the market did not need to worry about the specter of a recession. ""There's no reason to panic,"" Mr. Feroli said. We've been pumping money into the system. If we do get a downturn, that's a sign that we're approaching a recession. That's why the market should be nervous. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down less than 1 percent on Wednesday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq Composite was off 0.1 percent.

824,"The President as Bystander: Trump Struggles to Unify a Nation on Edge of Climate Change Washington Post-Poll Polls show Donald Trump is leading Democrats by 8 points nationwide, more than ever before, and that the public is split on policies ranging from climate change to income inequality to the war in Syria. And he has a working relationship with the progressive left, too. The President's approval rating has hit an all-time low. In his March ""America First"" speech, he said the United States would not be ""defined by how many people we have in this country who are horrible,"" but rather by how much they ""love us."" He had made similar comments when he was in the Oval Office. But the news also came on the same day that the New York Times reported that the White House was thinking of pushing legislation to reduce carbon emissions, though the White House has not yet put forward a specific proposal. In the Post-Poll, 46 percent of voters said that Trump represented them well or fairly. And most of Trump's supporters also said the President represented them well or fairly, though more than two-thirds said that they did not know enough about him to truly know him. Nearly two-thirds said that Mr. Trump represented them well or fairly, even if they did not know him personally. ""The President is a good candidate for the presidency and he is going to be a good president if he's able to shape the country's course forward,"" said John Feehery, director of the Public Religion Research Institute. What's different here is that much of the criticism of Mr. Trump has originated from a fear that he will be too weak to be president. That fear has been reinforced by his own personal approval ratings: That has fallen from 60 percent in May 2015 to 41 percent in May 2016, according to a survey by Quinnipiac University. That assessment suggests that the president simply does not have the political capital to deliver on his campaign promises. Voters also believe that Democratic candidates are too liberal and too conservative, the poll found. Mr. Feehery conducted the poll in April, shortly before he announced his bid for the 2020 election. He was candid in his analysis. ""The American people are tired of the Republican Party and of the president,"" he said. There is no future for the President. Now they are fed up with the White House. To me, it is a big deal."

Under Louisiana law, candidates must file certified signatures of voter registration to have a chance of winning.

The race for the Senate, which will hold the Republican primary on May 15, will be carried over from the general election. Though the state has never held a primary before, the Democrats are hoping to claim a strong victory. While those are still trying to figure out how their candidates will respond to the deadline, there could be a large number of votes for Republicans. The Republican Party is spending millions to try to win back some of the Republican voters that the party lost in the 2008 presidential election. The state's primary is one of six in the state, with the most competitive elections being held on Tuesday. The other two are among two other states on April 25. The largest primary in the 2016 race was held in February, when Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton defeated Republican Senator John McCain. Ms. Clinton prevailed over Mr. McCain by about 2,700 votes, but Mr. Obama polled ahead in the governor's race by about 5,000 votes. The Democratic primary was held in May, when Senator John Kerry, the Republican candidate, lost by about 12,000 votes. In the general election, the candidates will face off in the primary on May 22, with Mr. Kerry winning by a landslide. The Democratic primary will be held on May 22 in Louisiana.

826,"Afraid of Coronavirus? That Might Say Something About Your Politics One might imagine that the only way to prevent the Acute Respiratory Syndrome (ARS) virus emerging from the United States is to fight it by keeping it inside the home. But today, one scientist has revealed something else that could cause problems for you in the future, according to the New York Times. Dr. Lance Redford, a professor in the Department of Epidemiology at Columbia University, is concerned about the potential for more outbreaks of the virus in the United States. ""I think the American people need to be aware of that,"" he told the Times. If they have AApoE, it gives them a little bit more confidence that they're not going to get sick. Redford's fears about the virus appear to come from a study published in the journal PNAS on December 17. While researchers at Columbia University analyzed the genetics of the virus, they found that the mutations that make the gene responsible for the virus are not limited to humans but also influences the genes of all animals. The study, published in PNAS, analyzed 32,343 chromosomes from 22 human and 81 animal species. The AAApoE mutation is responsible for the number of cases of the virus in the U.S. According to the researchers, ""a significantly increased number of patients with AApoE mutations have been reported in the United States than previously reported."" Read More: Are AApoE Mutations Enough to Save You From Coronaviruses? The results suggest that the mutations could be responsible for the large number of people who have been infected with the virus in the U.S. So far, at least 340 cases of the virus have been reported in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are currently currently 1,408 people infected with the virus in the U.S., according to the CDC. A similar number of people are getting infected with the AAApoE mutation. Many of those infected have been unable to fight off the virus, according to the National Institutes of Health. The World Health Organization claims that the risk of contracting the virus from a person who has the AAApoE mutation is 25 percent. It is not clear how many people will contract the virus.

The group says it is also establishing a research group to look at the possibility that the universe is in trouble. The latest event takes place in the Midwest near the Canadian border. ""We're ready to move forward,"" said Steven Cederberg, the ALICE director. We may have to do it later. The scientific community has been warning for some time that there is a real possibility that the universe is on a collision course with us. This is one of the greatest threats to humanity. Scientists at the Idaho Department of Technology held a teleconference in October to discuss the possibility of the universe collapsing. The teleconference, titled ""The Future of the Universe,"" showed that many scientists thought the dark matter cloud, or dark energy, was hiding something, but eventually found it. In the conference, Idaho State University's Paul Weyant and NASA's Neil deGrasse Tyson said they believe the exotic cosmic microwave background could be a bright, solid source of energy that is not reflected as much in space as it is in our galaxy. Scientists previously found stars in the Milky Way that, like other stars, could be capable of producing cosmic radiation. The ALICE project is studying the phenomenon in hopes of finding out if the universe is a solid, liquid or solid. It is led by the institute and the University of Idaho. The society says it has received private funding from private universities and other sources. The society is seeking the public's support for the project by asking people to fill out a survey."
829,"Trump Administration Moves to Speed Coronavirus Testing New vaccines and vaccines against the common coronavirus have been available for years. But the new vaccines are being tested in the lab and may be made available as early as this fall. The new research is a big milestone in the fight against this illness, which can cause severe illness that kills nearly 1 million Americans each year. The vaccine was developed by scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has estimated that up to 90 percent of the world's population will be infected by the disease. In response to that threat, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began targeting new vaccines. It made national measles vaccination inserts available to patients in 2014 when a $5 billion global effort was launched. The vaccine contains a live virus vaccine, which is generally only available at hospitals that receive outbreaks. The vaccine can be given in the case of a hospital outbreak, though it is also available to those who are vaccinated with other diseases such as measles. The new vaccines are also expected to speed up the development of a new set of medicines, which can potentially prevent a potentially fatal disease. New vaccines will be tested first this fall for protection against the new virus. These may be available early next year, if the new vaccine is approved by the FDA, CBS News' Margaret Brennan reports. The results of the new research were presented this week at the British Academy of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. ""We've been doing this for years and years now,"" said Dr. Christopher R. Brown, of the CDC, a leading authority on the disease. We've been waiting for this to happen for a long time. This is the first step. They've got to move quickly: ""You've got to get this ready early."" ""Coronaviruses are a common cause of severe illness, with some 2 million cases reported to the CDC each year."" It's a major public health problem, ""Brown said. It's a global issue. It's going to take a lot of work. CBS News' Vladimir Duthiers contributed to this report. The CDC's new vaccine is FDA-approved.

830,"China Spins Tale That the U.S. Army Started the Coronavirus Epidemic in 1918 and Won the Second Congressional Gold Medal in 1924. But the outbreak also affected the National Press Club. This is not to say that China's inaction will not be reflected in an even bigger discussion about the American wars. But a new study published in Current Biology - a government-sponsored peer-reviewed journal - argues that the Chinese government may be too slow to react. ""Although China's military involvement in World War II was relatively limited, the impact of the H1N1 virus has affected both the United States and the world,"" the authors write in the paper, ""and a much larger number of people have died from the virus."" Some of the more prominent details in the paper are that China had the ""highest number of confirmed cases"" of H1N1 ""in North America,"" as well as the highest number of fatalities. ""Overall, the report points out, the Chinese military has contributed"" more than $2 trillion to the global burden on the global economy since the inception of the Global Health Emergencies Act in 2001. """" This is not just about China's military involvement in World War II but also about the U.S. and the E.U. ""s role in providing humanitarian assistance to the region, and in particular humanitarian assistance to the Philippines in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan"" in 2013. The authors say that while Chinese officials have been extremely reluctant to release more information about the H1N1 outbreak, they have made it clear that they would like to publicize the cases. Mr. Wu said he thought China was making progress. ""We are seeing a gradual decline in cases since the beginning of this year,"" he told the World Journal. We think it will be relatively easy for us to make full use of the international system to pinpoint the specific numbers of people infected, and we hope the international community will continue to cooperate on this. The report said that ""we believe that China's inaction will affect the global system, as well as the U.S. effort to prepare it for the expected new influenza pandemic."" The World Health Organization said last month that the H1N1 virus, one of the major global health threats in recent decades, killed an estimated 1,266 people in 2013. Doctors Without Borders said the toll was ""significantly higher"" than the official death toll."

The president, who has been accused by many Republicans of undermining the judiciary, incorrectly characterized his secretary of state, Heather Kiriakou, as"" not so great, ""the New York Times reported Thursday, citing a redacted version of a transcript of the hearing. The Times also quoted a Justice Department spokeswoman as saying that the department was"" not aware of any wrongdoing ""related to the surveillance program and that the president was"" aware of the process. ""The transcript, which was obtained as part of a Freedom of Information Act request, provides no new details about the instances in question. But it reveals an awkward exchange between Trump and Kiriakou, who was not selected to the post by President Obama, during her confirmation hearing in July. Asked by a Senate aide why she should be chosen for the job, Kiriakou responded,"" Not so great, ""according to the transcript. Trump later commented that he wrongly called her secretary of state, saying,"" Oh it's Hillary. ""Democrats countered that the senator's inconsistencies showed he was using the same language when he said a judge should sit on the Supreme Court. The transcript, which was released in full by the Times, is among more than a dozen documents released by the government alleging that the government has monitored Trump's personal and business affairs for years. The transcript also notes that Kiriakou has repeatedly asked the Justice Department for communications between Trump and his aides, but has received an array of requests for documents. Since the Obama administration began spying on foreign leaders, the Trump administration has engaged in lawsuits against the National Security Agency and the CIA for alleged eavesdropping on foreign leaders' communications. Despite the unsubstantiated allegations, Trump has taken to criticizing the intelligence community for doing so, telling Fox News in July that the intelligence community was"" on the verge of total disintegration.

On Wednesday, the Transportation Security Administration said it would expand the screening program to all cargo to and from the airport, as well as into other airports, including Newark Liberty International Airport and Chicago's Midway Airport. On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security said it is expanding its screening of all passenger baggage to the airports. A representative for the TSA said passengers will be given additional screening and screening options at the airports. The new screening of passenger baggage and passenger food is an update of existing screening procedures. In early March, the TSA said that passengers flying into or out of Kennedy International Airport would not be subject to random screening. The TSA said it is expanding its screening for passengers coming from seven airports to include three additional airports: Newark Liberty International Airport; Chicago's Midway Airport; and Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport. Some passengers who arrive at Kennedy International Airport from New York City are also being tested for the virus. ""We ask that the public continue to follow their airline's screening procedures and take additional steps to prevent the spread of the illness,"" said TSA spokesman Ross Feinstein. The TSA has advised travelers to arrive at the airport at least two hours before their flight.

836,"Pentagon Asks to Reconsider Awarding Huge Cloud Contract to Amazon The Pentagon is asking Amazon to reconsider awarding a huge cloud computing contract that would provide $4.5 billion in services to the Defense Department's Information Technology and Services Organization. Defense Department Deputy Defense Secretary Bill Urban said Monday that the company's decision came as part of an ongoing review of the overall cloud computing market. Amazon won the contract in February. Amazon, which began as an online retailer, has been making investments in cloud computing for more than a decade. The Defense Department's decision follows an unannounced inspection conducted by the Office of Naval Research. The Office of Naval Research, which has been scrutinizing the cloud computing market for several years, did not say how it found the company's decision was unfairly made. Officials said they are still waiting for the results of its review of the contract. Amazon is already involved in a legal battle with the U.S. Justice Department, saying it is overpaying the government. The company has argued that it lost out on the cloud business because the government gave it too much leeway. Amazon could not be reached for comment. The Pentagon said it has no plans to resubmit the awarding. The Pentagon said it still has a ""zero-tolerance policy"" toward such contracts. The contracting process is open to public comment. The Defense Department declined to comment on whether it would review the contract. The department's inspector general last year found that Amazon's decision to award the contract to the Pentagon's Information Technology and Services Organization contradicted Pentagon policy and the Department of Defense's acquisition guidelines. Amazon and several other companies have faced scrutiny over their spending in cloud computing. Amazon announced last week that its cloud service in the United States is now available in more than 400 U.S. cities. The company said it would build an initial nationwide network to handle customers ""requests for data. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the company would have a separate team working on the cloud business. President-elect Donald Trump's campaign has advocated the use of cloud providers to"" deliver the most value ""for the government. Follow @ melmason on Twitter for more Pentagon news.

837,"The New York Times reported on Monday that more than a dozen women have come forward in the past year alleging Cosby sexually assaulted them. They are asking that the accusations be dropped. Cosby has denied the allegations. While the Times report noted that a new accuser has come forward, the New Yorker didn't have an immediate comment. Cosby is scheduled to appear Tuesday in Cleveland, where he's scheduled to speak at the National Association of Black Journalists. Cosby has been accused of drugging and molesting a number of women over the decades, including his former wife, Camille. Some of the most notorious Cosby accusers in the past decade have said they were hoping for a new trial. Others have accused him of failing to report their allegations. Cosby's lawyer, Martin D. Singer, said Monday that he was confident the rape charges against Cosby would be dismissed. He said ""we are very confident that there will be no prosecution."" Singer said that Cosby will be tried in court in Philadelphia, a city well known for its large populations of African-Americans. Cosby has been charged in the past with sexual assault in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and New York. He faces a total of five counts of felony aggravated indecent assault in Pennsylvania, three counts of aggravated indecent assault in Connecticut and one count of felony aggravated molestation in Massachusetts. A judge allowed police to question Cosby earlier this year in Pennsylvania and is scheduled to begin questioning him more frequently at a later date. When he's permitted to be questioned more often, he can be compelled to answer questions, according to the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office. Cosby faces three counts of felony aggravated assault in Pennsylvania for allegedly drugging and molesting Andrea Constand, a Temple University employee who was a former basketball team employee at his alma mater. Constand, now 44, said she met Cosby in 1982 at the Playboy Mansion. When she was 17, she was a junior at the school and Cosby invited her upstairs to dinner, where he used to fondle her breast and watch her undress. She said Cosby tried to kiss her, but she said she ""remembered nothing"" about what happened. Follow Nedra Pickler on Twitter at https: / / twitter.com / nedrapickler.

850,"30 Recipes for Lunch at Home - The New York Times Lunch is a time for a cheat meal. It's what we call ""dinner time."" It's the perfect time to take your mind off the daily grind, drink some water, or browse the Web to get to that evening meal. It's also important to avoid carbs (for example, coffee). But if you do want to eat healthy, order takeout from restaurants with smaller portions. You want your portions filled. For a quick meal, you need to grab a snack. You can only go so far with these three rules: Don't eat too much. Spread a portion of pecans on your plate instead, as above. You can also have more portions than you're used to. But if you're a meat eater, you're not going to enjoy that kind of snack. It's a great way to get carbs, but eating too much of it is better for you. And make sure you are getting the right amount of protein. A breakfast of fried shrimp, spinach, bacon, and eggs are all good sources of protein. When you choose a meal plan, make sure you cut out a couple of calories in what you're eating. You also want snacks, like yogurt, in the morning, too. You don't need to eat to have a good night's sleep. Another important thing to remember is that you will stay up late for breakfast, and you will eat almost as much at the end of the day as you would snack on a normal day. If you eat late and have some fat or carbs in your diet, you can eat when many people are around. If you feel hungry, you may not eat breakfast. If you fall asleep at night, you may not eat breakfast at all. A good meal is better for you than a bad meal. For a healthful dinner, eat more protein like eggs or fish, and have a little bit of sodium. A good breakfast can also help you sleep better than a good meal. If you're trying to lose weight, try to lose some weight, including your waist circumference. Studies show that your body weight is more sensitive to insulin, a hormone that helps regulate appetite and appetite. A good breakfast also keeps you alert and can help control blood sugar levels.

Some Iranian dishes, such as pasta and salad, are also called Nowruz; you'll hear it in the Persian language. I love to make pasta and salad, but it's not as easy as other dishes. For the Persian New Year there will be pasta and salad, and another main dish will be pasta with spicy sauces and other spices. Some dishes can be pretty traditional and some will be very traditional, like chili, cress and garlic. It's possible to play Nowruz in different ways, and it is a different way of cooking nowruz. You can use lots of spices and you can make lots of pasta. I like to make miso soup, which is like a small bowl of pasta, or pasta with vegetables. Nowruz is a traditional Persian dish that I can make with food. It's good for the soul, because you don't want to go into a restaurant and be hungry. It's like the same food every day. This is a lot of pasta. I'm not a big fan of eating with food, but I like to have something that I can eat with vegetables and with fresh vegetables. Nowruz is really easy, and I like to make it with lots of vegetables. I like to eat a lot of things that I love. Nowruz is a hot meal in Iran. You're not allowed to have dessert - it's not supposed to be cold. It's cold, so it's not supposed to taste like a savory food. What are the ways you can make nowruz in Iran? I like to cook with wood-fired stoves so they're better for cooking, and maybe roast chicken and rice. Nowruz is a good dish to cook, because you can make it in the savory way with vegetables and chicken or rice. You can use meat or meat-based dishes, and you can use meat, fish, and vegetables. It's just a different process. It's very simple and is very quick."

Instead, use a recipe from the National Federation of Independent Business and you'll have your pantry ready by the end of January. Make sure to include the following tips: When you're preparing the pantry: Make sure to include the following ingredients. The oven should be turned off. Place the oven in a warm place, which should be covered, and keep the oven off most of the time, and use oven clocks that are slightly higher than 375 degrees. To make the sauce: In a large bowl combine the chopped red onions, garlic, chile and ginger, and the mustard seeds, ginger, chile powder, and lemon juice to taste. Stir in the egg yolks, salt, and pepper. Mix well, and bring into the oven. Leave to stand for about 9 minutes, until the sauce is thickened. To make the sauce: Pour the sauce over the pantry and let it cool. The sauce should be very thick, and no more than 2 cups. I usually put it in a serving bowl, or on a wide pan, so it can be wrapped with some kitchen paper. It will keep for several hours. Remove the pantry and leave the pan to soak in the vinaigrette, then strain. Once the sauce has cooled, put the pantry back in the oven for another 15 minutes, until the sauce is very thickened and the sauce has thickened. Once the sauce is ready, put the sauce back in the oven and let it cool. Season with salt and pepper. The sauce should be thick, and the vinaigrette should be crisp and light.

The first of ""The Pot Quiz: Five New Ideas You Should Try to Use to Succeed"" (Sunday Styles) gives you a few tips to use in order to improve your poker game. As for trying to produce a good recipe for a pot of your choice, here are some useful tips that you can use: Cut the pot into quarters. Brush the holes with water, then add the seeds to the pot. Add the seeds to the pot and put the pot into the pot. Add a little salt and sugar, if using, and add a little sugar. Taste it and add water. Continue to add water constantly to make sure that the water stays at a constant level. Add the leaves. If possible, add a little water to the pot and add some salt to it. Add the sugar to the pot and keep going until it's all added. Add the rice to the pot. If you are trying to make a pot the same as if you were adding a protein powder or some other protein powder, add a little more salt and sugar. Pour in the water. When the water runs dry and if it doesn't have any liquid, add a little more water and gradually reduce the volume until the water has lightened. Remove the pot from the pot and add to the pot and add more water. If you are using the pot as a poker tool, add a few seeds and a little salt to the pot. Then add some sugar and the seeds. Pour the pot into the bottom of the pot, cover it with a piece of paper and pour it over the pot. Finally, pour a little more water into the pot and cover with a piece of cloth. Keep pouring the water into the pot until the liquid is evaporated. Next time you are pouring into the pot, turn off the light and pour in the water. Once the water runs out, use a spatula to make the pot a little thicker. Use a paper towel to remove the plastic covering of the pot and fill with water. This will release the water. The water will not be diluted. The pot will be a little smaller than the pot."

855,"Coronavirus Live Updates: Trump to Declare National Emergency and Louisiana Will Delay Primary WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump said Tuesday that his administration would delay a decision on whether to declare a national emergency in Louisiana until next week. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said that he would sign an executive order formally declaring a state of emergency in the affected areas as early as Tuesday. ""It's time to get the facts,"" Mr. Price said of the declaration. The declaration would allow federal aid to remain in place for the state until a designated recovery area is established in a state that has suffered widespread flooding. Mr. Trump on Tuesday urged governors to follow his lead and delay a decision on whether or not to call for federal aid. ""If there's no federal aid, I won't be doing it,"" he said. I'll be talking to people. The declaration would remain in effect, but state officials had not yet decided where to put it. Mr. Trump, who has vowed to declare a state of emergency in Texas and California if the situation worsens, said in a statement he was sending an executive order to the departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services to provide his ""full support."" ""Louisiana is a disaster zone,"" Mr. Trump added, ""and we are going to do everything possible to respond to this disaster."" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said he had told the president that he planned to issue an executive order to declare a state of emergency. In a statement, Mr. Abbott said he was ""ready to take our full support of the federal government to Louisiana."" The declaration would be the first by a federal executive director in a president's first month in office, according to a spokesman for the North Carolina Republican, Mark Meadows. In a sign of the fragility of the response to the Louisiana flooding, the White House said Mr. Trump would not be meeting with state leaders on Tuesday at the White House. On Tuesday, he canceled a planned trip to Alabama, the site of one of the worst-hit areas. Other presidential decisions planned for Wednesday and Thursday include ordering federal agencies to be fully operational for days as they work to help customers and state officials rebuild from the damage caused by Harvey. FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and local departments of transportation will provide assistance during the storm, Mr. Trump said in a statement. As recovery efforts continue, he said he expected to issue an executive order."

858,"Fears Rise for World Leaders as Officials Test Positive for Virus Swine Flu Vaccine Officials in the United States and Asia are testing a swine flu vaccine that could be approved in the next week or so, raising the risk for another big outbreak. The World Health Organization warned that the death toll from swine flu was expected to rise to 275. The health agency said that the vaccine, called H1N1 but not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, was effective enough to protect against the virus but that it was not yet ready to be handed to medical patients. ""If confirmed, this is a very serious situation,"" said Dr. Margaret Chan, who heads the agency. She said that the vaccine must be used only ""for the purposes of preventing the spread of pandemic flu, and for the protection of health-care personnel and care providers."" The vaccine, known as an orphan vaccine, has been developed by GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi, in cooperation with the Harvard School of Public Health and the National Institutes of Health. The vaccine is made by Merck KGaA. The companies are trying to build the vaccine into a commercially available drug, a process that would require regulatory approval. Only four doses of the vaccine have been available, and most of the patients have not responded to treatment. In the United States, the virus has infected at least 215 people, killing 561, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But some of the recent deaths were related to swine flu, because of complications with the vaccine. Dr. Diane C. Curtis, an infection specialist at the F.D.A., said that the vaccine was still a crucial tool in fighting the outbreak. She said that the vaccine could be given to ""some very sick people"" and that it should not be taken as a substitute for other vaccines. Earlier this month she said that she expected to approve orphan vaccine after testing it on more than a million people. The vaccine works by preventing the virus from multiplying in the body, and it does not affect the immune system. Until recently, the virus had been considered ""almost nonexistent"" in the United States, Dr. Curtis said. But in the last week, many of the deaths related to the swine flu virus have been linked to other diseases. Dr. Curtis said the vaccine would help protect the public from those diseases."
859,"Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths How many people died of a deadly virus? According to a new analysis compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most common causes occurred in people who had not been vaccinated. While vaccination rates are high across the country, the recent rise in reported cases was not overwhelming; the CDC believes that the infection may be getting worse. The number of cases in the U.S. has more than halved over the years. The CDC estimates that 8,800 Americans died of the virus in 2015, but that's not all bad news. The number of people who died of the virus is still rising. According to the most recent CDC data, there were 26,730 cases of the virus in 2015, a 63 percent increase over the previous year. That's a nearly 20 percent increase over the previous year. However, the report notes that many patients are still unvaccinated. And while that number is still relatively high, it's not necessarily the worst-case scenario. ""The CDC is concerned that the new number is an increase from the previous number,"" the report reads. The agency is especially concerned that more patients may have gotten the infection while receiving the vaccine. The percentage of deaths that occurred over the past year is also still about the same as it was in 2015, however, the agency notes that while the reported deaths may be low, they are still ""higher than the threshold that would pose a risk to the general public."" Even when the CDC does get some good news on the outbreak, it's not clear what the full extent of the outbreak will be. There is also no estimate yet for how many people have died, but the CDC is planning to release a report on the outbreak later this summer. The virus is one of those conditions that will be studied in January as well. However, that report could be helpful to public health officials who are still trying understand the virus. ""It's going to take some time for us to understand to what extent this outbreak has affected the population,"" Dr. John Byers, head of the CDC's Division of Immunization Practices, said at a briefing about the outbreak on Tuesday. If there's a significant increase in the number of cases, then it's going to be a challenge to see whether it is any more widespread. Dr. Byers noted that the situation is ""dire"" and will require further attention."
860,"Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths Each year, health officials and public health officials around the world report rising cases of the Aedes aegypti mosquito. There have been 152 reported cases globally, but the vast majority of the cases are linked to people traveling where Zika infections are being diagnosed. One example was in an 18-year-old girl infected with the Zika virus in Miami, Florida. She died. Aedes mosquitoes are found all over North America, but cases of Zika have been seen in many countries, including the United States. The last known case was in Brazil in 2015, which resulted in the death of a 5-year-old girl. The virus can spread through sex to people who contract it from blood transfusions or sharing needles. In the latest outbreak, the virus was detected in a 23-year-old woman who was tested positive for Zika. The virus can cause severe birth defects in newborns. But the virus can also spread through blood transfusions or sharing needles from one person to the next, and the CDC advises pregnant women and their partners to use insect repellent. The virus was detected in a 24-year-old woman who contracted Zika while traveling to South America. She was hospitalized. The virus has killed about 450 people in 37 countries since it was first identified in Uganda in 1947. The virus has been detected in more than 200 countries, including Colombia, Ecuador, Haiti and Venezuela. The World Health Organization said Tuesday that the number of cases of Zika in Venezuela has increased by more than 100 percent. The country has reported more than 400 Zika infections. The virus has also been linked to liver cancer. The virus can cause serious birth defects in newborns and other health problems. It carries the brain's immune system and can cause swelling and blindness in newborn children. The virus can also cause Guillain-Barre syndrome, a disorder that can lead to paralysis in the brain. Other health issues related to the virus include kidney stones, high blood pressure and severe muscle pain. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are found all over North America, but cases of Zika infection have been seen in many countries, including Brazil, Colombia, and Costa Rica. Deaths from the virus can amount to thousands of lives."
861,"Coronavirus in N.Y.C.: Pressure to Close School System, Nationâ <unk> <unk> s Largest, Leads to Evacuation Officials say a New York City elementary school is on lockdown and parents trying to get their children home due to an outbreak of the coronavirus, which is suspected of sickening 150 children in eight schools in the city's New York City neighborhood. Parents were locked away when they entered the building at First Ave Elementary in Queens about 9: 30 a.m. Monday, according to the New York Police Department. The school was later evacuated and no one was taken to the hospital. The school is in the Bronx. The New York City Health Department said Monday morning that none of the students would be ""seriously ill."" The school closed early Monday due to the situation. Coronavirus is a respiratory disease found in a swarm of viruses, including the common cold, dengue fever, West Nile fever and SARS. ""I can't believe I had to stay in school,"" resident David Sadik told ABC News. I had to get out of the school. I just can't believe something like this could happen on my doorstep. The city Health Department also released a statement saying it was urging public health officials to move schools into precautionary lockdown until they can find the source of the virus. No other schools were evacuated, as required by law. Officials said the school building was secured during the lockdown. The children were being sent to school as precaution, authorities said. The school was able to reopen after the closure. As of Monday afternoon, however, officials said it was ""unlikely"" that all the affected children would be able to return to class. ""It's not clear when the school will reopen,"" said Mary Ann Azzopardi, a spokeswoman for New York City Health and Hospitals. Officials said they did not have a way to determine if the affected students had contracted the virus while in school. The school does not open to the public until May.

862,"Travel and the Coronavirus: Answers to Your Top Questions Q I'm a retired British Airways pilot living in Florida and have been fighting this coronavirus since last September. I've been in touch with my wife, who has been sick and has spent time in the hospital. As a result of the virus, she has been on an internal flight to Australia to undergo a CT scan. So I am going to travel there and treat all the family. How do I know if my symptoms are really the flu? A It's not a viral infection, but a cold or flu, or other serious illness that may be affecting your health. The virus can spread very easily from person to person and is not airborne. The best way to protect yourself is to practise good hygiene and wear insect repellent. The virus can cause fever, chills, and rash, but if it is spreading your immune system, you may also need to get the flu shot. If you are sick or have any other medical conditions, contact your doctor. It's not the flu itself - in fact, it's the virus that can cause it. There are many ways to protect yourself against coronavirus, including staying at home and limiting contact with others. The best prevention is to wash your hands and hygiene products that have been used for years. And if you have a cold or flu, wear protective clothing such as long sleeves, gloves and repellent. If you have a respiratory infection, the infection can get worse and even kill you. When you recover, the virus has got worse. People with serious or life-threatening illness should not be isolated and should stay at home for 14 to 24 hours after symptoms begin. Most people recover within three days, but if you develop a severe illness, please see your doctor. Some people with serious or life-threatening illness may need to be isolated for a couple of days if they have flu-like symptoms. The best thing to do is to stay away from high-risk areas like hospitals and hotels, as this is a very serious virus and people can become infected by it. A vaccine for the disease can be bought by visiting the NHS website here. Exercise or eat a healthy diet is also good for you. If you have a cold or flu, get yourself checked out by your GP. After being quarantined for long periods, people can be free of the virus for up to three weeks"
863,"How to Clean Your Phone to Help Protect Against Coronavirus While you're on vacation, you may be feeling sick, and it can cause stomach pain, fever, and other illnesses. Many people tend to get sick when there's something unpleasant about the virus. To protect yourself, experts recommend cleaning your phone with a disposable wipe and cleaning the screen with a soap and water. It's okay to use the same wipes and cleaners around your face every day, but cleaning a phone or a computer often causes your body to reset itself. When wiping your electronics with clear oils, consider using a tablespoon of water with hot water to wash your hands more. ""If you're scrubbing your phone and you have a hard surface to clean, you might have a bacteria or a fungus in your nose that can cause a potentially dangerous infection,"" said Dr. Steven Milanesi, director of the Prevention of Infections at the University of Pennsylvania, in a statement. It's important for people to be aware of the risks and to stay alert and to follow recommended precautions. Using antibacterial wipes and antibiotics can protect against infections more easily - but if you're carrying sensitive items such as medication or medication, experts advise calling your doctor if you're at risk for the infection. Check the phone / computer settings to make sure it's clean. Keep the phone wipes and the computer to a minimum. The best thing to do when handling sensitive objects is to disinfect it with soap and water for at least 30 seconds. Your doctor should also advise you to take the computer with you if you want to protect yourself. A common cause of a severe infection is inflammation of the throat. You'll get rid of the virus by using antibiotics and by washing your hands frequently. Finally, experts have also recommended cleaning your hands with warm water and soap. If you're sick, shower and apply a towel to your rectum. It helps to prevent the virus spreading to the cell, and prevent the spread to tissues and organs. Check with your doctor or health care provider if your infection is causing you any pain or discomfort. Copyright © 2018 HealthDay. All rights reserved. All rights reserved.

864,"Amid Coronavirus Anxiety, Should I Stop Making 401 (k) Contributions? While the number of workers who have had some form of health care payment canceled for the recent national flu outbreak stands at 10.3 million, the number of public hospitals that have been unable to reopen has surpassed the number who cannot reopen. The numbers are significant, as last week's Supreme Court decision striking down the federal government's mandate that health plans cover mandatory vaccinations was a significant victory for public-sector unions. The decision resulted in the cancellation of approximately one-third of the nation's public hospitals, but the number of health-care employees who had money from their employer's 401 (k) program has surpassed that number. Employers with more than 500 employees have had their 401 (k) plans canceled at the moment, although many may have already been notified. And those who have no plans, such as workers who were on the verge of a layoff, may not be able to withdraw their money or withdraw it entirely, leaving workers with no way to use their 401 (k) money, as they have not been able to before. To stop the cancellations, employers must notify workers of their plans for cancellation and, if needed, have them pay their workers through their own payroll deduction. Employers may also be able to cancel payroll deductions they believe are out of their control if the employee dies, but they may have to include them in the plan. If the employee dies, the employer could have the deduction suspended. The act, known as rule 154A, allows the employer to pay the employee's living expenses for up to 48 hours after expenses are paid - based on how much the worker has saved and what the worker has paid for the past 12 months. To be sure, the act does not prohibit employees from withdrawing money from 401 (k) plans if they are unable to make the decision to cancel their plans. However, employers with more than 250 workers have had their 401 (k) plans canceled at the moment, although some may have already been notified. Many employers would certainly welcome such a measure, given that it will limit the number of people losing money at a time when their paychecks are still low. The federal government should be using this as a chance to offer the benefit of the doubt to its employers, and to taxpayers."
865,"Stocking Your Pantry, the Smart Way to Save on Thanksgiving You're probably already craving turkey and pumpkin pie, and you might want to grab a few bags of other vegetables to get to a great store for when the turkey reaches its full energy. But if you're a truck driver, there's no better time to get the Thanksgiving turkey and pumpkin pie ready so you can pack them in your pantry and save on everything you have coming in for the holiday. At the end of the day, if you're looking to save hundreds of dollars on your pantry, that's a good way to save more than $100. Walmart and Amazon are selling a variety of Thanksgiving foods, including a variety of pumpkin pie recipes, stuffing and pumpkin pie recipe sections. Whole Foods is offering a variety of pumpkin pie recipes, including pumpkin pie recipes with orange beans and pumpkin pie recipes with pumpkin pie. It's actually only $3 to $4 cheaper to get your pantry pantry food than it is to give it to the neighbor. For $6, you can get a pack of pumpkin pie for $1.50, or a box of pumpkin pie for $2. If you prefer to go to Whole Foods specifically, you'll get a box of pumpkin pie for $5, or a box of pumpkin pie for $1.50. On top of that, you'll also get a few delicious pumpkin pies.

That way, you'll have enough food to fill up for the rest of the week. It's also good to know that most people will start saving for the holidays when they're out of luck, but the extra money can help you be prepared. A large glass of wine will make a big difference in your saving. Turmeric is a common antioxidant that helps lower blood sugar levels and will help you feel fuller for longer. It's also a great source of vitamin C, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases."
866,"Learning to Live With the Coronavirus Q If I have a serious infection, I have a very easy way to get rid of the virus. I don't want to get a nasty shock. I have to avoid all sorts of contact with people if you do. People have reported that they've come down with the virus - so I'm trying to avoid all forms of contact. Is there an effective vaccine? A In the cold and flu season, the cold and flu virus is usually spread among people who are injecting drugs, or who have been in close contact with infected patients. But some people will have a severe flu-like illness - like a cold - and often suffer a long-term illness. The best way to avoid getting sick is to get vaccinated. In this instance, the first two doses are given as soon as possible. If you're in the immediate vicinity of a cold or flu outbreak, you will need to be vaccinated immediately. As you can see, it's safe to do so. There is some evidence that the virus can survive in the airways for a few weeks or months or even weeks. However, people can recover between three and six days without having to be treated. While the best advice for individuals is to be vaccinated, it is important to be aware of the signs of infection. People can get the virus by inhaling, coughing, sneezing or touching contaminated objects, such as surfaces. People know they are infected by a virus and should get medical attention immediately if someone they are in contact with or if they show any symptoms such as fever, chills, cough or runny nose. People can catch the virus if they have sex with someone they love or are sharing a bed with for the duration of the visit. If you have any questions, you should call the doctor's office or the CDC's free hotline, 1-800-CDC-HHS-1. Tips for preventing the spread of influenza from person to person: Use hand sanitizer when handling, and wash your hands or face. Use hand sanitizer inside your home and when handling surfaces. Take extra precautions like using your hands when handling soft objects such as objects, cups and dishes. If you have a cold or flu, wear masks. Check your CDC-approved stool for signs of disease. If it's unusual, see your physician or local hospital if you have any questions"

But the health authority handling the emergency in Mexico says that only a few hundred people will need to see a doctor for a week to see an effect of the illness. So while the virus has been mostly confined to people in Mexico, health authorities are warning that it may spread to other regions of the globe. The World Health Organization said the virus is spreading at a rate of more than 2,000 cases per week, and that more than 10,000 people have died.

Medical experts say that many people who are infected do not get sick and don't need to see a doctor to be sure. See Photos of Doctors' Readiness to Seek Care. So, if you are infected in Mexico or the United States, you might need to get your flu shot if you want to stay in contact with others. To make the point, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that people who are pregnant should delay getting shots. The agency also recommends that anyone who hasn't been vaccinated against the virus to get a flu shot. That's because it can be a serious infection, resulting in severe complications like pneumonia and kidney damage. What to Know If you get the flu, you need to get vaccinated.

Credit Al Bello for The New York Times A study of the outbreak of the Zika virus in New York, England, found that patients who have been exposed to a person with the virus in New York were 11 times more likely to die than patients who have not been exposed to the disease in the United States. a finding that could lead to a potential epidemic epidemic in the United States. The finding was made by John Katulis, one of the authors of an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association detailing the cases in New York. In all, at least 10 people have been infected with the virus in New York since the beginning of the year, at least four of them infected by sharing needles. Most of the cases became public last week, when the health department released a report documenting the cases. Since then, the rate of cases has been steadily rising. The data were published on Thursday in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. In a statement, Dr. Stephen Ross, the journal's editor and a specialist in infectious diseases, said he was ""profoundly disturbed"" by the study, which was ""further confirmation of the need for better coordination between the federal and state health departments, across the nation, and the public."" The study noted that the risk of a transmission from mosquitoes to humans is greatly reduced by a vaccine. ""In addition, Zika can be successfully treated with a vaccine that contains a live virus,"" the study said. While experts have been frustrated by the lack of data about the Zika virus in New York, Dr. Katulis said he was optimistic. ""You can imagine this is a problem for a lot of people,"" he said. But it's still a big problem. New York City's Health Department continues to monitor the situation, said Dr. Robert N. Ferrante, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Rochester Medical Center and the study's lead author. ""We're doing a lot of work now on this,"" he said. But we have many promising things in the pipeline. Dr. Ross said the study was a reminder that the virus was still emerging, even as countries sought to prevent it from spreading."

The show is to be staged on Nov. 10, at 7 p.m. and 7 p.m.; it will be directed by the actor Stephen Sondheim. It is scheduled to open on Nov. 1 at the Public Theater. The new show marks the first time that Mr. Sondheim has had such a prominent role in a Broadway production in the last decade. His last Broadway show, ""Into the Woods,"" was last seen in 2004 and ran for six months. It was also the final performance before the theater closed on Sept. 10 to prepare for a reopening. The show is to be directed by Mr. Sondheim's long-term associate, Sam Gold, who is also the director of the Sondheim musical ""Company."" The play is about a man who has a nervous breakdown after a night of drinking.

His first Broadway show, ""The Big Lebowski,"" opened in 1983. He later returned for ""Company"" to star as the president, and in 1991 he played the president in ""Company,"" which won the Tony for best musical revival. The last Broadway production by Mr. Sondheim, which was in 2009, was ""The Little Mermaid,"" which reached acclaim in 1998. It was directed by Mr. Gold; the show ran for three months. Mr. Sondheim and Mr. Sondheim have not spoken in years about the possibility of a Broadway show, but in February, when the Public announced ""A Little Night Music"" to open in London in March of that year, Mr. Sondheim wrote on Twitter, ""Well, I'm happy to know that a show is in the works."" Mr. Gold responded to Mr. Sondheim's Twitter message: ""I look forward to watching this play."" The Broadway production of ""A Little Night Music"" will be the first to be performed by a well-known performer at the Public Theater since its last staging in 1997."

Credit Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times Re ""The Women Who Defied Boko Haram, and Survived 50 Years of Violence"" (news article, May 11): When you speak to survivors of Boko Haram, many of them are women. As I saw the horrific videos that these girls had to watch on TV, I thought, ""This is not something that I am going to be able to see again."" What matters is that when you speak to survivors, they are all here to tell stories. Suzanne Omirin is director of the Center for the Study of Women and Girls, New York University. She is also the author of ""Don't Fear"": How Women Can Fight Boko Haram. See more about her. In 1998, she founded the Violence Against Women Initiative, which has made a significant difference in preventing and combating violence against women. The three-part series, ""The Women Who Defied Boko Haram: A Tale of Women's Endurance and Fighting for Rights,"" will be broadcast on National Public Radio and on the Web this fall. The series will share the stories of women who are now survivors of the violence that is going on in Nigeria, and will also take readers on a tour of Chibok, which is one of Nigeria's most devastated communities. And at the heart of this work is a commitment to end violence towards women and girls, regardless of gender or culture. Women will be welcome to come and report on the issues they face. It is clear that many of the reports and events, and those of survivors, are being driven by a culture of fear and intimidation. As we prepare to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the kidnapping of Chibok schoolgirls, we should not forget how the Nigerian government - along with many other countries, many of which have tried to build coalitions - has failed to protect and empower survivors of violence. We hope that this series of stories will go a long way in reducing the number of women and girls who have been affected by these abuses. Twelve years after the Chibok girls were taken, they are still in danger. The writer is a former diplomat and a distinguished fellow at the Center for the Study of Women and Girls"
878,"The Weekly | Meet the Woman Who Outsmarted Boko Haram An American journalist in Nigeria has caught a glimpse of a woman who has been indicted in a federal court in Washington for her role in the kidnapping of nearly 200 schoolgirls. Elizabeth Palmer, a New York Times reporter who is based in Kano, Nigeria, documented the case of Abubakar Shekau earlier this year, in an article titled ""The Woman Who Outsmarted Boko Haram."" She describes the woman as a ""very charismatic young woman who speaks with a very specific, feminine style."" Her story has been widely shared on social media, and Palmer tells ABC News that she has received hundreds of messages of support. ""I've received a lot of messages of support and thank-you,"" Palmer said. Palmer's article appeared in a piece published in March on the Nigerian site Abdulahi. The Nigerian military has been accused of abducting the schoolgirls, at the end of April. Their release has become a global appeal, but the girls ""captors remain unknown and their whereabouts are unknown."" It's a horrible tragedy, ""Palmer told ABC News. We've been in touch with the girls"" families, our embassy. We're still trying to process what happened and we'll continue to do that. ""What Abubakar Shekau did was horrific,"" Palmer continued. It's important to note that he is not a member of Boko Haram. He is part of Boko Haram's leadership. Palmer said she had spoken to Shekau a number of times since the abduction, but that she had not heard from him since the first photos of his body were released earlier this month. Palmer said that she is particularly concerned about her health, and has been monitoring her husband's condition. ""I am extremely concerned about my husband,"" Palmer said. On Sunday, she told ABC News that she is getting updates from her children. ""They have told me that they're happy and healthy and that it would be great if they could get some time with their father,"" she said. ""I have concerns and worries that my husband's health is deteriorating,"" she said. I'm also concerned that my husband's health is also deteriorating.

879,"Opinion | How to Fix the Coronavirus Testing Mess in 7 Days Opinion: Why the CDC is Fighting an HIV Epidemic CDC reports an HIV outbreak that's been identified for the first time and reaching epidemic proportions. ""This may be the most perplexing scientific report of all time,"" said the CDC director on science. The problem, he added, is that ""the epidemic will likely return, and the real goal is to prevent transmission of many more cases."" The study was published in the September / October print edition of the journal Science. The CDC continues to recommend that people avoid close contact with any patients who seem to be infected with HIV. The most important step for anyone with the virus is to get tested, or get treatment, says the CDC. In the meantime, the CDC recommends that everyone who is at risk of contracting HIV get tested. If a person develops a fever and needs to see a health care provider, it is recommended to see a doctor. It is also recommended to stay home from work - and if the person is in a high-risk group, they should call their doctor immediately to see if they are infected. For those who have had their own fever, the CDC advises taking precautions: wash hands regularly and frequent a bathroom with soap and water, and use hand sanitizer that contains alcohol and fluids (although the CDC did not recommend that people use hand sanitizer). Dr. Margaret Chan, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, told reporters that over the years she has seen significant increases in the incidence of HIV in her country and around the world. ""This is a very serious infectious disease,"" said Chan, adding that nearly 70% of people who contract HIV are still infected in their late 40s or early 50s. She added that the CDC has been studying for years how to stop the spread of HIV in the US. The outbreak has so far had no significant effects on people living in the US, but is proving to be a major challenge. ""This is something that will take a very long time to resolve,"" said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has said that it will invest $100 million to increase the number of people testing for HIV, which is currently around 6,000 people per month."
880,"Opinion | How to Fix the Coronavirus Testing Mess in 7 Days How to Fix the Coronavirus Testing to Fix the Coronavirus Testing It takes about 48 hours to catch the virus, and the vast majority of patients recover within a week. A person who has the virus may have an incurable skin disorder called rosacea. ""You have one to two weeks with the virus, but people usually have a very mild one to two weeks of the virus,"" said Dr. Frank Schadt, a clinical professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at New York University. Send a flyer or a letter to a doctor and ask if they can do a test for it. If you do get it, you can get it antibiotics. You can control its symptoms by taking antihistamines and other medications. If this happens, it can be treated with a course of antibiotics, which are not always effective. It is important to wear gloves and mask when handling germs. Avoid contact with people who have the virus and do not know they have been infected. ""Don't touch people,"" Dr. Schadt said. You will start to spread the virus. If you suspect someone has been infected while in the hospital, you should call the hospital to make sure it is clear. If you suspect you have been infected while in the hospital, call that emergency room. Avoid touching people who have been sick. If you have had contact with an infected person, wash your hands and use bug spray, with a hand-held fan. Avoid touching or kissing people who have been infected. If someone has an infected joint, they should use a small amount of sanitizer with them. If you are infected, don't use a hand sanitizer with you. You're putting someone's life in jeopardy, ""said Dr. Schadt. The CDC continues to advise against travel to affected areas and to talk to your doctor if you have any questions. Parents should also be aware that the virus can be spread by direct contact with an infected person, including sharing utensils, soap and water. Avoid sharing pet dander, cutlery or other household items. If you're having medical problems, you should call the emergency room at any time."" People should be aware of the possibility of catching the virus, ""Schadt said."
881,"With Coronavirus, It's Time to Declare a National Emergency - The New York Times I was struck by this story last week about the decision by the United States Department of Agriculture to ban the use of chicken by poultry farms in the national salmonella outbreak. Many people are saying the decision is a political move - they are just trying to prevent an outbreak of salmonella, an outbreaks of food-borne illnesses that are caused by campylobacter, an organism that can be found in cooked chicken, eggs and raw meat. It's time to declare a national emergency, and it's worth noting that there have been no reported cases in the United States linked to chicken raised in the chicken. Indeed, the C.D.C. has said that the decision was not linked to salmonella. The problem, however, is that there appear to be large numbers of chicken farms with no oversight, and because the outbreak only affects chicken raised in salmonella-free chickens, it is not clear who is to blame. The decision to ban the use of chicken by poultry farms is not a decision that is made lightly, but it amounts to a political move by the government to prevent an outbreak of salmonella. The C.D.C. states that it is ""not currently aware of any reports of instances of salmonella from salmonella in chicken raised in chicken coops"" and that ""the cause of salmonella might be the inability to obtain chicken from chicken raised outside of the chicken coop."" That's not all. While the public doesn't usually get sick from salmonella, it can also become severely sickened from the bacteria, which can cause diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain. It's important for people to be aware of the risk of salmonella. An estimated one in every 200 people who get sick from salmonella will die. If you're sick with salmonella, get the salmonella test done - you'll find lots of foods that are especially harmful to your health. The E.P.A. says chicken raised in the chicken coop should be destroyed; the agency only recommends that chicken be thrown away. And chicken farms will never be certified as unsafe. But the E.P.A. says that if chicken is allowed in the chicken coop, it should be kept out of the hands of children."
882,"With Coronavirus, It's Time to Declare a National Emergency - The New York Times I've been traveling and have been sick, and now I know a good thing: it is time to declare a national emergency. And it doesn't have to be a big deal. The virus, called coronaviruses, has spread from people who got infected through contact with blood. But there is no vaccine, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people who have been hospitalized for fever, aches or other health problems get treated with antibiotics, which are most likely to reduce symptoms. Some states have declared emergencies, but, usually, the government does not declare a national emergency. Most states also have laws that require insurance companies to cover all medical costs related to being exposed to the virus. It is not just about being reinfected. People are also being encouraged to be cautious when coughing or sneezing, and to take antiviral medication. On Sunday, the C.D.C. declared the disease an international emergency, and in the past, health departments have not taken any action to declare a national emergency, partly because of the cost and availability of antiviral drugs. But the C.D.C. says that it is taking the steps necessary to ""ensure that we manage this severe health emergency effectively and effectively."" It is important to note that the C.D.C. says that it does not have time to declare a national emergency. It will work with state governments to address the situation. Some states may be able to implement contingency plans and plan for recovery, like setting up additional emergency teams or other services. But it is important to note that it is not just about being reinfected. The disease spreads by bodily fluids. It is a very contagious disease, with many people who come in contact with infected patients and who develop a fever called gastroenteritis. The virus can spread by coughing or sneezing, or sneezing, or sneezing, or both. It can also turn into pneumonia. It is also a vaccine-preventable disease. To protect yourself against it, it is essential to know the symptoms of the infection, especially early in the infection. If you are already sick, it is imperative that you seek medical attention right away. For more information about measles, please see the C.D.C. ""s Web site."

And though the World Health Organization currently recommends that all U.S. child vaccinations be voluntary, health departments across the country, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are still reviewing new information on the virus, especially the possibility that it might be spreading from the Philippines.

With as many as 199 countries reporting cases of the deadly virus in recent years, the situation in the Middle East is becoming increasingly urgent. According to the report, the number of cases in the region has increased by 38 percent since 2010. The World Health Organization estimates that about 50 percent of those infected die within the next 12 months. The report of the study from Dr. Susan Locke, a clinical adviser to the World Health Organization, and the University of Michigan, showed that just one in five donor countries has given to the coronavirus cooperative. ""The World Health Organization has done a good job of raising awareness, but the problem is the real number of cases,"" said Dr. David Heymann, a co-author of the report and chief of the Department of Infectious Disease at the University of Michigan. There are still many people around the world who need a hand as we continue to fight this epidemic. The report, which was written by Lisa A. Davira, a professor of CDC's Division of Immunology, said that the number of people with severe coronavirus like the one that killed 141 people in Indonesia has fallen from more than 50 million to less than 25 million. ""If we continue with this epidemic and continue with the slow recovery of the number of cases, we will see an increase in cases that can be stopped,"" Dr. Heymann said. Coronavirus has not been eradicated, but there are still hundreds of millions of lives at risk of losing a loved one to the disease. In recent years, the disease has evolved into a more virulent strain, which can be spread through the air and through contaminated water. The World Health Organization says it has taken on additional duties to fight the disease, including introducing the ""hand washing"" campaign that has been successfully used in a number of countries. The agency has also begun testing for the virus. ""The World Health Organization continues to work to halt the spread of the infection and is dedicated to continuing to help countries and communities as they address the needs of patients,"" the report said.

Obama has won nine of his first 10 presidential debates. The two candidates will square off in the first presidential debate, on Oct. 19 in Omaha, Neb., the first time any of the candidates will meet face-to-face since the Iowa caucuses in February. The first debate, in Ames, Iowa, was dominated by criticism of the Obama administration's handling of the economy. The debate was widely seen as a referendum on Obama's economic record. Obama and Romney will have a chance to revisit the debate later this year. Obama clinched the nomination with more than 270 electoral votes. If Romney does not win the nomination in November, he will be leaving office at the end of the year. Obama, who is not running for re-election, has vowed to not return to public life until his party takes control of the Senate and House of Representatives. Romney, whose campaign has been hampered by negative attacks from both sides of the aisle, has vowed to win the presidency. His campaign has begun a voter registration drive across the country to raise money for his re-election bid, with polls showing the race tight. More from ProPublica: Obama, Romney Rival Push for Election Results Obama and Romney have run in similar numbers since June 2012, when Romney won the Iowa caucuses and beat Obama in the New Hampshire primary, according to exit polls. Romney wins the Iowa caucuses in a landslide, his campaign says, with nearly 70 percent of precincts reporting. In a victory speech in Omaha, Romney will urge both sides to be more engaged in the general election."" We are going to win this election because our country is stronger and stronger and we're going to make it easier for you to get a job, ""he will say, according to excerpts provided to ABC News."

But a new study suggests it could really help you to rev up your diet. The research, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, looked at a group of people who were shown images of junk food each week and were given either daily or weekly snacks. In one of six groups, the researchers were shown slices of cake and cheese snacks. The group that received the snacks ate more than three times the amount of unhealthy food when shown the photos of the food. The researchers, led by Dr. John Gardner at the University of Arizona, found that those who ate more junk food were more likely to be obese, have higher levels of diabetes and a lower body mass index. Their body mass index was also higher, and their BMI was higher. The researchers found that those who ate more junk food had more insulin than those who eat less junk food. The researchers are hoping to develop similar studies based on the same group of participants in the future to see if the same effect could apply to people who eat less junk food. ""Obesity is a new, widespread and often preventable public health problem,"" said Dr. Gardner in a press release. Since childhood, this issue has been associated with increased healthcare costs, and it's important to understand this association. The researchers believe that the findings would be applicable to other populations. This article originally appeared on Health.com.

897,"Fears Rise for World Leaders as Officials Test Positive for Virus Leaders worried about the spread of a new virus have rushed to test the virus in the United States. The World Health Organization said Tuesday that it was ""aware of an epidemic"" of the highly contagious virus in the United States. The agency said it was working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and federal health officials on a response to the crisis. The virus causes vomiting, diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain. ""It is a very serious disease,"" the WHO said in a statement. It has the potential to be transmitted through contact with surfaces containing eyes, sweat or urine. The agency said it had traced the virus to a hospital in Pennsylvania. The agency said it was coordinating with the World Health Organization and the State Department to ""combat the spread of this virus."" ""Access to the affected areas is extremely limited and we are not able to provide an exact number of the people affected and have not been able to reach them,"" the agency said. Earlier this year, the World Health Organization reported a new strain of the virus that caused severe illness in Africa, and two new cases of a similar infection in Asia. The virus has swept through parts of Asia and has sickened more than 200 people. In a separate case, more than 600 people have been infected in China. Health officials say they are now trying to contain the virus. Health officials have said that if a person becomes infected in China, they should contact their doctor to screen them for the virus. The World Health Organization said it was working with the United States for a response to the crisis. ""We strongly encourage people worldwide to take precautions to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to others,"" the organization said. We have taken measures to ensure that the possibility for transmission of the virus is minimized. The virus is not contagious but can be transmitted through close contact with a person who is infected. It can be treated with antibiotics, but it is typically difficult to know for sure that the infected person will try to pass on the disease, officials said. But as the virus spreads, there are signs that it is becoming more common in the United States. The number of cases of meningococcal disease, caused by swine flu, has risen to 12."
898,"Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths The deadly virus has killed more than 100 people in more than a dozen countries in the past 12 days. And before you fall off your couch, you should take a few precautions. For the first time in human history, the virus has made headlines in multiple countries. According to researchers at WHO, the worst-case estimate for the number of deaths from the virus is more than 100. WHO's Global Virus Task Force reports that more than 7,000 people have been infected. Health officials have said they are not yet prepared to declare an end to the virus. The current death toll from the virus is believed to be in the hundreds. So what can you do to minimize your risk? Most people with the virus will choose not to drink or take medications, and vaccination is essential for preventing transmission. It's also important to wash your hands frequently and avoid touching or kissing patients. And remember, the virus is not airborne. You can catch the virus through contact with an infected person. When you're sick, your body secretes antibodies that can stop the virus from replicating. These antibodies are then used to treat the virus. The best way to prevent the virus from crossing the barrier is to get vaccinated: If you've been vaccinated, don't share your personal information with your loved ones. However, if you know someone who has been vaccinated, it might be best for you to go ahead and get the shot. The virus can survive on surfaces and can be infectious for months if you come into contact with someone who has been infected. The virus can also survive on surfaces or people. If you have contact with someone who may have been exposed, wash your hands, avoid touching and kiss -- they can spread the virus. Use condoms and avoid sharing personal information with others. Prevent sharing unprotected sex and injecting drugs. You need to avoid sharing intimate photos with someone who has been infected. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention In an effort to counter the virus, officials are urging Americans to wash their hands, wear long sleeves and avoid close contact with people who may be infected. According to the CDC, the majority of cases of severe respiratory disease are caused by the flu. Although the virus is highly contagious, it can occasionally cause a serious illness, like pneumonia."
899,"Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths in 2014 Health officials say the most devastating risk to U.S. health from the worst-case outbreak of the deadly strain of the coronavirus has been recorded in 2014. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that the disease occurred in 43 states in 2014 and killed at least 2,684. The last time the U.S. had a case of a new coronavirus was in July 2014. CDC officials cited a jump in the number of cases in recent months. The virus, which has caused more than 600 deaths, is considered the most virulent coronavirus ever. It spreads when infected person-to-person contact between people exhibits a severe, but unrelated, illness. Coronaviruses are mainly harmless, giving the body a mild illness. But a vaccine that protects against the disease could cause most people to take their aches and pains to a greater degree. The CDC counted 214 cases of severe coronavirus in 2014. No deaths have been reported. The agency says the virus remains rare in the U.S., although there are cases in Puerto Rico and Texas. The CDC also said on Friday that the latest update on the most recent case, an 18-month-old child from Arkansas, had died. The agency also released the latest update on a 20-year-old boy from Florida who had a rare form of the disease and died in July. The new numbers are based on the most recent update of the federal measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The agency said the most recent update means the outbreak has been halted in 24 states. The agency says the new data did not include the U.S., Puerto Rico and some of the other three states that reported cases. The CDC says about 1,200 people in 46 states have been infected by the virus, and it has not confirmed any cases in Ohio and Pennsylvania. In addition to the deaths, a federal report said that last year there were at least seven people hospitalized with the virus. Since 2003, the virus has been largely eradicated in the U.S., though cases of chronic respiratory illnesses continue. CDC: http: / / www.cdc.gov / h1n1flu Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.

City Councilwoman Tammy Wong, who is a member of the health committee, said that although there is no shutdown at Coronado's school, the school's community is being taken hostage.

901,"Learning to Live With the Coronavirus A new study finds that nearly 90% of adults and 4% of children have had a coronavirus infection. The virus is spread by inhaling infected semen. A new study shows that almost 90% of adults and 4% of children in the United States have had a coronavirus infection since 1999. The findings were released on Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study was conducted by researchers from the CDC and CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. They tested people who had never been vaccinated. Twenty-two percent of children were also vaccinated, and the remainder had not. The CDC estimates that about half of people who have been diagnosed with influenza in the past two years have been infected with influenza with the coronavirus. Nearly 30 percent of those who were vaccinated had passed the virus on despite the current CDC recommendation. By contrast, only about 1 in 9 people who were vaccinated had passed on the virus. The researchers are continuing to examine whether the virus can be transmitted from person to person and how it is spread. The study is published online in the December issue of the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Researchers said they hope their results will prompt more public health officials to look into whether to vaccinate children. ""The research... tells us that the only people who should be screened are those who have had the disease and those who have not,"" said Dr. Jennifer Beckles, first author of the study and director of the CDC's Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

Symptoms of meningitis include fever, chills, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting and drowsiness, according to the WHO. The illness, which can be deadly for young children, can spread to the brain, spine and other organs. Symptoms can start as a red-purple rash that appears as a spotty bump on the nose, followed by a burning or itchy rash, which can be severe. The symptoms can last for up to three days and include vomiting and diarrhoea, and the rash can spread up the brain, spine or spinal cord.

As part of a drive-through clinic at New Braunfels State Hospital, where around 60 percent of all cases of swine flu are reported, a team of vaccines is working on creating a new formulation of the swine flu vaccine. The new vaccine, which is administered by a team of a few researchers, works by attacking a virus in the body - the virus itself - like a virus. The new vaccine can restrain the virus's ability to spread, Dr. Jim Riley and Dr. Thomas Frieden of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told CBS Dallas. It's already proven to be safe. It's also very good at preventing swine flu, says Dr. John Anderson, director of CDC's Division of Vaccine. ""This is a big step forward and we want to do more,"" said Frieden. The new Ebola vaccine was developed by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, a professor of medicine at University of Colorado School of Medicine. Wakefield's team is working on the new vaccine to be used when needed for emergency preparedness, and it plans to start shipping it to WHO in the fall. Swine flu is spreading quickly in much of the world, and it's only a matter of time until it spreads outside the Americas. That's why the World Health Organization is pushing for more labs to get vaccinated. The WHO is planning to send a flu vaccine to countries with high levels of vaccination. In the U.S., where the outbreak is most severe, the CDC has been swamping its facilities with a huge backlog of vaccine. Even more so in Britain, where the outbreak is the most severe and has so far infected more than 4,000 people and killed 685. The CDC has also been working with others to get enough vaccine shot out of the country. To get the swine flu vaccine, the CDC is working on a new vaccine. But it's a little bit early to know for sure. This is an epidemic but it's an epidemic. We're working with the private sector to get a vaccine, ""said Frieden."
905,"Efforts to Control Coronavirus in the U.S. Could Get Even More Extreme, CDC Says -- WASHINGTON, Feb. 15, 2014 / PRNewswire-USNewswire / -- In an effort to fight the spread of a highly contagious coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today issued the following statement, following the conclusion of its investigation: We found that the number of cases of the new coronavirus in Mexico has increased significantly since May 15, 2014. This has resulted in a significant increase in the reported number of confirmed cases of the virus in the United States. A total of 121 confirmed cases have been reported in the United States and Canada. Cases of the new coronavirus have increased by 40 percent in the past week alone. The virus continues to spread in the country, where it's still spreading. H1N1 has spread to more countries, including at the southern tip of Mexico. An estimated 120,000 people have become infected with the virus in Mexico, with more than 8,000 of them having died. The recent spike in cases is a result of a surge in the number of cases of a highly contagious virus that causes severe and sometimes fatal respiratory illnesses. The average age of the infected person is 37 and it is important to recognize that the illness has not spread to the general population. Although it is not infectious, it can lead to a wide range of symptoms including fever, muscle pain, and sometimes pneumonia. ""The increase in the number of cases of the new coronavirus in Mexico has been attributed to increased transmission of the virus to hospitalized patients and to the increased availability of medicine,"" the CDC said. The CDC continues to monitor the movement of the new coronavirus and is working with the World Health Organization to develop a vaccine. The CDC encourages the public to maintain a healthy lifestyle, have a healthy body weight, and to maintain a healthy weight.

906,"The President as Bystander: Trump Struggles to Unify a Nation on Edge of Crisis, but there's a Remark on the Case It was a great evening, and I should say, the country applauded Trump for his measured approach during his State of the Union address and for his own words, which were not afraid to be blunt. As I wrote earlier this summer, the fact that Trump had failed to address the issue of gun violence in his first address without breaking his word in this forum was striking. This is a country where gun violence is a thing of the past. In the past, President Bill Clinton, for example, avoided speaking about gun issues in the immediate aftermath of the Columbine shootings. In the aftermath of the Sandy Hook High School massacre in 2012, President George W. Bush opposed more gun control. He believed he could change this country, but there was no commitment from him on gun control. This makes the reality that mass shootings happen all the more disturbing. Trump made his point on his first night in the Oval Office - ""If you see this place, and the whole country at that moment - you know they're not going to be able to get through this, to get through this,"" he said in his opening remarks. And I don't want to go any further. I want to go forward, and I will. The President has yet to detail precisely what he will do to prevent a repeat of the Las Vegas shooting, but it is clear that Trump has made his position clear: He wants to make changes, and believes that the Second Amendment will protect Americans. He wants to enact a ban on assault weapons, but he wants to keep the Second Amendment. On foreign policy, he already has a record that is not exactly palatable. He can't be president that way, so he has to try to unite a divided country. But he is not likely to do that. He has already taken a beating from the Republican establishment. He is unpopular with his own party. His first priority is a strong, but unpopular, Congress that has failed to contain the president's worst impulses. Donald Trump has yet to demonstrate that he can unify a nation. He might be able to do so, but his success could be a long way off. His opponents may be starting to lose their minds. He is a big figure, but he is no longer the Trump of the moment."
907,"The President as Bystander: Trump Struggles to Unify a Nation on Edge of Ignorance The White House has been shaken by President Trump's behavior in the aftermath of the Charlottesville riots, but the chaos was still evident in Capitol Hill. President Trump turned his body on a woman who had been protesting white supremacy and racism. His comments about the undocumented and the ""son of a bitch"" were at odds with his campaign promise to ""drain the swamp."" As many of his aides struggled with the fallout, the President remained silent. The fragility of the President's stance about the Charlottesville protests was made clear in his first televised remarks on the crisis. In the immediate aftermath of the clashes, Mr. Trump appeared to blame ""both sides"" for the violence. During the first year of his administration, Mr. Trump repeatedly praised the law enforcement response to the violence, which included the use of heavy-arm tactics. He also defended Secretary of State Rex Tillerson after the attack, calling him a ""good man,"" and said the country had ""a great future"" if he allowed more civil rights and equality. In the wake of the Charlottesville violence, Mr. Trump repeatedly took to Twitter to blame ""both sides"" for the violence. In a late-night phone call with the Russian foreign minister, he was asked about reports that Mr. Trump had called Vladimir Putin ""a thug"" and suggested - only to then later clarify that he had not made the comment. After the outcry, the President sought to calm tensions. ""We're all fine in the aftermath of this great moment in the history of our nation,"" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday night. We are all together, all Americans going to be okay. We're all very proud of the fact that we have been able to get along. We're all going to be able to focus on the things that matter to each other and the country. He added: ""I think it's going to be a great day for America and for the world, and I think it's going to be a great day for our country."" Mr. Trump also addressed the fallout from the attack, and said the situation was ""a real blessing"" for his country, but the president did not take questions from reporters. His national security adviser, John Bolton, was also in attendance but had no comment, according to the White House pool report."
908,"Afraid of Coronavirus? That Might Say Something About Your Politics March 20, 2011, 11: 47 am Should voters be worried about the worst of the outbreak of the Aedes aegypti mosquito? As of Thursday, the outbreak was continuing, with at least two deaths. As of Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in a 48-hour period on Tuesday and Wednesday, the epidemic has killed one person in Florida, as well as at least nine in California, including four in the Bay Area. Those figures may suggest that voters may have not learned the lessons of the recent outbreak. The Aedes aegypti mosquito has been known to carry the virus that causes the Zika virus. But experts believe that the virus can bite through the skin and cause blindness. So there's a lot at stake here. As we have reported before, the Aedes aegypti virus has caused a relatively mild flu season in the United States, but it is not the only Aedes aegypti virus circulating in the United States that has been shown to cause severe illness. In general, the virus can cause serious illness and death in humans, but this particular virus has caused significant damage to the eye and resulting internal bleeding. So we have to assume that if people notice signs of infection, such as fever, rashes, headache, sore throat, and muscle aches, they will look for more information. The danger is if the symptoms are mild and people suspect they have been infected, they should seek medical attention immediately. But the experts say they have not yet determined when the virus will emerge and how far it will spread. So the danger is that people will be more likely to ignore it, or they will think that doing so will help protect themselves. It will also help fuel popular anger over government inaction and the absence of basic information about the virus. Michael R. Gordon, a professor of biological and evolutionary anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin and the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, will discuss the implications of the Aedes aegypti virus in an opinion column in this week's issue of the journal Pediatrics. The article, ""How to Be Prepared for an Aedes aegypti Disease,"" first appeared in the magazine in April."
909,"From Rocky Season to No Season, Inside the N.B.A.â <unk> <unk> s Decision to Freeze the Players Photo A player reacts during the first quarter of the N.B.AÂ ""s national championship game between the Colts and the Houston Texans on Jan. Credit Michael Bostwick / Getty Images The N.B.A."" s decision to suspend the players indefinitely on Thursday is designed to bring the league's dysfunctional, often violent, labor relations to a head. The suspensions will be imposed for the entire 2011-12 season, beginning with the preseason. Teams that will not appeal will be allowed to sign free agents, which are usually a prerequisite for a player's return. Forfeiting the rights to negotiate for a free agent, however, means that N.B.A. teams will have to pay, just to keep their star players intact. Teams can still negotiate for a deal before the season is over, but players must approve waivers and be able to sign before the league opens. Players will not be able to speak with reporters. The N.B.A. is likely to rework its rules to address the issue. A collective bargaining agreement between the players and the owners will need to be reached before any players can be cut. But the suspension of the players could be a win for the pro sports leagues, which have faced considerable economic pain from the N.B.A. lockout. After several years of a labor dispute, the N.B.A. and players have made some progress. The league is expected to forge a new deal with the players by the end of March, and Commissioner David Stern and the league's chief executive, Adam Silver, have said they hope to have a new agreement by the end of June. The players ""union is set to begin a national campaign to keep the N.B.A. in the country and is set to spend tens of millions of dollars on television advertisements to promote the sport. The union is also stepping up its campaign to urge other professional sports leagues to make their own deals. The N.B.A. and its owners want to see the league reconsider the lockout and have already agreed to work together in developing a deal, including the prospect of a long-term deal. The financial losses the league incurred last season and its subsequent decline have been compounded in recent years by the cancellation of several games, most of which lost money. The league will be able to withstand the loss, but it will likely have"
910,"Stephen Sondheim, the Man Who Felt Too Much for the Pets The musical adaptation of Mr. Sondheim's 2006 book ""Broadway Baby"" is being billed as a show about the ups and downs of a family that combines the comedic elements of Broadway's hits. The musical, which had its premiere in August, is being directed by Daniel Sullivan; he will direct, and the production is to begin previews on Oct. 15 and open on Oct. The book chronicles the ups and downs of four children, led by the musical's three-time Tony Award-nominated star, Sarah Jessica Parker, who played the role of Dorothy. Mr. Sondheim wrote the book himself, in part, while at the New York Theatre Workshop. ""It's not a biography, it's a retelling,"" Mr. Sullivan said at a recent opening night for the show. ""Everybody hates Broadway and the musical,"" he said, ""but in"" Broadway Baby, ""it's about someone who's very much in their own world."" The musical, with songs by the Broadway composers Ted Meyers and Arthur Laurents, was written by Mr. Meyers and his wife, Elaine Mason; the production also included songs by Mr. Laurents, and choreography by Mr. Meyers and his wife, Dana Brunetti. With a book by Ms. Brunetti and lyrics by Mr. Sondheim, it features lyrics by Mr. Meyers and a book by his wife, a former producer of ""Wicked"" and ""Jersey Boys,"" who died last year. The show will have its debut on Broadway in the fall of 2014. ""Broadway Baby"" opens officially at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, on the Upper West Side, on Wednesday, with an opening night on Oct. 23, and ""Jersey Boys"" on Dec. 1, with the New York premiere on Oct. Mr. Sullivan said the new show would have an audience of about 1,100 for opening night and ""between 1,000 and 1,500 for the entire run."" A spokeswoman for the New York Theater Workshop declined to comment. Mr. Sullivan's new musical is being directed by David Ives, who won a Tony for the original Broadway production of ""Follies"" and is currently in production of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" on Broadway.

911,"Stephen Sondheim, the Man Who Felt Too Much, Dies at 89 Stephen Sondheim, the composer and lyricist who made such songs as ""Sweeney Todd"" and ""West Side Story"" and who came to be known for his playful songs, died on Oct. 13 at his home in Southern California, his family said. His death was confirmed by his longtime publicist, Christine Madden-Gail. Mr. Sondheim, who was born James Gandolfini, was nominated for an Academy Award for his score for ""The Big Lebowski,"" but didn't win. He was inducted into the Sondheim-Gandolfini Rock Hall of Fame in 2008. In a 2010 interview, Mr. Sondheim said that the ""Big Lebowski"" film was a ""perfect"" way of introducing new songs to his audience. The film starred Idris Elba, who had previously played the title character. He is played by Johnny Depp, who has also had success in the role. Mr. Sondheim, who performed with the ""West Side Story"" ensemble at the Hollywood Bowl, wrote and directed ""Sweeney Todd"" and ""West Side Story,"" which won the Best Original Song Oscar in 2002. In an interview in 2001, he said he could not remember the musical scores he wrote for other musicals. The Broadway musical ""The Book of Mormon,"" based on the book by the children's author, won two Tony awards in 2006 - best musical revival, and best lighting design. Mr. Sondheim wrote the lyrics for the ""West Side Story"" show for many years, before becoming a writer and director. He is survived by his wife, Jane. Stephen Sondheim, born February 8, 1928, died April 25, 2013 in California, of ""complications of pneumonia,"" his family said. He was 48. His marriage to the actress Mary Steenburgen ended in divorce. He is also survived by his son, Aaron, and three grandchildren. Stephen Sondheim was born on Oct. 7, 1926, in West Hollywood, Calif. He attended UCLA and the University of South Carolina in 1988 and graduated from Harvard in 1966. He was a member of the South Side Boys of the Chicago Orchestra from 1967 to 1969. He was also a member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and a dancer at the Sundance Film Festival."

But as Ms. Streisand said in an interview with The Times, ""we've been listening to the work for years, even decades since a play opened."" ""Funny Girl"", which is co-directed by Ben Brantley and stars the Tony Award-winning actor David Hyde Pierce, follows the comedy in which two women, played by Eva Longoria and Emma Stone, are asked to sing ""I Dreamed a Dream"" by Jerry Herman. Ms. Streisand said that she first heard the concept for the show while she was on a flight to New York with her daughter, Esmerelda, 12, from her visit to the Broadway show about a young boy who dreams of becoming a singer. ""It was just a very special song that it was,"" she said. I had never heard it, but I was already in the mood.

When it first appeared, it had a big impact on public health in the United States. And while it's still spreading, it has been reduced. The virus used to cause the common cold will be gone in days. And when it's gone, it's gone in a pretty quick and clean way. But how do you fix it? Take a look at how you can help. A doctor will look at a virus and determine if it's viable. If you have a patient who is sick, it may be the best option at the time to get the patient to a hospital. Here are some recommendations for how to make sure the virus stays out of your system. Do not go to the doctor. If you are sick, do not come in. If you are sick, get the flu shot. Do not get a flu shot. If you are sick, say at all. If you are sick and have flu-like symptoms, go to the doctor. If you have it, get the shot. This will take about two weeks. If you are sick, you should get the shot. If you are sick, get the shot. If you are sick, get the shot. If you are sick, get the shot. If you are sick, get the shot. If you are sick, get the shot. It's important to get the shot.

921,"Opinion | The Government Has Failed on Coronavirus, but There Is Still Time to Hold The United States has been suffering with the acute respiratory syndrome, or C-diff, since 2003. The disease, which primarily affects children ages 4 to 18, kills about 200,000 people each year. The World Health Organization, which has been keeping up the fight against the disease, has reported that more than 3,500 cases of the disease were reported in 2015, compared with about 2,500 cases in the previous five years. Health officials now say that the virus may be evolving but that they are not ready to declare it a pandemic. And they are looking for ways to control it without putting the public at risk. For instance, it's considering trying to limit the number of infections that can be detected in patients by asking patients to self-report antibiotics and treating patients for symptoms that they haven't been exposed to. It's a common practice in countries like the United States that have been on high alert because of cases of C-diff. In addition, health workers in the United States have been reluctant to take on the new challenge by reporting infections to their colleagues. In a study published in the journal Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, researchers noted that in the United States alone, 244 cases were reported in 2015, compared with 172 cases in the previous five years. That's too many cases for the C.D.C. to handle. The cost of preventing C-diff should be minimal. It is important to note that the CDC is not recommending that doctors should report C-diff cases to their patients. Indeed, it has recommended that doctors, including doctors, should share the information with their patients, not just their own. As the virus has spread, so too has the number of patients infected. While it is difficult to bring the epidemic under control, the public would do well to remember that the virus can attack the heart and brain, and that it can also spread to the rest of the body. And, if it does, the CDC is likely to need to act in the years to come. Dr. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger was the captain of the plane that crashed in the Hudson River in January 2009.

A federal panel will decide how to fix the problem. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2010 cuts corporate taxes to 28% from 35%. The top tax rate is 35%, while the lowest is 30.5%. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has declared that the President's tax plan will lead to 160,000 to 245,000 job losses. ""Taxes cannot be higher -- they must be cut,"" said the chamber's chief economist, Thomas Donohue. This is not the time to increase the minimum wage or raise taxes on businesses. We need policies that generate more revenue. This is a moment for the Republicans to prove they are not just a bunch of tax-and-spend cons. This is the time to make it a reality for the American people. The group wants Congress to pass the Senate plan by the end of November. The House tax bill, which also would raise the top rate from 35% to 39.6%, is part of the larger GOP tax plan. Republicans in Congress are committed to tax reform. But we need to pass a bill that can pass both chambers, ""said House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich. Other notable GOP tax cuts this year include an overhaul of the standard deduction, the alternative minimum tax, which is due to expire at the end of this year and a repeal of the estate tax -- the big difference between the two tax plans. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that more than $1 trillion in tax cuts would be passed in the tax overhaul -- including $1.3 trillion in repeal of the estate tax. We are on track to cut the deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next decade. That is the biggest deficit on record this year,"" said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad, D-N.D. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the deficit would be $930 million in the coming fiscal year. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2010 would eliminate the estate tax and replace it with a property tax. The House version includes no changes to the alternative minimum tax."

In recent years, the Court has made it clear that it has the power to ban strikes that cause economic hardship, in part because the courts are unwilling to compromise if they think strike action is the only way to stop a company that is unfair, or at least to stop the company from going broke. Now that it has changed course, the Court has upheld the strike policy and declared that it is not against the law of the land to strike -- but that it is not against the law of the land to strike. In short, the court has recognized that striking workers are employees of the company, and reaffirmed its previous orders. The strike has been an important step for the company. In the past, it has been successful in getting the courts to limit strikes. Today, the court has upheld strikes against the company in a number of other cases. The court issued a ruling that upheld strikes in two separate cases, as well as a decision the company had just struck against one of its employees. The strikes are not uncommon in labor negotiations, and the case should be on the record to demonstrate that striking employees are workers. The Court's previous rulings have been upheld by both the United States Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court, and the Court's order is in line with the Supreme Court's order. In May 2011 the Court rejected strikes by striking workers, but the court has not yet reinstated strike threats except for a five-day trial. This case has clearly illustrated the extraordinary importance of holding corporations to the highest standards of corporate responsibility. This case is not about striking workers. The Court has not only concluded that strikes are against the law of the land, but has also issued a clarification on how unions are protected from strike actions. These decisions are a major victory for employers and workers who feel they can make their members and their company members"

Now that I have left the New York Theater Workshop, I am working on a play by Robert Langer. It's called ""The Last Merrill."" It's about a composer who is living by the rules and trying to translate what he learned and what he wants to write into something that works. I think the material hasn't been seen in New York, so it was a bit of a cliché to say that, this time, I'm going to make a play. I think it will be a play of sorts. I don't know if anybody else will make it. The best you can hope for is that you can write and be the first one to do it. But I think it will be a couple of months before there are any dramatists who can write it. Do you have any other theories about the writing that I think have been developed? I've got some real ideas on it, but I don't know what they're. If you want to write an opera, you have to write an opera. If you don't, there's nothing. But I'm not trying to be an opera-writer. If one of the options is to write an opera, then I will do that. And if one of the options is to write an opera, as I write, then maybe we can have an opera. When I write, I want to finish the show. But I can't do the writing without the writer. What else would you tell people? I believe in writing well, and that's a philosophy I have. I want people to feel that a good opera is a good opera. I also think it's important that the audience knows where the story ends. I'm an opera fan, so I can't help but think of myself as a novelist. I don't know who else will do it. There are a lot of writers who write about the same thing. I don't know if that's something that I can do. But if I can do it, I can write about anything. And I mean, I can write about that. I don't want to be famous because I don't want to be famous for it. If you write, you write. How can I do that? I can do that, or I can do that."

926,"Opinion | A Story From Inside the Coronavirusâ <unk> <unk> Early Whirlwinds of the Global Warming Pathogenicâ <unk> <unk> This year, the world has witnessed the world's warmest ever summer on record and the summer is expected to be even hotter. The weather pattern is changing, but the severity of it is still unknown. So what are the lessons we can learn? Do people need to take precautions? Here are some answers. First, we can take a position on the global warming scare, not just because we hear it every day, but because the truth is that it is happening every part of the world. We call it the climate impact scare. This is a term that is used by climate scientists, often referred to as ""global warming syndrome."" Many scientists and policymakers will admit that the global warming scare has been overstated. But the warnings are being given every day and they are just the first of many. Climate change scare is real. But the more scientists think about it, the less likely they are to make a change. Our best approach is to take steps to reduce our emissions and to make our houses more energy-efficient. We can also take steps to reduce our dependence on oil, to curtail greenhouse gas emissions, to make the world safer using less fossil fuels and to make our planet more resilient to future climate change. To improve our own physical and mental health, we will need to be more aware of our climate. Research shows that we have a lot to learn about what creates a longer-lived climate. As a simple question, don't worry about it. When you're facing these kinds of uncertainty, the best way to deal with it is to take action. We want to make sure you are aware of it and that you are prepared to take action. First, we have to figure out where we are going to get our energy from. We need to create new generation sources of energy, like wind power. We have to find ways to use renewables in our homes, and we have to use the sun's power in our homes. If we have to use solar power, we have to start using solar energy. We do need to work out how to use energy more efficiently, and we have to develop more renewables. We have to come up with more efficient models of energy use, and we have to put more people on the grid."

However, the preventive issue with this outbreak stemmed from our fact that our patients were not tested for [HIV or hepatitis C] before they got vaccinated. I am a practicing paediatrician who is also involved in prevention of HIV. I do not know of any cases in which the infection has been associated with birth control pills or other medications. I have not seen any of the patients or their families receiving these medications at this time. I have no reason to believe that HIV or hepatitis C had any connection to the pills and supplements. I have seen no evidence of HIV infection in my patients, and I have not seen any signs of other infections. In addition to the question of why the outbreak occurred, the CDC has also concluded that ""all of the patients who were infected have been contacted by healthcare providers to get vaccine treatment,"" and that this ""may have been due to the fact that the patients were not tested before they were vaccinated, or in this case for vaccines."" I am not aware of any other cases in which the infection has been associated with vaccines, nor has any of the patients received any vaccines. This virus will continue to circulate in the community for the next several days for several weeks. On the other hand, we still have a majority of the infected individuals who get vaccinated. This virus will circulate in a small number of families for some time. We are very wary about it because it is so much more rife than previously thought.

928,"Opinion | We Need to Flatten the Curve. Trump and Fox Are Behind It. President Trump has moved back to the days when news organizations wanted to report from Washington on his presidency. And all that has changed. Amid this realignment, journalists can now focus on reporting from the White House. Trump's tweets about the news media tend to be much more direct than he has been. The only way Trump can be seen working this way is at a time when he is being attacked for his refusal to condemn the far right's violent xenophobia -- or, as he put it, ""not being taken seriously anymore."" He was often criticized for that. He was criticized for not being tough enough when it came to condemning illegal immigration and for not acting decisively enough against ISIS on the campaign trail. That in turn led Trump's critics to question his commitment to upholding the Constitution. On Monday, he said that ""it is not the job of our government to protect people from evil."" We need a president who cares about ordinary Americans, not a president who cares about the media, not a president who cares about the people he accuses of being corrupt. How do you get someone who cares about ordinary Americans, not a president who cares about the media, not a president who cares about the people who are hurting from illegal immigration and the people who are hurting from Obamacare and the health care law? Trump has said. The last time he was so explicit was in an interview with CNN. Trump's aides have always believed that they have a strong position in the press. They have a powerful opinion on the ""fake news"" media, and even Trump's own tweets can have an influence. They have a chance to put their own spin on the president, and to do so in the press. These are important steps to demonstrate to the American people that the Trump administration will be tougher on them when it comes to covering the news. It is imperative that we protect the reporters who report on us every day; those who give us the most important stories, and those who risk our independence. That is why we want a president who is going to uphold the Constitution: not always winning, but always winning. We have a president who will not shy away from controversy, and he will always fight to protect these journalists. That is why we need to stay focused on Trump."

As the mother returned, the child fired multiple shots, killing him, sheriff's Lt. Eric Barnes told The Times. His mother was sitting in the front passenger seat of the car, Barnes said. The bullet entered through the car window and exited through the back door, killing the boy, he said. The mother was struck in the left leg and the son was shot in the chest, the sheriff's department said. His mother, who was not identified, was hit in the face and the body was recovered from the parking lot. The boy's father, whose identity was not released, turned in his gun, and deputies found the father in the foyer of the mobile home park where the shooting occurred, Barnes said. The boy was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The boy's parents were not home at the time and the sheriff's department was investigating whether they had any connection with the shooting, Barnes said. No indication has been given as to why the father killed the family and deputies are looking into whether the father could have been angry at his sons. Barnes said the father, who has not been identified, was a ""very disciplined person."" He added that the case was being handled by the county's homicide bureau. He said the boy and his mother had been in the family for about two years. The boy's mother, who was not identified, was in her home when the shooting occurred, the sheriff's department said. ""It's a really sad situation,"" said Sheriff Steve Poughan. I think it's been a pattern of violence. It's devastating for the family. I don't want to speculate on what motivated the father to assault his family or in fact a terrible incident.

936,"US politics is becoming more ""conservative"" than ever, says Trump Donald Trump has attacked the media as a ""total and total disgrace."" Picture: AP Photo / Evan Vucci FIGHTER Donald Trump has hit back at journalists and the ""fake news"" media as he declared he wants a ""media that's more conservative"" than ever before. The Republican presidential hopeful said news organisations were so in debt to their readers that they were ""out of control."" Mr Trump, who takes the lead in the polls, said the media had no right to tell him what he thought of the media and was ""just doing so."" ""If you look at the media, they're not going to give you the truth, they're just going to tell you what they think,"" he said in a Fox interview, which aired on the Fox network. I think, actually, the media's been out of control for a long time. I think they have been in a very, very, very bad place. There has been so much fake news, this has been a lot. Mr Trump also said that he was worried about the potential use of the courts to enforce his executive order - which he has said is needed to protect Americans ""privacy. He said that if he wins the White House, then it would be"" a very big step for many years. ""He said he expected the courts to"" take action ""against the order."" You know, you have a bunch of judges that decided, ""Well, I'm going to uphold the order."" They said that was the right thing to do. I didn't get a majority, ""he said. I'm trying to win - I'm not going to get a majority. But I'm trying to win this thing, and I'm trying to get this done. Mr Trump said the American people had a right to hear the"" truth ""of his policies."" The American people are saying, ""Listen, Mr Trump, your policies are good, but they're not working."" They have a right - they've got a right - to know what's good for them. Look, they're doing very well. But we've got a lot of problems. They're spending a lot of money. We're a lot of problems. We're a lot of problems. We're running up against a lot of problems, and we're going to get a lot of problems. The White House declined to comment."
937,"Explainers may be charged over claims of rivet incident in South Africa, says NFU The NFU is to investigate claims that an alleged rivet incident led to the death of former South Africa scrummager Bryan Habana. Habana, 37, died during a scuffle with South Africa's national team in Cape Town on 27 July. NFU chief executive Jurie Roux said: ""The NFU will conduct an internal investigation including a physical examination and its own internal disciplinary procedures. For the sake of our members and fans, we are making no comment. South Africa's players and coaches have also been told they must remain"" as normal ""following Habana's death."" Our thoughts are with Bryan's family at this very difficult time, ""said the NFU. Habana was a lovable character who used to play for the Springboks and was described by the South African Rugby Union as"" a gifted player. ""He was the leading scrummager in the NWRA's World Cup squad and also played for the Bulls and Sharks. Habana was one of 10 South African players to see a doctor in London for a suspected shoulder injury. The former scrum-half's family have been told he will have an operation on Monday to remove loose cartilage."" We are taking the matter very seriously, ""said NFU chief executive Jurie Roux. This will be a very sad day for Bryan and his family and we are not prepared to comment any further on this. South Africa's government has agreed to send medical experts to South Africa to examine the injury. The National Health Service said it will not make any further comment until the investigation is completed. Habana travelled to London on the day of the incident, but left to meet the Springboks management and doctors. South Africa's All Blacks fly-half Beauden Barrett said there had been"" a bit of banter about it ""and there had been"" unsolicited and unprovoked ""abuse. Former Springboks prop Jean de Villiers described Habana as a"" nice guy ""who was always"" a good guy. ""We're not sure what happened, but there was a fight in the toilet. We brought a towel to hand, but there was blood everywhere. There was a lot of blood,"" he said. He was on his own. Very brave. I think he is a good guy."
938,"Inside Wuhan: Watching my wife get coronavirus They had been advised to stay in bed for four days, but I was told to go to hospital for an X-ray. I got it in the morning, but since then I have been coming back from the hospital, and I am being treated with anti-viral drugs. My wife took it and has also been put on medication by a doctor, but she has been recovering properly since. The first thing doctors do is follow standard infection control advice. My wife says she feels fine now, and that the whole thing has been very amicable. As a junior, I would not have taken it as a bit of a prank. I knew I wouldn't get it back, and now I feel fine too. The last thing you want to do is to do anything that will scare you. You want to keep your sanity, and you don't want to inadvertently put yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time. You just have to be prepared for what you are going to get if you get it. I am not sure that I would have gone back to work in a nursing home, so I would have been in a better position to work in a nursing home. But being a nurse in central China is such a different job. I am in the process of doing my own assessment and doing the best I can. I am doing my maximum to try to prevent anyone getting infected. The last symptoms of the contagious coronavirus are fever, sore throat and aches and pains. Anyone can get coronavirus, but most people are not in a very good state to get it. People who get coronavirus from eating pork or duck should stay away from pigs and chickens. Health workers who have a close contact with animals should wash their hands thoroughly before handling them and, if necessary, follow the advice no longer to cook pork but to cook pork. To reduce the risk of spreading the disease, people should also avoid eating pork in schools. The symptoms of the disease usually appear around the time of eating so people should follow the advice to ensure that they are not showing any symptoms. The average age for catching coronavirus is 40, so if you are on your way to the dentist or an emergency room, you may find yourself wearing gloves or bandages, and it may be a precautionary measure."

Mr Trudeau said he was ""considering"" a free trade agreement with the US, while also stressing the importance of Canada's infrastructure investment plan. Meanwhile, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in Washington that he was ready to offer Canada a better deal. ""Canada does have a large trade surplus and we have a big program with the United States,"" he told the BBC. The US has also complained about the pact's unilateral tariffs. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has met US President Donald Trump. The two leaders are due to speak later to reporters. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it was ""unacceptable"" for any country to be taken advantage of by other nations. ""We are ready to consider a free trade agreement with the United States,"" he said in a statement to reporters on Monday. Mr Trudeau said he hoped the two governments could begin the process of discussing a new bilateral deal in the coming weeks after Mr Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr Trudeau thanked Mr Trump for his commitment to the ""reset"" of relations between the two countries, and said both sides had made ""significant progress"" on issues such as trade, arms control and human rights. Canada's government had earlier warned of a tariff war among Asian countries if Mr Trump's proposals to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium came into force. Mr Trump is expected to announce the plans in coming weeks. Mr Trudeau, whose agenda includes Canada's planned exit from the North American Free Trade Agreement, earlier met with the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.

941,"BBC News - Plane crashes in New York A small plane has crashed in Manhattan, killing all four people on board. The twin-engine plane went down in a residential neighbourhood near Madison Square Garden at about 2230 (1330 GMT), according to the New York Police Department. The plane was part of the Red Cross's Aircraft Services team. The injured are reported to be members of the Red Cross. Witnesses reported seeing ""black smoke"" coming from the plane, Fire Department spokesman Paul Browne said. Debris from what witnesses described as a plane crashed into a building on Madison Avenue. Police said it was not yet clear what caused the plane to crash. The crash site is a few hundred feet (meters) from the World Trade Center site where two hijacked airliners crashed on September 11, 2001, killing more than 3,000 people. © Copyright Press Association Ltd 2008, All Rights Reserved. http: / / www.reuters.com / fulllegal.asp? id = 2 & d = 42055 & id = 506042 This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. © Copyright Press Association Ltd 2008, All Rights Reserved.

942,"Business costs, especially in banking, and jobs based on Britain's easy access to the EU are also in question. The Prime Minister, Parliament - and, in the end, all of us - must consider very carefully how we approach these talks and how high a price we are prepared to pay. The decision has been taken. Many voted to leave in the knowledge that Brexit would have costs. But talking about these things in theory is one thing. Experiencing them in practice is another. This country has never put dogma above practicality. It should not do so now. Putin away the cider! So Russians are savouring the unique bouquet of English cider in St Petersburg and Moscow, while vodka-drinking is in decline. Vodka is an aggressive drink - rocket-fuel for the mind - while cider has a slower, more soporific nature, so this may be good for international relations. Next, we might introduce them to cricket. If verses are not top of the agenda, they would be stopped drinking in hotel bars. Maybe then it will be time to send them crates of beer. Crazy! What's the best beer to celebrate? I think we can all be expected to stop drinking jugs of beer to remember the past? Originally, Margaret Thatcher's Baroness Thatcher said that, by spending time on the red benches and seating outside, she'd help British politics. She isn't an idle woman. She's a historian and knows nothing about wine. But these days, she knows something about these two vital qualities. As for the future, we need to see less of the obsessive patriotism of what we used to call the British state. Most of us were proud to be British. At least until recently. This may be a time when we're asking the Royal Family for a glimpse of Meghan Markle. If it is her, we want to see a more bold and daring figure than the Duchess of Cambridge. She is also smart and has a tremendous sense of style - just like Kate Middleton. Alas, it is all new to her. Huge task, but one that should not be beyond her. Unlike many of her generation, who have followed the steady, determined rise of her hue-headed grandma, Meghan has had to show she can act. If she takes the reigns, she'll have done so in a manner that is neither fussy nor rebellious."
943,"Technology may have helped solve the UK's internet problem In April, David Cameron warned that the internet was about to take the ""ultimate"" step back, with a new generation of internet-connected machines expected to drive a huge rejuvenation of Britain. The Prime Minister said the internet was a ""brilliant thing."" But concerns have grown over the quality of the internet speeds available in a country where the UK has one of the lowest internet speeds in the world. In June, a damning Ofcom assessment of broadband speeds in the country by the regulator found that only 32 per cent of homes, between 0.9 and 5.4 megabits per second, were able to access the internet on their desktops. The Government announced a £50 million investment in broadband between 2010 and 2017. While many providers are keen to add fibre networks to improve their networks, Mr Cameron has been fighting for the roll-out to reach everyone. Last month, two of Britain's leading broadband providers, TalkTalk and BT, announced that they were launching an initiative to boost download speeds. Mr Cameron said that the Government had made tough decisions to deliver superfast broadband, including the introduction of 4G broadband and the creation of a ""Competitive Edge,"" a new industry-based broadband infrastructure plan. But he added that there was still a ""long way to go"" and it was important to give consumers a better deal. He is also leading calls for the UK to remain part of the Common Fibre project agreed by the European Commission, the National Audit Office and the CBI. But Mr Cameron said that British consumers were ""absolutely"" behind the internet-connected houses in the land today. Competition between the UK and France, Germany and Austria has been fierce, with nearly two-thirds of all homes in the country able to access the internet at less than two megabits per second. But Mr Cameron has hit back at allegations that Britain's broadband is lagging behind the rest of the world. In a speech last week, he said that broadband was ""not fixed"" and called for a national roll-out of super-fast broadband to combat rising bills. But the Prime Minister also said that the Government was working with Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, to bring broadband into the country. While the Government admits to ""profound"" problems with the internet, Mr Cameron said BT was now working on ""fibre-optic broadband opportunities in the UK."""
944,"Science & Environment - The New York Times Q. I have a new rodent recently. A. Is there a problem? A. Rodents are carriers, not creatures. They move around by themselves because they are startled by their surroundings - they are unable to find them in a wide open space and their droppings are not as sharp as they once were. Because of the new adaptive evolution, the rodent's behaviour is affected by external objects. Rodents are also dependent on the environment in which they live. Usually, the animals will feed on plants, insects, fungi and insects and live in a particular social group. But when a rodent tries to scale a building, it will jump down and run into the ground. If it is not able to find a new rodent, it will start to run away. If it is hungry, it will climb up its gracefully-built tunnel. If it is not hungry they will attempt to climb on to the roof of the building. They will attempt to scale it, but it will fall. Eventually the rodent will run away. Is there a safety net? A. Rodents can live in densely populated areas with few resources if they are not willing to flee and can eat anything, including fruit or vegetables. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that there are between 400 and 1,000 rodents in each city in the United States. More than half of them are rodents. The rodents that live in densely populated areas have evolved to tolerate a wide range of environments, including the most visible ones, like the New York City subway system, the subway system and the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. In cities like Los Angeles, the rodents have moved into more suburban areas, and most of these places have become more densely populated since humans arrived. The rodents, in fact, are adaptive to conditions in which they live. They have been known to hunt in packs and attack people, and they are more likely to hunt for people. Rodents, while not a common sight in urban areas, can catch people unawares by acting as a deterrent to them. They can also move through the open spaces of buildings, and can jump over fences and trees to gain access to people. The rodent is known as a ""rodent soldier"" because of its ability to jump high."

946,"Entertainment & Arts - Arts - New York Times Well, maybe the most interesting thing about ""The Wonder Years"" is that it was first written by the same person who was behind ""The Simpsons."" ""The Wonder Years"" is a new series for Fox, which is producing it along with Fox Searchlight Pictures, which is producing the show and Fox TV Studios. If you can't wait for the next episode, to be shown in around an hour, you may be surprised by the series ""title:"" The Wonder Years. ""It's a little like"" The Simpsons ""- a series built around a family of characters that gets more and more complicated, but keeps evolving into something new. Now, what's the title for"" The Wonder Years? ""? Sure, it's a name that's a little like the"" Simpsons ""title, but it's not a way to describe the new show."" The Wonder Years, ""produced by the same company that makes"" 30 Rock, """" does not say anything about any of the characters in the series, but it does include one, a young girl, played by Nicole Beharie. That girl was referred to as Yun (also known as ""The Simpsons"") by her father, played by Zach Gilford, in the novel. Now the show is producing and executive-producing the series. The title is often the title of the show. There's no real mention of Yun in the book, but it's a very personal title that goes back to the first book. That's one of the reasons ""The Wonder Years"" went on to become a classic television show, one that was also just as big as the other big-screen shows: ""The Simpsons"" and ""The Twilight Zone."" The show is getting a lot more of that weight than ""Arrested Development"" or ""Homeland."" The idea is that if there is something new or interesting to watch in this latest Fox series, it's already created. Fox has said that the upcoming ""Simpsons"" episodes will revolve around a family of characters, but it won't be ""The Wonder Years."" The show is still in development. Would you like to see it, or do you want to see it on television? What do you think about the series' title? What role should ""The Wonder Years"" play?

949,"Reality Check verdict on EU citizens in the UK Image copyright AFP Image caption The decision is widely expected to affect European expats living in the UK Expatriates from the European Union may face deportation or be banned from entering the UK from countries that have no guarantee of residency rights. The Home Office said a decision was about how many EU citizens were covered by existing EU regulations. The government is expected to announce on Tuesday it will not extend the right to free movement of people from the European Union. The government said it was delivering a ""fair and reasonable"" immigration system. The UK's exit from the EU means the rights of EU nationals living in the UK are protected, but not guaranteed. The move is widely expected to affect foreign expats living in the UK - such as Britons born in the UK but living in countries that do not have similar arrangements. In particular, those who have lived in Europe for a long time will be affected if they are unable to prove they first came to the UK for a definite period of time. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the government would seek to make the right arrangements for EU citizens to stay in the UK before the end of the year, but only if the deal can be reached with the European Commission. ""It is important that EU nationals who have lived here for a long time are able to spend time with family and friends, enjoy and plan their lives ahead,"" she said. But what makes it so important is the ability to spend Christmas helping us celebrate our country's long-term ties to our European neighbours. The European Commission said the deal was fair and reasonable and that all EU citizens have the right to access the UK's welfare system. The UK has a long-term commitment to the union that includes giving EU citizens the right to live and work here. The agreement in this area is fair and reasonable, and I would expect it to be agreed over the coming months. I am confident that during this implementation period the UK will be able to achieve an agreement that reflects that commitment. ""We will continue to advocate for an agreement that works for the whole of the EU, including citizens from the UK,"" the spokeswoman said. A spokeswoman for the European Commission said it was ""preparing a response to the government's announcement"" on Tuesday. She said the commission would continue to ""seek and work with the UK government to reach an outcome that is in the national interest."" After the announcement, the BBC's political correspondent Andrew Pierce said the prime minister ""had more to say"

953,"Long Reads: Margaret Forster, The Mystery of the Past Margaret Forster was a feminist poet who believed in ""the old woman's rights"" and who believed that women must not be punished for things they don't do. Forster was in her late eighties when she published a poem called The Secret History of the Past, a short collection of essays on her life and work. It was a masterpiece of a poem about the work of her generation, published in 1930s. This was the first major American publication. They were often called the pinnacle of poetry. It was a great read in the Forster era, but its impact had not been felt until now. Forster's books have a depth and texture that is both powerful and unexpected. She has always written beautifully. She was so clever and so intellectually serious. I have always written about her poetry. She is not a typical American poet, but she was a very important poet. There are many elements in her work that are very important. She's one of the most elegant poets of the time. Not only did she write about women and men, but she wrote about us. She was so full of kindness and kindness and kindness. I have to say that she was a very nice woman, and she made a lot of people laugh. I enjoyed writing her. She was very generous, very thoughtful. She was very funny. She loved life. She had a wonderful sense of humor, which she would always give to her poems. She was a great poet. She was very generous, very caring. Her poetry was never intended for criticism. It was considered a work of fiction and it was considered important for her to be used as a valance. It's a poetic thing in a way. You see it in fiction and you see it in poetry and you see it in poetry, and you get it from people who were very close to her. And she wrote about a lot of people. She's just a fantastic poet and a great poet. I think she had the greatest poetry of her era. She was just the most beautiful human being in the entire world; she was in everyone's hands. Nobody could ask for anything better. The Secret History of the Past Margaret Forster: 111 pp., $29.95 Read more The Secret History of the Past Margaret Forster"
954,"Have Your Say!, BBC1 - TV review: How do you tackle issues head on? Our new series of Have Your Say!, about an eight-year-old who gets a chance to get an education in a five-star hotel, is a far cry from the unrealistic dream of the BBC - but many of its challenges did have an audience. What's so lovely about the show is that it offers a real insight into the challenges we will face in the world of work. It also deals with real-life concerns about the way we work; and it's pretty clear that they're not all pretty grim. In the first episode, the former head of the BBC's social policy unit, Paul Johnson, was faced with the difficult task of helping the family of a young man who attacked his young son but survived. But Johnson's challenge was not just persuading the police to investigate the incident, but also meeting the man's father, who said he had heard from someone who had been attacked by a man. But it was also dealing with a real problem: why did someone, in that situation, not try to help? Is this another step in the right direction, or just another step towards tackling the real issues? It's a mixed bag. There are not many real-life stories on the BBC's programmes; the other two are more about the real issues affecting people like Johnson. And there are so many of them that the programme avoids telling them. But I found myself looking through these scenes and feeling like I had some sense of what the characters were going through and wondered if they might be too scared to speak out if they had to. I haven't had a chance to try out the new series, but I have been encouraged by the way that the programme has opened up this debate. It has brought me to the most important point, which is that it also means that the BBC is willing to help people face difficulties. That's a crucial point. BBC management have a duty to do more to help people face challenges, and it's essential that they help people face challenges in a timely and effective way. It would be great if the series could be a start. Have Your Say! begins on Tuesday 7 November at 9pm on BBC1. Have Your Say! begins on the BBC on Wednesday 8 November at 9pm on BBC2. Have Your Say! starts on Tuesday 9 November at 9pm on BBC2"
955,"BBC News - How one British man is setting up a digital bank 24 January 2014 Last updated at 00: 08 Help When Paul Wilson, 30, started giving online banking a go back in 2008, he was so fascinated by the technology that he decided to set up a digital bank. In 2010 his bank, which is based in London, was taken over by Barclays, and he and his friends became the first in the UK to launch their business banking app. ""I wanted to create an app that would be easy to use,"" he explains. After the failure of an earlier attempt, Mr Wilson started the idea of creating a global bank that would be cheaper and easier to manage. He and his friends have now brought in more than $2m (£1.3m) in venture funding and have launched a new company called Pure Digital Global, which uses text to pay for and process transactions. This was a way of creating a bank that would allow customers to pay for items they want, and then borrow from the bank's website to buy and sell them. Mr Wilson was inspired by a story in the Daily Telegraph last week on how a small bank in Switzerland got into difficulties last year after a man raised money for it. ""The thing that struck me when I was first asked to start the project was the way that the banking system worked,"" he says. I would walk into a branch and I would see a cheque for a customer who had run up a loan that had gone wrong and hadn't paid its balance to the bank. But it became clear that the majority of banks in the UK were not suitable for that kind of thing. So Mr Wilson decided that his app, which uses the latest technology, would be very useful as well as a way to pay for items that might be more convenient for customers of the banks they do business with. He says the app is aimed at people who are also banking on the internet, and who might not otherwise have been able to access banking services online. The app is available free by downloading from Apple App Store, Android Market and Google Play. Pure Digital Global is based in London. You can follow the company's progress on Twitter at @ Pure _ Digital _ UK. Find out more about the technology at BBC World Service. You can also follow us on Twitter at @ BBCWorld _ News.

They're now the first team to ever win consecutive Paralympics and world championship titles in four years. One of the best on the court, Ryley Batt, said it's been the best day of his life.'I really shouldn't say that, because I'm married, and the wedding day is meant to be the best day of your life. But I think the missus would agree, 'he told Sky News. Batt, who scored 27 goals suffered an injury on court, but didn't seem to care. First of all I was in a lot of pain because my shoulder almost popped out. But who cares? Months off now, we're two-time gold medallists,' he said. While the Aussies had a good lead in the fourth quarter, they made a few blunders that the US were quick to capitalize on, pushing the final into overtime. In the final seconds of over time Australia managed to score once more, equaling the US and pushing them into a second round of overtime. In the end, The Aussie's raced home with a one point lead, winning 59-58. The Australian gold was the final medal presentation at the Rio Paralympics. Australian captain Ryan Scott said the win was even sweeter because it was over the United States.'There was always an asterisk over us because we avoided the US in London, but we wanted this, 'he said.

958,"BBC News - No change to UK's alcohol-free limit for women Drinking is a ""social construct"" in many ways, said Dr Ros Altmann, director general of Saga. ""Although we are not advocating a reduction in alcohol consumption, we have concerns about the impact of alcohol on women and family life,"" she said. In addition, for many women, the economic impact of alcohol consumption has been well documented. For example, the rate of alcohol-related deaths in the UK is higher than in most of the European countries in terms of life expectancy. For example, the number of pre-term births in the UK is lower than in all other European countries compared to European countries. But she added: ""In the UK, over half of all early-life pregnancies are unplanned."" The chief medical officer for England, Sally Davies, said: ""The public wants to know what's happening. However, there are still areas which currently have no alcohol limits for women, and they need to accept a change in the law. Dr Altmann added that"" the public's trust in government is at an all-time low, and the public also expects more and more alcohol to be consumed. ""Although the number of alcohol-related hospital admissions is falling, the levels of alcohol consumption are still on the rise. In 2011, 47,654 hospital admissions resulted from alcohol consumption, slightly fewer than in 2006. This figure is expected to rise to 67,099 by 2013, the report predicted. In the absence of alcohol restrictions in Scotland, the annual figures would have seen a rise of 97,590 cases, the report said. However, the average age of people who died from alcohol-related causes in England and Wales was 26 in 2011-12, up from 24.4 in 2000-01. It means that the number of deaths caused by alcohol rose from 110,440 in 1995-96 to 61,250 in 2011-12. The average age of smokers aged 25 to 44 rose from 33 to 36, the report said.. However, the proportion of people aged 85 and over who were prescribed alcohol declined from 87% in 1997 to 62% in 2011-12. In the same period, the average age of smokers aged 45 to 44 increased from 44 to 43, while those aged 44 to 46 increased from 28 to 44. The average age of people who reported smokers aged between 16 and 44 was 75.5 in 2011-12."

960,"Middle East conflict puts the world in a hurry Middle East peace talks in Saudi Arabia last month produced no breakthrough, with just over two-year tenure at stake. But tensions are expected to rise. It would be a disaster if it had been any different. Middle East peace talks in Saudi Arabia produced no breakthrough yesterday, as the latest round ended deadlock. Saudi Arabia is also locked in an escalating war in Yemen. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates intervened militarily in Yemen's civil war in 2015 to help the government push back Houthi rebels. As part of the agreement, Saudi Arabia and the UAE provided $150million in aid and personnel to the Yemeni government. But the conflict has escalated in recent weeks. Saudi Arabia is leading the war against the Houthi rebels and has begun bombing the rebels' positions in Yemen. The UAE continues to support the rebels in Yemen, but Saudi Arabia's King Salman has played a key role in the conflict too. The UAE's role has become significant in the region following the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Last week, it was revealed that the Saudi crown prince had ordered the killing of Khashoggi by a Saudi hit squad, in a diplomatic blow to the Saudis. Meanwhile, Yemen's Houthi insurgents have been advancing towards the capital Sanaa in recent weeks. A war monitor claimed on Tuesday that coalition air strikes had killed dozens of civilians, including women and children, in the city of Saada province in south-east Yemen. The monitor, known as the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said coalition warplanes had dropped barrel bombs - small weapons that are often dropped over a wide area - into the area. The city lies near the border with Saudi Arabia and is home to a major oil refinery. It is already a stronghold of the Houthis who seized Sanaa in September, forcing President Hadi to flee the country and forcing most of the country's military to withdraw. A Saudi-led coalition has been bombing the Houthis militarily in the last two years, but some of the strikes have been targeting different groups within Yemen - meaning the conflict is likely to be exacerbated by the presence of Saudi Arabia in the country. While the rebels have a prominent position in Yemen, Saudi Arabia is known to have supported the Houthis on numerous occasions."
961,"BBC News - Rising global sea levels could raise sea levels by 3.6m by 2050 - report A rising sea level of up to 3.6 metres (10.6ft) could raise sea levels by as much as 12m by 2050, according to a new study by a group of scientists. A report by the BBC's environment correspondent Jonathan Amos and a team from the University of Exeter has been commissioned to look at the threat of rising seas caused by climate change. They conclude that increased warmth could add up to 10 billion tonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere every year, which will lead to a sharp rise in global sea levels by the century's end. But the report also says that rising seas could have a serious and lasting effect on marine life. The report describes the most likely scenario as rising seas will cause more rapid melting of the atmosphere, releasing more carbon into the atmosphere and higher sea levels. The authors of the new report say that, while the impact of rising seas is ""relatively small,"" they believe the effects are far more widespread. ""The risk is not as great as we thought,"" said Professor Ian Gill of the University of Exeter. But they added that rising seas could add up to more than 2bn tonnes of carbon to the atmosphere every year and cause a ""real and substantial increase in sea levels."" The report, published in the journal Science, also suggests that if sea levels rise by up to 1.4m (3.6ft) by 2050, there will be an additional 8bn tonnes of carbon release into the atmosphere. The report recommends that countries take urgent action to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit. But the authors say that action must be taken urgently, as a lack of new technologies could delay the process and make the problem worse. What happens to our oceans? How will it change? BBC environment correspondent Richard Taylor said: ""The report is the latest sign that climate change will probably have an impact on the cost of living and the economy of the world's largest country. If the same trends continue and the world's economy is slowed by the potential extinction of the giant pandas at the end of the century, the cost of living per person will rise by 9% for the next 30 years - and as many as half of the world's population will become unemployed.

The Met Office has issued a yellow ""be aware"" warning for snow, covering most of Scotland, the south west of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It said temperatures could top 5C (4F) in some places, and could reach as high as 20C (68F) in some places. A yellow weather warning for snow for parts of Scotland is in place until 14: 00 on Sunday. It was later extended to cover much of the whole of England, with much of the south west expected to get snow. The Met Office said: ""A yellow weather warning is in place for snow, snow or ice for parts of southern Scotland, northern England, north Wales, south west England and parts of Northern Ireland, with disruption possible. Snow, sleet and hail will be difficult to clear away and will be more frequent and heavy across some high ground. Wintry showers will lead to frozen road, rail, air and ferry services, especially on some ferries and sailings. Some bus services have been cancelled, including on routes to Edinburgh and Strathclyde. The ice and wintry conditions made for hazardous conditions for drivers. Police said there had been 68 collisions on the A9 between Inverness and Perth, including those on the bypass. A spokesman said:"" Motorists have been warned to take extra care and consider for other road users and drivers. ""Police Scotland also warned motorists to be wary of debris on the road.

The Times said that ""new tactics to deter crime"" will, among other things, include ""more police"" on patrol, more surveillance cameras on city properties and the addition of 1,000 additional officers to patrol the streets. ""We will be putting our guns out in a more aggressive way,"" said Police Chief Charlie Beck. But we will ask people to be patient that we see the opportunity for success. In fact, the city plans to install about 350 more officers, Beck said. ""We are very happy to work with the mayor's office and the city to create the circumstances in which this could occur,"" he said. We will be looking at additional measures to reduce gun use and gun violence but will not hesitate to take action. The city will also hire more officers to patrol the streets in a manner that will not increase the chances of someone being hurt during a shooting. ""We need to look at what the community will be willing to tolerate,"" Councilman Paul Koretz said. And what we can do to help people who are out in the streets to protect themselves. We need to make sure that when people are out in the streets in the morning and the evening that they can come and have a good time.

967,"Global Trade in HIV and AIDS has decreased in Australia's national health budget over the past five years to $3.9 billion, from $3.6 billion in 2011-12, Cancer Council Australia reported. But the report finds the decline must be reversed if Australia is to continue to be the world leader in HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment. ""Global HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment and treatment continue to be the highest-cost priority for Australia,"" Cancer Council Australia chief executive Professor Kevin Ryan said. The report also found that one in three people living with HIV in Australia are unaware they have the virus. Of these, almost half (54 per cent) believe they are at risk of contracting the disease. But, the report found only 22 per cent of Australians know about HIV / AIDS. For more information, visit www.cancer.org.au / gb. HIV is one of the world's leading killers and the number of people affected varies widely from country to country and can be anywhere from one in every five people to one in six Australians infected. The report's editor-in-chief Dr Peter Jennings said Australians aren't ignoring the disease. ""I think Australians are ignoring the illness and the impact it can have around them,"" Dr Jennings said. HIV is a terrible disease... because it can be transmitted through sex if a person has a blood test. These numbers are really low for a disease like HIV. There are no simple ways to prevent it. We need to look at the way in which the epidemic is influencing people's behaviour and practices. Although the report, 'HIV and AIDS in Australia', is open to public comment, it is not mandatory. It is funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council, Cancer Council Australia, the Australian Research Council and the Medical Research Future Fund. The report is available at www.cancer.org.au / gb. For more information, visit www.cancerresearch.org.au / gb. People with HIV / AIDS can live for up to 40 years.

Uber launched in 2014 and is yet to make a profit, despite the fact that the ride-sharing giant is worth around $1bn. In China, Uber has been banned in a number of cities and provinces, where the driving licence is not necessary in order to operate. In Europe, the US-based company has been banned in several cities including Berlin, Cologne, Madrid, Milan and Athens. In the United Kingdom, Uber has had to suspend its services following protests against its service, which was used to provide a cheaper alternative to taxis in London. The Uber app has been criticized for operating illegally in the UK, which has not been fully regulated. Uber's UK chairman, Steve McNamara, said in March the company had suspended its UK operations to ""protect public safety."" However, the company has appealed the decision. The company said it would appeal against the decision in court. The US company has also filed lawsuits against Google in a number of European countries. Google has said that the two companies are liable for copyright infringement. During a hearing last month, the European Union's competition chief said there was no evidence that the app was not keeping up with mobile phone signals. Companies are using drones to deliver packages to customers, but they are also coming under scrutiny in the US, where the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says drone operators are operating illegally in urban areas. The FAA has also banned drone operators from flying over prisons, sports arenas, airports and airports. In the UK, Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, told MPs that it would soon be introducing ""safe flying"" technology for its London drivers. ""We're very proud of what we've been able to do there,"" Khosrowshahi said. It's like opening a new chapter in aviation globally. I think it's extremely important for what we do. He said it was ""really important"" for Uber to be ""open and transparent about our data and our operations."" ""We encourage all users to have safe, reliable and fun transportation,"" he added. Uber has faced major problems in the US, where regulators in the state of New York are investigating whether the ride-hailing service is"

The UK's entrepreneurial capacity is still undervalued, despite government initiatives to increase it. The UK has one of the most entrepreneurial populations in Europe. We're a country that prides itself on the entrepreneurial potential of its people, yet we're a nation that's still struggling to make it to the top of most people's priorities list. More than a quarter of businesses are failing to expand due to lack of funding, according to the recent Business in the Community report. The survey asked 1,600 people what they would like to see happen to the UK's entrepreneurial sector, to get the results. Mr Lowe runs a business that gives entrepreneurs a way to earn money in their first year. He has invested in a range of other start-ups including social media marketing agency Etsy, and his latest venture, a health supplement company called Bumble Bum, is one of the world's largest online supplements providers.

That would be down from May's surprise 263,000 gains, but it is still better than the 231,000 jobs lost in March. Many economists expect employment to decline further this year after a surprise gain of 214,000 in March. Traders are hopeful the recent rally in risk assets will continue.

971,"BBC News - New York subway strike: New York City subway workers in strike over pay 5 March 2015 Last updated at 11: 31 New York City's subways are set to run as normal on Saturday, but some workers who are set to take part in a strike over pay are refusing to work. The strike could disrupt the city's subway system. The Public Employees' Retirement System said it had suspended the strike after talks with the union broke down. The union has pledged to return to work on Wednesday. The city's subways are one of the world's busiest. They carry 3.4 million passengers a day and operate on almost 1,000 lines. The union has called for a wage increase of 5%. The union, which represents the city's roughly 16,000 subway station and line employees, says the pay deal it negotiated this week ""is the only solution that will work."" The union's political action committee has been set up to coordinate the walkout. Both sides have responded to the strike by warning of disruption to the public transport system. Earlier this week, the mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, warned that the city was facing a ""devastating"" budget crisis and urged workers to come back to work to support the city. ""Our job is to send a message to everybody in the city that we are not going to stand idly by and let the city waste billions on their city's public infrastructure,"" he said. The strike could also affect the federal government's budget and the Pentagon's plan to withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of this year. The city was forced to hire more than 1,000 staff on Friday over the new pay deal and its subway strike. The city said that it had to close subway stations for nine hours and reduced the number of trains so that they did not run after work. ""We are going to pay the workers"" wages this Wednesday, so we're going to help them, ""said Mr de Blasio. We're not going to try and solve the problems that the workers are facing, and we're going to help them solve the issues of that day. Other striking workers have been invited to return to work on Wednesday in support of the striking workers. They have not yet been to work on the lines. The city's Department of Employment and the mayor have not commented on the situation. US media reported on Saturday that the Department of Homeland Security had turned down a request for help from the union."

The world should not forget that we stand with the world's children, who are too young to understand what is happening, and who are living a precarious existence that is not only hazardous but dangerous. The United Nations has made a commitment to our children about education and this commitment is shared by all countries. We agree with the United Nations that education must be a priority for everyone. The Secretary-General is committed to ensuring that all children have access to education, and that, if necessary, we will make this a reality where the situation is made better. In all, 17 million children, about 7.7 percent of the population, need to be taught about education and the global community must work together to achieve this goal. As I have made clear, we will continue to work with the international community in order to improve access for all children and school-age children. I urge all heads of state to meet their commitments and pledge to work together to improve the lives of all children. The United Nations will continue to work with countries and international organizations to improve education. We will continue to work with our partners in the international community to ensure that all children's lives are protected. I am very much looking forward to the Secretary-General's visit to the United Nations. Next year, I will be joining you at the UN General Assembly in New York City and sharing my experience of working with the UN to address global education. I will also be meeting with many young people around the world and sharing our perspectives on global education. I am very much looking forward to seeing you.

It is also estimated that the combined GDP of the UK and Scottish economies will be £232bn by 2027, while Scotland could still have a GDP of £242bn by 2027. The Scottish Government has said it would like to see more countries use the Games as a springboard for a £70bn investment in sports and recreation facilities across Scotland. With the games taking place in cities from September to March, the Scottish government has said it will continue to work with a range of partners such as the London 2012 organising committee to explore the possibility of a ""legacy"" Games. The Scottish Government said it would like to see the Games ""grow into a major sporting celebration."" It said: ""There is no doubt that Glasgow is continuing to grow from a prosperous environment with the Games, and Glasgow 2014 will become Scotland's first major sporting event. We look forward with greater confidence to the UK hosting the Games in 2016. We have been working closely with the UK Government and other international partners in the past to raise the profile of Scotland's contribution to the Games and to drive growth. We have also made great progress on the challenges of setting up a lasting legacy for the city of Glasgow for the benefit of all our citizens. It is important that we continue to do all we can to help ensure that the games are a success. We would like to thank everyone who has helped to make the Games a success. We recognise that the games must be seen to be successful, but we know that they cannot be ignored.

Sanders was speaking to thousands of supporters at the Anaheim Convention Centre ahead of Saturday's third-quarter primary. Here's what he said: ""On Monday, I am proud to say that we are winning the generational debate, and Bernie has said that he intends to be a champion of the Democratic Party. That's what he will do. He intends to win the White House. And that's not going to change. He intends to fight in every single state and every state in the country. He intends to make sure that every single state, every single office in the United States has a voice in that debate. Sanders also told the crowd:"" We are winning the generational debate. ""He went on to say that"" a majority of Americans are not ready to elect a Democrat president, ""but"" I will keep on fighting for every American. ""Sanders became the first Democratic presidential candidate to call on Democrats to unite behind his campaign. He also told the crowd:"" Democrats are the party of the people. We must defeat the Republican nominee and unify the party. Sanders recently announced that he would not run for the White House and would instead return to the Democratic party to run as a Democrat. On Saturday, Clinton said she would not rule out running as a Democrat in 2020. She also said that she would not seek to be the country's first female president. This week Clinton and Sanders have faced a growing problem in the polls, with Clinton and her allies trailing Sanders by more than six percentage points. In an email to supporters on Saturday, Clinton said she had a ""very good night"" in Long Beach, with ""a lot of support inside the hall."" I am confident about the future. I am humbled to be here, ""Clinton wrote. But we must not allow ourselves to become complacent. We are winning the generational debate and I will continue to work hard to make sure that our party is a force for change in our country, in our country, and across the world.

There is still no official winner of the race."
976,"Cory Booker: Joe Biden endorsed by another ex-rival who will be key to winning the seat Booker has run well in a tough and Republican-leaning state with a Republican majority. He has won the endorsement of a third former colleague, former state Sen. Robert Casey, a Democrat who lost a Senate race in 2010. Booker will be a key player in the race to succeed Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer. He currently has a narrow but important lead in the polls. ""I'm going to make sure I don't lose any more of my support and will continue to do the best I can to win this seat in November,"" Booker said in a statement. The endorsement follows reports that former state Sen. Robert Casey, a Democrat, will not be seeking another Senate seat. Casey and his aides were not immediately available to ABC News. The New Jersey senator is facing a tough re-election race against Democrat Elizabeth Warren. The endorsement comes after Booker's first run for governor, in 2014, was marked by unsuccessful attempts to run against Democratic Gov. Chris Christie. Booker is the son of former New Jersey Gov. Christopher. He was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010. He was governor of New Jersey from 2006 until 2009. He is a favorite among progressives for running for the Senate. ""People want to change the world, they want to create a better world,"" Booker wrote at one stop during his first run for governor. And it is not a matter of a 'do something' or 'do anything'. It is a matter of changing the world. It is about changing the world. The senator's endorsement comes just months after Booker was endorsed by Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican. Christie praised Booker on Twitter on Wednesday. ""New Jersey Gov. Booker stands with me and my wife, Mary Pat, in opposing the President's ideological war on women,"" Christie said. His endorsement also comes just weeks after Christie announced that he will not run for re-election in 2018. Earlier this month, Booker had supported Christie's re-election against Democratic incumbent Barbara Buono. Booker is already the oldest sitting member of New Jersey's legislature, and he is considered the youngest member.

977,"Super Tuesday: Why didn't more young people vote? As a member of Congress at the age of 22, my first primary campaigning experience was a campaign rally for the Democratic gubernatorial candidate on the lawn of the Capitol. I was seated at a podium in the back row, surrounded by young girls. I was the only person actually there. In the crowd, the girls, who were wearing skirts, were in their underwear. I was standing there at the back of my chair on a stage surrounded by girls who had just been asked to stand on the sides of the balcony. I got the sense that the crowd was there to encourage the girls to stand up and vote. I explained to them that the women had to stand up and vote, and that they needed to use their voices in their democracy. I began to explain that the biggest problem in America was poverty. As a young girl, I was encouraged to stand out, to speak out and to make a difference. I learned from my own experience that when I stood up and told the truth, the power was shifting. I was proud to stand up for what I believe in, not what I look like or what I don't do. I was proud of my parents for being so proud of me and for being very supportive of me. I am proud of being a woman, and I was proud to be a strong enough woman to have a voice. And that's what I had to get through, no matter how much I lost or how angry people were. I'm not going to be happy. I'm going to be angry, not angry, and I'm going to be a very angry person. We can't let that happen. But we can't let that happen. This is an issue that cannot be ignored. There are politicians who say if you have a voice, and you're angry that people feel so insecure about their vote, that you can't be trusted, then you need to stand up for it. The problem is that we've got an elected president who has failed to actually break through the gridlock that we have in Washington. What do you say to young people who have no voice to speak out and to have an effective voice? I'm not happy, and I'm not going to get fired from my job. But look, the way you get through the gridlock is a lot easier if you do it when you do it. Go out and make a difference."

""Chicken is a flavorful food, but it's not necessarily better than chicken,"" Zurcher said. The way consumers get rid of it is by eating very little. It's a complicated thing to figure out. Chicken has a natural antioxidant and a natural vitamin C that's antimicrobial, Zurcher said. But by making chicken more palatable, consumers are likely to want to eat a lot more of it. ""The evidence is pretty strong that some people are going to want to eat more chicken,"" Zurcher said. The study was published this month in the journal Agriculture. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is using the study to encourage the public to eat a plant-based diet. The advice: ""Eat foods rich in antioxidants, such as broccoli, cauliflower, kale, and cabbage. Eat fish when cooking. The American Heart Association has more on heart health.

982,"Michael Bloomberg: The world's ninth richest man who tried to run for president in 2008 At a black-tie ceremony in New York today his company, Bloomberg LP, announced its latest successes, including the sale of a stake in the now defunct Wall Street Journal. Mr Bloomberg said he would continue to work for the company, but would no longer be involved in the day-to-day operations. He said: ""I'm in the middle of a business plan now, but I'm going to continue to do it. The company said it had made a profit in its most recent quarter but was making"" little progress ""on the strategic plan to transform Bloomberg into a media and marketing company. It said it had also spent $100m to increase its market share, but said the newspaper business was"" still in its infancy ""as a result of the financial crisis. The company said it planned to invest $50m in its advertising business in the next year, and to invest another $150m in its digital division. It said it was also investing $100m in its e-commerce platform, with the third-largest shareholder, Lam Research, set to become a shareholder. The company also said that its share of those sales would increase from about 25 per cent to more than 50 per cent by 2014, with the majority of that going to"" smaller media firms. ""Mr Bloomberg said he would continue to champion his businesses, such as giving away free newspapers and making better use of smart devices."" We'll look at these strategies as innovations rather than just going for the gold, ""he said. Mr Bloomberg said he hoped to make a decision in the spring. He said he did not believe he had ever been involved in any form of campaign or financial support for a political party. Bloomberg was founded in 1969 by Mr Bloomberg and Joseph Lhota, former deputy mayor of New York, and is now the second-largest privately owned company. He was elected mayor in 2002 and again in 2008. His business empire now earns a reported $8.8 billion a year, making it the world's eighth richest man. Mr Bloomberg has been a vocal opponent of President Barack Obama, accusing him of being unpatriotic and proposing cutting taxes and the spending of government resources. Bloomberg LP is run by a team of 42 people, including 11 former executives. The company has been criticised for its efforts to recruit employees from non-profits."
983,"Super Tuesday: BBC finds Bloomberg campaign offices empty in New York BBC News has stumbled across what appears to be New York's most expensive ad office space - the office of billionaire Donald Trump. The building in Manhattan's financial district of Bedford-Stuyvesant is up for sale with the asking price from $17m (£11m) to $17m. In 2012, Bloomberg paid $3.3m for its offices on Fifth Avenue, which is behind Trump Tower in New York. Bloomberg has not responded to requests for comment. Media captionDonald Trump's new campaign office cost $17m The building was built in the mid-1990s and was renovated in 2010 with the help of a $51.5m private investment. The US billionaire is said to have spent nearly $20m on the building, including $5m for a marble staircase, a $1m for a marble bathroom and $1m for a ""minimalist"" rooftop terrace. Bloomberg News did not respond to a request for comment. Bloomberg has also purchased the former Democratic National Committee headquarters in New York's Trump Tower for $40m from the then-Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton. The former mayor bought the building in 2011 for $20m as part of the $700m deal with the financial services giant. Mr Trump's team is said to be looking to raise more money for the campaign.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The building was designed by Icahn As part of the deal, Mr Trump sold the building for $20m to a New York collector's club. The billionaire said he would donate $10m to Trump University if it could open an office in the building. The building has become a prominent Republican fundraiser as Trump has campaigned on his economic record and on his controversial anti-immigration policies. The New York Times has reported Mr Trump once called the building ""disgusting"" and ""garbage"" and spent $280,000 on a refurbishment, adding that building costs would be high for the Trump campaign. Bloomberg has made several moves to acquire real estate in the city in recent years. Last month, it acquired the offices of Frank Keating, the former New York mayor."

985,"US election 2020: Joe Biden boosted on Super Tuesday by new polls Mr Biden also raised money for his vice presidential hopes, announcing in a Facebook post that he had raised $7m to fund a surprise run in Colorado, according to The Wall Street Journal. Mr Biden had previously raised just $400,000 in February, when he announced his bid for the Democratic nomination. The Democratic hopeful who beat Donald Trump in the 2016 election is now expected to launch a campaign in both Iowa and New Hampshire. Mr Biden's campaign has already seen its fundraising in Iowa have soar from $2.4m to $4.7m. In New Hampshire, the candidate's campaign is already running television ads featuring members of the Biden clan, the former vice president's son Beau Biden and his wife Jill. The couple are expected to announce their decision to run soon. Earlier in the week, a report by Politico named California's Ted Cruz and John Kasich as the two top Republican candidates for president in states likely to vote on Tuesday. Donald Trump has been spending heavily on advertising in recent weeks, particularly in New Hampshire, the first state to vote in the primary season. He has already spent $3.8m on advertising in the state since the start of the month, according to an analysis by Kantar Media. He has also spent $45,000 in total campaign cash, compared to $81,000 for Mr Kasich. Mr Kasich spent $33,000 in the state, according to Kantar Media. Mr Rubio has spent $1.1m in New Hampshire, although his campaign has also been spending heavily on more local advertising. The state and its two largest cities has a large Hispanic population, which makes it hard for others to compete. The state's population is expected to expand by 2.5m by 2050, with the US population increasing by 3m. Mr Bloomberg has repeatedly called on the White House to move away from a single payer healthcare system for all Americans. Mr Trump has so far refused. The Republican is likely to use his visit to Congress to make a renewed push for a single-payer healthcare system, which will likely face fierce opposition in Congress. Earlier this week Mr Trump said he would like to see the US pay for part of the healthcare system, but added: ""I don't think that's the best way to go about it."" Mr Biden's campaign has targeted a small number of Republican voters, but has struggled to gain traction. A recent Quinnipiac University poll found that 72%"

The Borders General Hospital said it had been dealing with the worsening strain of the disease. It said the situation at the Hairmyres Hospital was getting worse. It said there had been a ""significant increase"" in the number of cases of the disease. The health board said the outbreak was continuing. The latest cases were confirmed at the hospital on Thursday afternoon. Dr Michael Collins, director of public health for NHS Borders, said: ""While we are not aware of a new infections report at the BGH, we are working closely with the relevant partners to ensure the outbreak is contained and brought under control. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused. The latest outbreak follows a particularly severe outbreak in November 2008, when 26 people were infected at the BGH. The last patient to be confirmed as having the flu was a man from the Lothians.

992,"Things to do indoors with your children There's a huge range of things you can do outside, from playing, to playing. One of these features is to play in a covered outdoor space, like a garden shed with a bench and a bench for kids. Another trend we're seeing is for outdoor toys, with more toys on the market than ever before. According to the Australian Toy Industry Association, toys set to be the biggest selling toy list in 2017 will be those that are designed to inspire play. There's a growing trend for parents to pay more attention to what their children are playing with, with many parents wanting extra equipment. The group's managing director, Gavin Langdon, said there were no easy solutions for parents who wanted to spend more time with their children. ""The key is to make sure your children are getting the most out of playing with them,"" he said. If they are not getting the best results from home, that is not necessarily a good thing. But there is a lot of research that shows that children are better at choosing things where they want to play. Mr Langdon said it was very important parents spend time together to help their children develop their interests without distractions. ""Children are more creative than ever, and play is a great way to help them explore new products and create new experiences,"" he said. With so many kids growing up in different environments, spending time with them is important to help build up a strong attachment; it's no wonder children are not managing their time as well as they would like. Mr Langdon said it was important to support a school and community environment, and encourage children to play outside. For more advice from Mr Langdon, visit saynotoday.com.au.

The former glamour model and TV personality has been ordered to pay the man Â £24,903 within three months... and pay a further £9,059 after he was convicted last month of more than 60 offences alleged to have taken place over a period of more than 20 years. She was found guilty of two counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child, and two counts of engaging in sexual activity in a public place. She was found not guilty of a single charge of engaging in sexual activity with a child. The former glamour model found herself in hot water earlier this year when her ex-husband, Alex Reid attacked her in an explosive Twitter rant last year. Reid launched a series of offensive comments at the mother-of-five, a former glamour model on Loose Women, after she had criticised him for his ""pathetic"" treatment of her two children. But the former model, 37, and Reid's estranged wife, who had known each other in other relationships, claimed her treatment had left them ""traumatised."" Reid was convicted of 22 charges of sexual activity with a child by a jury at Newcastle Crown Court and was due to go on trial for the first time today. His trial heard he had been obsessed with pornography, including videos showing his daughter kissing another woman. Today the judge, Mr Justice Holroyde, ordered that he send the case back to the jury after hearing written submissions from the woman and Reid. He ordered that he send all the evidence to the jury for a week of evidence. ""This is a case that everyone looks to for some answers in terms of the nature of their personal lives and it is a particularly serious matter,"" he said. This is a case that has caused a great deal of distress and anxiety to the complainant and the defendant has been told it is in her best interests to return the money. Speaking afterwards, Reid said he was ""really pleased"" with the outcome. ""I think that the judge has recognised the seriousness of these offences,"" he said. I have been to the police station and they have been very helpful. I am not going to give any further information at this stage. I am happy with the outcome and hope that the judge gives me some indication as to where I stand."

Here's what they said: ""I would think it's a woman's job. I mean, what can you do if you're not going to be a successful female. I think it's harder when you're a woman because you've got no empathy, you talk only to people. I'm not really a feminist, but I think if you do anything, they're going to see you as a female. Why not? Ms Ginsburg, 66: A pioneer of gender equality, she has twice been named one of the world's 100 Most Influential Women in the World, as well as being a founding member of the US Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund. She is a former partner at law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. Ms Grayson: Born in South Africa, Ms Grayson began working as a clerk at a London law firm in 1968. As a result, she came to know a lot of people in her profession, and made a career of challenging the perception that women were overlooked in business. Ms Grayson: She was also a co-founder of the London School of Economics, which is named after her. She joined the New York Law Department in 1992 and became chair of its Center for Investigative Reporting, later becoming general counsel of the Federal Reserve. She has also been a judge on the US Supreme Court, and spent her career in the New York City School of Law. She was appointed to the New York City New York District Attorney's office in 2002. Ms Ginsburg: I'm not qualified to judge others' personal opinions. I can't give advice on legislation. This is not my job. It's my job to make sure I'm not misrepresenting or misinterpreting,"" she said. Ms Grayson: I have no interest in being a judge. My job is to see and hear what goes on in the District Attorney's office when a city attorney tries to do his job. I don't have any interest in giving advice on policy. I may make a decision if a city attorney does not want to be there. I don't know. Ms Grayson: I know my limitations."

The number of confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus in the UK has now left nearly 800 people infected and more than 3,600 people still being monitored for the disease, according to the UK's chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson. Dr Gill added that the outbreak could not be predicted but that the latest figures were ""a very significant development"" by the organisation. As a result, the HPA has taken the unprecedented step of activating a vaccine against the virus. It is believed that a significant proportion of those affected have been found to have the virus, and the number of cases has been around 50% of the overall UK rate, according to the Health Protection Agency. Dr Emma Aylward, director of clinical services at the WHO, said: ""To date, the H1N1 virus has not spread to other countries in the Western hemisphere, and the risk to human and animal health from it is very low."" She added that the outbreak was a ""real disgrace"" to the organisation and to Britain's healthcare system. The government is considering introducing mandatory flu jabs for the elderly, young children and pregnant women. However, the Association of Chief Medical Officers says that vaccination for the elderly and pregnant women is a ""non-starter"" as there is little evidence that they would benefit from the vaccine. Dr Donaldson said that the government would ensure that ""everyone involved is vaccinated"" and that people would not be forced to pay for their services. ""A vaccination programme is essential,"" he told the BBC. He said that there was a need for urgent action to prevent the spread of the virus and to help contain it. On Monday, the World Health Organisation reported that 1,018 new cases of the swine flu virus had been confirmed in 66 countries. It is the highest number of cases in one week and the largest number of deaths worldwide."
996,"Coronavirus: Three reasons why the UK might not look like Italy The UK is still recovering from the devastating outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in the summer of 2014, and outbreaks of other serious diseases such as swine flu again in the first two months of 2015. But, as Dr Nicholas Carter points out, the public's confidence in the nation's health appears to have been shaken further by the outbreak of the virus at a number of local health facilities. The story is of a few dozen people with a suspected case of the virus after returning last week from a family holiday. The rest are also believed to have been vaccinated. It's not just a small number, but on a very large scale. Flu is like an earthquake. It's an unstoppable force. It can destroy a very healthy part of the human body. We're all very aware that we're facing a growing and highly contagious disease, ""said Dr Carter. So it's much more likely that we are going to come together. The majority of cases are mild, usually around a"" moderate ""level. However, some of the most severe cases are very severe. Some people have very serious complications, and medical staff will have to prepare for how many thousands of people will be affected by this. We probably won't know for weeks whether people are OK or not until they are fully recovered. So there's probably quite a lot more people going through this than we thought. The virus is a horrible outbreak of a disease and that's why we're seeing so many cases and so many deaths because you feel like you're going to die from it. But the numbers are going up, which is a good thing because you are more likely to get sick from it. The same is true with swine flu, which is a nasty disease. One of the most common symptoms is fever, and people may feel unwell, nausea, joint pain, diarrhoea, severe stomach cramps, weight loss and nausea, which is typical of the flu. If you think you are affected by the outbreak, please be aware that it is not something to be taken seriously. What you should be aware of: There have been a number of outbreaks of the disease in the UK recently, including several who are critical. They usually affect older people, people with underlying health problems and those with chronic illnesses, such as angina or heart disease."
997,"Coronavirus: How many cases are there in your area? The hospital has confirmed that there are currently more than 100 confirmed cases of the virus in the hospitals in south Wales. The figure in England is 10. There have been more than 70 confirmed outbreaks in the UK this winter with 366 outbreaks in the past 12 months. The virus is spread through close contact with an infected person who has not had direct contact with the patient. The latest statement from the NHS says there has been a total of six confirmed infections in Wales since the start of December 2014. This is an increase on the six confirmed cases since the start of October 2014, when there were nine confirmed outbreaks in Wales. Despite this, there have been two confirmed outbreaks of measles in Wales this winter. The latest outbreak of measles is in Swansea following a four-week campaign of hand, foot and mouth disease across the city. It is the most serious outbreak since 2001. There have been 32 cases of the disease in the UK since the beginning of the year and three cases in Wales so far this winter. The latest outbreak in Swansea is believed to be the second to be linked with disinfecting hospital equipment. The latest outbreak dates back to December, where 24 people were infected in a single Welsh hospital. Parents have been urged to check their children's temperature records and be vigilant with their handshakes and contact lenses after a further four people were reported to have fallen ill from measles. There have been five reported cases of measles in Wales in the past 12 months, NHS Wales has said. Incidents of measles in the UK have increased since October 2014, with the outbreak in Wales accounting for 64% of the total cases. No cases of measles in Wales have been reported outside London, according to NHS Wales. However, a patient in Cardiff became critically ill in November and has since died. Public Health Wales is urging anyone who believes they have been exposed to a measles outbreak in south Wales to speak to their GP or contact NHS Direct Wales on 0845 63 46. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""NHS Wales is currently working closely with Public Health Wales to investigate these reports."" The spokesman added that the situation was ""under control"" and there was ""no evidence of further patient contacts."" ""If you believe you have been infected with measles, please get the vaccination,"" he said. The Welsh Assembly Government is working with Public Health Wales on any new cases."
998,"Coronavirus: Europe now epicentre of the pandemic, says WHO ""The increase in cases in Europe highlights the scale of the pandemic and an urgent need to accelerate efforts to reduce outbreaks,"" he said. That includes funding for rapid diagnostics to identify new cases and to provide adequate response to new outbreaks. The WHO has said there is evidence of an increase in the number of cases linked to the virus, meaning there is now a 50-50 chance of the virus spreading to the UK and Ireland. Speaking in Brussels, Mr Towler said there were ""no proven cases of the virus in the UK, but there's a small risk because of the high numbers of people who travel."" The World Health Organisation has said there is an ""increased risk"" of a virus emerging in the UK and Ireland, and urged travellers not to travel to those countries. The UK is a hub for travellers from the region, and is the only country where the virus has not been found. It is thought the virus could have spread as far as Romania and Bulgaria. The WHO has closed airports and seaports in the UK and Ireland as a precaution, while officials have advised people to keep their personal belongings at home and avoid airports in the affected areas. People who have travelled to affected areas are being told to continue to monitor their health and to change their cover if their symptoms do not improve. Public Health England has issued advice to travellers to ""remain calm"" and to be aware of the symptoms. Dr Richard Pebody, head of global surveillance at PHE, said: ""World Health Organisation's advice to anyone concerned about this virus is to follow the normal advice of public health authorities, which states that the risk to the general population is very low. At this time, the World Health Organisation continues to advise people to limit their travel to affected areas, but there is no evidence of an increase in the virus. Public Health England has also updated its travel advice for travellers to the affected areas, and is advising them to follow the advice of the WHO."" NHS officials are advising people to stay at home and to wash your hands often, and to follow the advice of public health authorities, ""said Dr Pebody. It is important to remember that the virus can actually spread from person to person, from flea to person, from person to person, and we are on alert to it. The Department of Health said:"" We are monitoring this situation"
999,"Coronavirus: English local elections postponed for a year 25 August 2014 Last updated at 16: 20 A number of English local government elections have been postponed until next year due to the spread of a virus. The closure of schools and colleges in parts of the north and west of England and the closure of public transport services were among the reasons for the decision. The Coronavirus outbreak has affected almost 100 schools in England. The first confirmed case of the virus in the UK is a pupil at a primary school in Cumbria. Another person has died and seven people have been diagnosed with the virus in two of England's worst-affected areas. A spokesman for the North West Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: ""We are delighted that we can now work together with each of the parties to bring this virus under control. We would like to reassure the public that we continue to work closely with the NHS and local authorities to deal with the outbreak, and we are committed to protecting local health services. This will mean a full postponement of the elections until 16 September 2015, and a full review of the current situation is to take place over the coming months. It is unlikely that the number of candidates will be reduced due to the increase in numbers. The decision to postpone the elections will be welcomed by local Labour MPs who believe the county council was targeted by the virus, local media report. However, the Conservatives have denied this. The Conservatives have said they will take"" very serious action ""against the authorities in the wake of the outbreak. The party has also said it will not hold a local election until after the next general election in May 2015. The Liberal Democrats have not ruled out holding local elections in the first half of 2015. In March, the government announced that it would discontinue a £6m contract with the University of Exeter to provide a centre for infection control in Plymouth, Devon, in a bid to help prevent the spread of the virus. Under the contract, which was awarded over 10 years, the university will take responsibility for all infection control, including testing and treatment. Prof Paul Cosford, director of the British School of Infection and Global Health, said:"" We understand the strain that local authorities are facing this winter and it is important to take advice on how to reduce the risk of spreading infection to local communities. The decision to postpone the council elections is a precautionary move on the advice of the Department for Health."

I'm not sure I would have been able to go back to a normal life. As I get older I become more aware of all the things that are normal. But she was also aware that she needed to try and re-evaluate her situation. ""It took me five years to go back to the gym,"" she said. I didn't know if it was going to be working, but I realised that I'd been inactive for a while. My life has changed in a way that I never expected. I'm not sure if I'd really had a normal life as a triathlete. I'm doing the fitness in the gym, running and cycling. I'm going to enjoy everything that I do. I know there's something more that I need to do to get back to normal. But I do that after I've gone through it. My body is not as active as it used to be. It really is, so I'm trying to take as much time as possible. Perimenopause is usually a symptom of ageing - when the body loses its ability to repair itself properly. There are different types of this - it's caused by a hormone imbalance. The symptoms include pain in the lower back, a loss of appetite, loss of appetite, diarrhoea and breathlessness. It can also be a sign of a number of illnesses including cancer, diabetes and heart disease. A woman's age ranges from 50 to 77. A male's life expectancy is between 75 and 85. Due to the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, women are more at risk than men. At this point, no-one suspects that changing your lifestyle will have the same effect on your health. However, Dr Rosemary Leach, from the Edinburgh University Health Sciences Centre, is a member of the International Perimenopause Society, a group of women aged 40 to 60. She says it's important to stress that both male and female changes are just natural. ""When is common to have a minor change or a minor change?"" she asks. And if they're no longer with you, how can you feel comfortable about it? You need to be aware of something, otherwise you will never be able to go back to normal."

It shows the man with a bag of petrol on his back and a sign reading ""no more violence in the streets,"" and a gun in his hand. The image has been shared more than 5,000 times on social media in India. The man in question is a resident of Sohra.He was not part of the crowd of people who have staged protests on the streets of Delhi. But in the video the man appears to be carrying the weapon. ""My only friend in this riot is my friend and I am carrying a gun in his hand,"" he says as if carrying the weapon. He then holds it up by his hands and uses it to fire at the rioters. In the Indian capital, police have arrested a local politician after he was caught on video appearing to be chanting slogans. The incident happened in the city's Azad area. The man, who was identified as Aditya Mishra, was filmed by a member of the public who recorded him shouting slogans. Sohra.Sangh reported that Mr Mishra later told police he had not meant to offend anyone. The incident came as police in Delhi tried to calm the riots in the city. At least 42 people have died in the unrest since the start of the year, according to figures from various government agencies. The police estimated that more than 20,000 people had been injured. On the streets of Delhi, some protesters said they feared Mr Mishra's claims that he was taking part in the riots were trumped by proof that he was part of their group. The chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir state, Omar Abdullah, has called for a meeting of government heads to discuss the crisis. He has been meeting with the chief minister and community leaders to address the issue. The chief minister also suspended the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state and two of the state's top officials. India has seen a series of riots across the country in the past few months, culminating in a school in Delhi being set on fire by angry mobs. In the eastern city of Odisha last week, a girl was stabbed to death, allegedly by a gang of about 20 young men."

We are working closely with the authorities to ensure that the general public is kept up to date with any developments. This has been a very frightening time for everyone at Glastonbury. We are doing everything, from providing hotel rooms to providing food handouts and working with local authorities to support our festival-goers. Word of the announcement was revealed on Twitter on Monday evening. The festival's management confirmed to the BBC that they had identified the site that will host Glastonbury on June 26, and said they had been in touch with the affected festival, who are now in a rebuilding stage. Glastonbury's website stated that"" the festival will host an exciting and family-friendly concert, live music and a variety of other entertainment on the site.

According to official data, the number of people who attended Glastonbury last year totalled 48,069 - a figure which is expected to rise to 55,000 this year. While no cases of the bug have been reported, it is very likely the illness caused by norovirus from a rainwater cooler at the Glastonbury Festival last year will have returned to the area in time for the event. It is not yet known whether any other camping sites have been impacted by the outbreak. Earlier this year, the Government launched an urgent review into how people and food supplied at the festival could be at risk from the illness, amid fears that this year's festival could be in jeopardy if the outbreak worsens.

The pasty shop would be built on the Carlin Trail between Havant and Truro. The council is set to decide in December whether to go ahead with the proposal. Cornwall Council is due to give the go-ahead for the proposed pasty shop in March. The council's cabinet member for planning and regeneration, Councillor John Hinds, said the pasty shop would provide fantastic opportunities for local residents. He said: ""It would represent an exciting opportunity for the area as a whole to develop a food business."" Under the government's plans, local authorities would have the final say on the development. This is the second pasty shop the council has owned. It opened on the banks of the Truro in the late 1990s and is still run by a different company. The plans for an independent pasty shop were revealed in a government plan for the market earlier this year. It also promised that the market would be improved by introducing new facilities and offering more local takeaways. In June, the council had recommended that it may not take the proposal forward unless the government made a commitment to build a new pasty shop at Truro. But Culture Minister, Barbara Follett, said: ""We were informed by Cornwall Council this week that the local authority would not enter into a planning agreement with Greggs. The council has been clear from the outset that it does not want to enter into a planning agreement with Greggs. The council has said that if it were to enter into a planning agreement with Greggs it would have to give permission to the local authority. The pasty shop would be located on the Carlin Trail between Havant and Truro.

The council's planning committee will discuss the plans on 6 December. If the proposals go ahead, it is expected to consider the plans in the first half of 2016. Construction of the pasty shop is expected to start in the summer of 2016. The pasty shop is expected to be built on the Carlin Trail between Havant and Truro.

I think they're doing a good job here,"" said one woman. ""This is more proof that we are here to serve the community and we just have to get the message out there,"" said another. ""We need to make sure we are able to provide what we need,"" said another. It's a community problem that needs to be addressed. We're still here and we need to do this. We want to make sure we have decent facilities to offer a really good service, ""said one of the women. The Women's Institute and Newcastle City Council have been approached for comment. A spokesperson for the Women's Institute said:"" The women's institute can confirm there are a number of work opportunities in Newcastle, in conjunction with the local council, and that there are no plans to close the institute. The situation at the institute is currently being monitored and has not changed. As with all public buildings, it is not possible to comment on individual cases."
1011,"Bristol sisters aim to raise awareness of 'honour hate' 14 December 2013 Last updated at 12: 31 A group of women from Bristol who have set up a charity for honour killings have launched a new campaign. The group, Be a Hero, aims to raise awareness of ""honour killings"" and to encourage people to speak out. The sisters from the city want to raise the profile of honour killings and encourage people to be more sensitive when reporting them. Jayne and Lucy, who have raised more than £5,000 for the charity, said they wanted to use their experience of being killed in Kenya to draw up new ways of holding to account perpetrators. ""We have been forced to walk hand-in-hand with a lot of abuse and violence for our children,"" said Jayne. We want to raise awareness and to encourage people to speak out against the act of honour killing while we are in Kenya. Now we are going to Kenya and we want to be a voice in the streets of Nairobi. Jayne and Lucy say they hoped their approach was more effective than the brutal methods used by Kenya's criminal gangs. They have been supported by the media, they say, and hope to set up a website - to get donations and the publicity they hope will attract more support. They also want to improve the lives of those who have been killed and buried by their killers. ""I was in an abusive relationship with my mother and sister but I want to tell them that we don't want to live in a society where there is no justice,"" Jayne said. I want people to understand that there's no such thing as a sacrifice. You just get a chance to walk into a room, you will think about it and think about it. So what I want to do is to take away the idea that you won't be forgotten. That it's a privilege. The mother of Lucy, Jayne and Jayne says the ""honour killings are still happening and the family is still afraid of what's going to happen to them."" She hopes the campaign will help raise awareness of the issue. ""It is not just for the sake of her family, it is also a chance for us to raise awareness of the issue,"" said Jayne. It is not just about the family but it is also about the victim. It is not just about the family but it is a chance to raise awareness. Be a Hero is on BBC Radio Bristol at 21: 00 GMT on Monday 28 December."
1012,"Smart motorways plan aims to boost safety Research has shown that one in five accidents at motorway speeds are caused by cyclists, but researchers are determined to improve the safety on many of the nation's main roads. Researchers at Cardiff and Vale University have been studying the impact that motorists' braking can have on road safety and traffic conditions in Wales. They say that many drivers are unaware of the benefits to their car and the roads are likely to be vulnerable in the event of a crash. But they also say there is a need for the government to find ways to improve safety on some key roads. The scheme has been run by Cardiff University's School of Transport, and the Welsh Government says they are keen to do even more. ""We want to go beyond simple safety measures,"" said a spokesman. The idea is to increase the awareness on how not to brake and how to interact with other road users. Other studies have shown that motorists who are the worst offenders on the most heavily populated roads are most at risk of crashing. The project has been funded by the University of Cardiff, the Welsh Assembly Government and the Welsh Cycle Industry. It will be carried out on a pilot basis and is expected to be rolled out across Wales. The Welsh Government has said it will consider other road safety measures, including using the National Cycle Network to help reduce traffic accidents, and introducing a congestion charge. ""I want to ensure that the majority of motorists will always be safe at the wheel,"" said Ms Willetts. The scheme will be followed by a trial in London at a later stage. The research, in partnership with the Road Safety Trust, published in the Journal of Transport Research, was supported by the Road Safety Foundation, the Mid and West Wales Road Safety Foundation and the Department for Transport. This is a public-private partnership, funded by the University of Cardiff and the University of Cardiff. It is hoped that its research will lead to improved road safety in Wales. It is hoped that it will improve road safety by reducing the number of injuries on our roads. The research has been funded by Cardiff University, the University of Cardiff, the Welsh Assembly Government and the Welsh Cycle Industry Network. The Trust was made up of Welsh Government, Transport Research Laboratory, University of Cardiff, St Mungo's University and the University of Wales. The scheme was published a year ago. It is due to be completed by the end of the year."
1013,"Chelsea Manning case: Judge orders release from prison in Texas 26 May 2013 Last updated at 05: 58 A US federal judge has ordered the release of the soldier who was convicted of leaking US secrets to WikiLeaks. Chelsea Manning, who is serving 35 years in prison for leaking classified documents, had been held at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, since her arrest in 2010. President Barack Obama commuted the sentence of Manning, who gave herself the name Bradley, and said she was ""held inhumanely."" Manning is due to be released in July. The 33-year-old is known as an activist who leaked hundreds of thousands of classified military and diplomatic documents to the anti-secrecy organisation, including military and diplomatic documents, before being arrested in 2010. Manning was found guilty of 11 of 22 charges, including espionage, theft of government property, theft of restricted military and diplomatic information and one charge of giving classified information to WikiLeaks. She also has five charges of violating the Espionage Act, which restricts the use and publication of classified material. She has been held in solitary confinement in Fort Leavenworth, her case is now likely to be transferred to the Fort Leavenworth jail after a hearing scheduled for Wednesday. Assange, who is currently living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, has called for her release. ""I have always maintained that I am innocent,"" he said. Manning was convicted of theft of government property and violating US law on espionage, although Manning has consistently denied wrongdoing. She has appealed against her conviction and her sentence. In his ruling to the judge, Mr Obama said Manning's actions had crossed a line. ""It is my hope that the court will see that she is held inhumanely,"" he said. He said the ""fact it is now nearly 10 years since she was arrested and sentenced suggests that the government in Washington has not considered the gravity of the crime or its gravity."" Manning's lawyer, David Coombs, said: ""The government has repeatedly denied ever seeking to obtain or possess classified information."" She has been held in a low-security jail at Fort Leavenworth since January 2010. She has been cleared of charges involving theft of government property and aiding the enemy. Her defence will argue that her conviction was a miscarriage of justice. Manning's release has been condemned by advocates who say she has been mi"
1014,"Guinea-Bissau: Political chaos could boost cocaine trade ""Guinea's current troubles may have heightened the risk of a regional implosion, where supply may soon be exhausted,"" Mr Dos Santos said. He said the country will take action to tackle a growing demand for cocaine by drug gangs. The UN estimates that cocaine seizures in Guinea-Bissau topped $6bn (£3.8bn) in 2012, with an estimated 225,000 tonnes intercepted by police. ""This is the biggest cocaine seizure in the country's history,"" Mr Dos Santos said. There will be lots more drug runners coming to Guinea-Bissau. The people of Guinea-Bissau are used to these kinds of criminal activity. Guinea-Bissau is well known for the trafficking of cocaine, with almost all traffic from Africa crossing the border. President Bissau is facing a crucial July 30 general election in which his socialist party is expected to come second. The UN estimates that the cocaine trade has been worth $18bn globally since 2005, with many of the illegal drugs transported by sea. The government has been cracking down on human traffickers, who use the country's coastline as a base for their operations. Last week the European Union approved a new trade embargo against Guinea-Bissau. It is hoped that the new measures will be enough to clamp down on the traffickers. The economic crisis - blamed on the collapse in commodity prices - has triggered a drop in world commodity prices. The UN estimates that the country is still to recover from a devastating 2009 earthquake. According to the president, a government of national unity has been in place since 2003, but the current political turmoil has led to a decline in trade. This has led to a decline in the level of economic activity. In 2009 we were the world's biggest exporter of cocaine, but the last five years we've been one of the world leaders in the export of cocaine. This is going to be a very difficult situation for the country, ""Mr Dos Santos said. Guinea-Bissau was a Portuguese colony until 1882, and it has been the largest cocaine exporter in the world. It is one of the least developed countries in the world, with many of its citizens still living in poverty and deprivation. The country's banks are closed and people are unable to send money to relatives abroad."
1015,"Smallest dinosaur found 'trapped in amber' Scientists say the discovery of a new vertebrate is significant for the dinosaur's history. The teeth have been missing since they were removed from the skeleton of what is now the largest sauropod dinosaur ever found, the Diplodocus ichthyosaurus. The site in Alberta, Canada, is not far from the dinosaur's current home, but is just an inch away from the site where the skeleton was found. The new dinosaur was so small that it is called a toothless dragon, researchers said. Dr Mike Howatt, from the University of Alberta's Museum of Natural History, said: ""This is the only complete specimen of the original specimen of the toothless dragon, so a significant discovery for the dinosaur's history."" The teeth belong to the same family as the adult fossils previously found at the site, suggesting they were not actually on display. The discovery of the specimen, known as a Diplodocus ichthyosaurus, is only the latest in a series of new fossil discoveries. Experts believe the new fossil, which consists of four teeth, could be the largest yet discovered in the world. The new dinosaur had a wide mouth and a nose, and it had a large head and a lower jaw than any of the dinosaurs known. It had a skull, a spine, rib-cage, pelvis bones, and a large tail, although the scientists say there is still a question as to whether it could even be a smaller or a much larger one. The fossil, estimated to have been 25 to 30 feet long, has an ""unusual"" snout along the arms and shoulders. Dr Howatt said: ""These find are the only forms of sauropod teeth found in the Alberta region.""

The council said the move had been precautionary due to an increase in cases of the virus. It said the virus had ""come into being"" and that the children and staff at the schools had been ""absolutely advised to stay indoors."" It added: ""We are aware of the increased risk around the school and the school is closed until further notice."" All pupils and staff have been kept in education accommodation during the closure. Image copyright Google Image caption The school closed on Friday afternoon while the council carried out investigations and cleaned the nearby grounds An NHS Borders spokesman said: ""An outbreak of the virus has occurred at an entrance to a school in Hawick. The risk to the general public has now been removed. The NHS Borders website adds that the infected school is closed until further notice. It is understood that some pupils, staff and pupils were kept in education accommodation throughout the closure. A council spokesman said:"" Following an outbreak of a coronavirus at St Joseph's Primary School on Friday, a notice was issued asking those who had not yet caught or been exposed to the virus to keep their child and staff informed of the action. At the same time, all emergency patients being kept in education accommodation have been tested as part of an ongoing investigation into the outbreak. We have been liaising with the Health Protection Agency and Borders Council closely. We are currently working closely with the HPA and Borders Council on the current outbreak and we have asked all affected families to remain indoors while we carry out investigations to establish the cause of the outbreak. The council's health director Dr Tony Wallace said: ""Local Authority Borders have been informed of an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syncytial virus (SARS) following an outbreak of the virus at a school of primary school in Hawick. We will be working closely with the HPA and Borders Council to offer any support and advice to those affected. Public Health England is advising people to keep their windows and doors closed."
1018,"Coronavirus symptoms: What are they and how do I protect myself? Anyone with symptoms of the disease, such as a fever and a runny nose, that is currently spreading, is advised to avoid close contact with people who are at risk. Anyone who has had contact with anyone who has had possible E.coli strains should stay at home and wash hands with soap and water as they often carry the virus. Meanwhile, people should remain vigilant in the community, where there is any evidence of the illness to prevent it spreading. The symptoms usually take about six to nine days, and have a very severe impact on people's physical and mental health. If you are unwell do not visit your GP or pharmacist. Swine flu: why are the symptoms so frightening? The virus is difficult to spread, so it is best not to spread infected tissues or contact others who have been in close contact with the virus. In recent weeks, thousands of people have been infected with the virus, and the number of people likely to be infected is expected to increase as the epidemic spreads. The World Health Organisation said on Sunday that it is ""extremely concerned"" about the epidemic and the spread of the disease in the UK. ""We are concerned about a situation that is very similar to what we saw in the autumn of 2012, where we found evidence that the virus was circulating through the community,"" said the head of the WHO, Margaret Chan. The virus has spread rapidly and has already claimed the lives of over 400 people: 35 in the UK and 13 in the US. Symptoms of the virus can include: fever, chills and muscle aches, sore throat, nausea and vomiting. For most people, this is a mild illness, but if you are unwell, or you feel weak, you should call 999 straight away. There is no need to see a doctor. If you are tired, you should take any antibiotics you are given and get on a ventilator. If you feel unwell, go to your GP or pharmacist for help. The virus is most common in children, but especially in older people, pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems, such as the elderly. It can spread through close contact with an infected animal, or through sharing food or drink, or through contact with infected people. Symptoms can include: diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting."
1019,"Coronavirus information: What should I do? The virus causes the common cold and can be nasty, especially to the elderly, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems. It is most common in children and people with weakened immune systems. However, people should not be complacent. If you experience any of these symptoms, you should see your GP immediately. The symptoms can start and end up appearing at any time during the day and you may be able to improve. You may also need to take anti-viral medication to control the virus. The exact cause of this illness remains unknown but it is thought to be linked to a food or drink which is contaminated with the virus. It's worth checking with your GP to be sure if you have any of the following: Severe stomach cramps Nausea and vomiting Anxiety and restlessness Sore muscles and tenderness Breathlessness Mascara or cough Sore throat or tonsillitis Sudden changes in bowel habits or diarrhoea Loss of appetite or weight loss Weight loss Blood in urine irritation or bleeding Severe hearing loss Loss of limbs or ankles Bowel and bladder irritation Source: NHS Choices and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention She added: 'People should be aware that if they have been in contact recently with the same symptoms, you should see their GP immediately if you notice any changes. If you haven't, then it's best to get them checked out as soon as possible. The sooner you get someone checked out the better. As the infection progresses the more serious it becomes. This is a very serious condition and it's impossible to diagnose because the infected person does not have any symptoms of any other illness. Anybody with any of these symptoms should be checked out straight away. If you're not sure whether you're pregnant or have been in contact with the hospital, or are concerned about your baby, you should be able to get antibiotics to reduce the chances of developing infection. If you've been in contact with the hospital, or if you're worried about the virus, you should get your hand seen immediately. If you're not familiar with the symptoms, talk to your GP.'

In addition, all other airlines have a responsibility to the UK Government and the Department for Health. However, passengers in the UK who have purchased tickets online are responsible, and if they have bought a travel insurance policy (as well as a package holiday), they are liable to cover the costs of their trip, and their insurance is valid for travel within the UK, but not for ""any kind of individual or group."" They are also fully protected against outbreaks. People should cover their own hand, cover clothing and other essential items with their hands, and wash hands very thoroughly, and seek medical assistance if they develop any symptoms. The Department for Transport urged travellers who have bought travel insurance to take the following steps: Cover your hand with your hand when you travel, and contact your GP or hospital if you think you or your family have been affected. Avoid contact with anyone who has disembarked from the cruise ship. Contact your doctor for advice if you are concerned. Make sure you have been fully vaccinated and wash your hands after returning home. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you are in the water, and avoid contact with any sick or dead animals or ground pests. Use a tissue when you are in the water or in the air to cover your mouth and nose. You should wrap a towel around the person you are sharing the hotel room with. Do not take any drinks or food that has come into contact with the hotel room, or drinks you may have. If you have an infestation or have ever been in contact with rabbits or birds, you should wash your hands with soap and water, and make sure you wash your hands thoroughly. If you have other questions or concerns, you should contact your airline. Source: World Health Organisation The Department for Transport says it is working with the UK Government.

1021,"Coronavirus: Europe now epicentre of the pandemic, says WHO Europe's outbreak of the coronavirus is now the world's most urgent disease, the World Health Organisation said on Wednesday. The virus was first detected in Thailand in 1996, and already has infected more than 100,000 people across the world, the WHO said. That is about 200 people a day infected, it added. The WHO has set up a hotline, 0800 096 0294, for people to report concerned friends or family members. The main priority now is to establish and trace the source of the outbreak, to prevent a potential pandemic, the WHO said. There are 1,077 confirmed cases in Europe. The WHO has made great strides in identifying the source of the infection, even if it only begins to appear in countries such as Denmark, Switzerland and the US. The number of suspected cases also has fallen significantly, from 3,597 in 2007 to 3,581 last year. The number of confirmed cases has increased from 433 to 704 in 2006. In all, there were 14,363 suspected cases last year, a decrease of 12% from 2007. Cases of the infection have also decreased in some countries and are now well below those of the previous peak of 118,222 cases in 2001. But there are more than 4,300 deaths a year in the WHO network, down from 62,014 in 1999 when the pandemic was first detected. In the last 20 years, the number of cases has fallen by about 19%. The WHO has said that the current pandemic is the worst it has ever seen. It has said the number of cases could go up because of more people becoming infected and more cases being detected. In addition to the millions of people who have been infected with the virus, experts have said that the virus' ability to spread easily was underestimated because it was difficult to trace the source of infection. Experts say that because the virus is spread through close contact with bodily fluids, any person who develops symptoms of the virus risks being exposed to the virus. In some cases the virus can be passed on through the blood, which increases the risk of acquiring the disease. The virus is spread over open surfaces, such as doorways, in hospitals, schools and workplaces. It is not contagious. The virus is easily transmitted between people."

1023,"The mother and the murderer who bludgeoned their son to death were sentenced to life in prison on Thursday. The mother and the killer who bludgeoned their son to death were sentenced to life in prison on Thursday. The mother was convicted of murder as part of a joint investigation between police and prosecutors in the city of Valladolid. They were each sentenced to nine years in prison. Her husband, who was sentenced to four, was given a two-year sentence for premeditated murder. Anitta Fernandez, 46, was spared a similar sentence. She insisted that her husband, Eduardo, murdered their son in self-defence. The couple are appealing the sentence for premeditated murder because of the difficulty of proving their innocence, according to reports. Police found the boy's body in a rubbish bin in Valladolid in April 2016. He was aged between 7 and 11 years old. A joint investigation between police and prosecutors has been underway since the murder. Investigators on Wednesday detained a local court official for questioning. The head of the investigating agency, Gerard Pulegrin, said the judge was able to obtain information on the incident that the suspect has been questioned on. The murder prosecutor is also investigating the suspect's actions in prison. Pulegrin said that the suspect refused to talk to investigators and then confessed to the murder. He also admitted to the murder of the boy. At the hearing, the judge read out his sentence, which included nine years in prison, saying that the murder occurred at a time when the state of Valladolid was under severe pressure, according to the BBC. The prosecutor added that the attack is especially painful. The victim's father said that his son had been beaten and tortured. He was beaten and dragged around the house, where he was tied up and left for dead, ""the father told the media. The investigation is ongoing and there are still questions to be answered, but we hope that the victim's body will be returned to her family soon. The killer's brother and two other relatives are currently serving life sentences for the crime. The family is appealing against the sentences, and the court has already overturned their convictions. The hearing was a rare joint investigation between police and prosecutors, and Pulegrin said the case was not politically motivated. This is not related to the case of Eduardo Pulegrin. He is just a man who had no connection to the case."
1024,"Canada faces' danger 'from China and Russia, intelligence chief warns Canada faces a ""serious"" security threat from Chinese and Russian spy networks, the country's top intelligence official has warned. The warning by the head of Canada's intelligence agency comes as the US and China prepare to meet in Washington this week. Jonathan Schwartz also said the country had become an important transit point for global Isil terrorists. He told a Senate committee that China and Russia were both on the international's doorstep, with both countries moving towards a ""more active role."" Mr Schwartz said the possibility of Isil-related terrorism coming to Canada had increased since the Westminster attack, in which four people were killed. He said: ""Over the past few months, there has been a significant increase in the number of such individuals who are returning to Canada, and that is a serious concern of Canadians."" The warnings come amid the tense rhetoric from Donald Trump as he prepares to meet the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at the G20 summit in Hamburg this week. Mr Trump has recently accused China of ""very good"" trade practices, and said Beijing-developed defence systems were a threat to America. Security analysts have said the US has repeatedly used its intelligence to seek better targeting capabilities. Mr Schwartz warned that if Mr Trump wants to reestablish a hard line with China on Isil, Canada would have to be prepared to take steps to retaliate. He said: ""We're facing a serious threat from these groups that are being directed by Russia and China, which are trying to influence our foreign policy - not to mention our national security."" Mr Schwartz also warned that China has ""developed a military capability,"" but suggested that Beijing's increasing assertiveness meant it was not ready to take on the new threat. He said he believed Beijing would continue with its new tactics to ""stop the flow of money and weapons to groups in Europe and North America."" Mr Schwartz said China had ""become more sophisticated and lethal"" in its efforts to identify and prevent foreign fighters and the flow of fighters through its borders, and that China's growing ""domestic threat."" He added that Mr Trump's administration was ""significantly more aggressive"" in pursuing these threats, and that the US had become increasingly frustrated with the pace of global efforts to combat Isil. He said there were signs of this emerging again in recent months. ""This has led to a spike in the number of foreign fighters coming to the US,"
1025,"US-Mexico border: Pregnant woman from Guatemala dies after fall from wall A pregnant woman from Guatemala has died after falling from a fence near the US-Mexico border. The woman, who has not been named, fell from a fence near the town of Juarez, in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. The area around the fence is popular with tourists and has been included in a Mexican government proposal to build a ""safe zone"" of some 1m (3ft) around the fence. The Mexican government has already said the proposal will address ""migratory populations"" and ""illegal immigration."" A spokesman for the Guatemalan embassy in San Salvador said there were no immediate reports that the woman had died. ""We are in contact with the government of Guatemala to determine the circumstances of the incident,"" the spokesman told the BBC. He said it was unclear whether she had fallen from a Mexican border barrier or from a border fence. The US-Mexico border crossing has seen a surge in recent months, with some 80,0000 migrants arriving in 2015 alone. According to the latest data available by the US government, a total of 43,038 unaccompanied minors were apprehended over the five-month period. In July, a pregnant woman died in the same border area when a fence collapsed in a family who were trying to cross illegally into the United States. The woman, identified as 18 months pregnant, fell about 26ft (7.5m) off an eight-metre high high wall. She was found naked and seriously injured by state police officers at the Joaquin de Aristizaga border crossing in Tijuana, on 14 July. The woman, who was 19 weeks pregnant, was taken to hospital, where she later died. The US has recently revised its policy on family planning to give priority to unaccompanied minors who are travelling more than 4,000km (2,500 miles) from Guatemala and have no place to live. The US had issued a policy in 2011 aimed at making family planning more accessible and to increase the number of young women planning to become pregnant. It said it intended to increase the number of women who have access to contraception by more than 50% by 2020. In June, the US Department of Health and Human Services told the BBC it would stop giving government grants to any family planning clinics that are not able to offer contraception. It had previously said that it would provide financial guarantees to any clin"
1026,"South African King Dalindyebo arrested after 'axe rampage' South African President Jacob Zuma has called for calm in the aftermath of an axe rampage outside the parliament building in Pretoria. The president said the incident is being treated as a ""terrorist attack."" During Friday's clash at parliament the president called for calm and said ""the situation was handled on the ground."" The attack is believed to have taken place when the president was returning from a holiday. It is the second time this week the president has been targeted in such violence. The latest incident has involved four people. South Africa has suffered a rise in racist attacks in recent years. A report in the Times newspaper on Friday claimed the country was one of the world's most racist countries. Despite this the president is expected to be sworn in on Thursday. He said he would do everything he could to keep the country safe. The country is still reeling from the killing of many anti-apartheid activists by white supremacists who targeted them in the 1980s. South Africa's Justice Minister Michael Masutha said the attack was being treated as a ""terrorist attack"" and would not stop the fight against racist violence. ""We are not afraid of it being brought to us,"" he said. Police have launched a manhunt for the assailants. There have been numerous reports of violence in South Africa in recent years. Two opposition MPs were assaulted in June and the government has been widely criticised for its response to racially motivated violence, including the use of the military against anti-racist protesters in Johannesburg in 2009. South Africa has one of the highest percentages of whites in the world, with 70.9% of the population, according to the 2011 census. The number of white South Africans living in rural areas has risen by more than 50% since the end of the apartheid era, according to government statistics. Africa is home to around half the world's white-minority populations, with black and brown colonies accounting for nearly three-quarters of the continent's population. Many black South Africans say they make up too much of the country's white majority population, but some have accused the government of not doing enough to explain their problems.

1027,"Christchurch mosques shooting victim one-year on from deadly attack A man who was shot dead by a gunman during a street attack in Christchurch, New Zealand has been remembered as a kind and loving man. The 29-year-old man was shot by the gunman at about 4.30pm on Monday as he stood near his home in the city's CBD. Police said the gunman, who remains at large, had fled the scene in a vehicle following the shooting. The man's father, who was in the house at the time of the shooting, told reporters he was devastated at the loss of his son. ""He was a very sensitive guy, that's why you never get the chance your son would be taken from you,"" he said. He was one of the nicest people you could meet. I don't know what happened, but I'm devastated. Police were called to the scene of the shooting but were unable to find the gunman. He was then killed by his friend, who was also in the home at the time of the shooting.The victim was taken to Christchurch Hospital in a stable condition. The gunman's death comes after a 28-year-old Australian citizen was charged with murder and attempted murder over the Christmas Day shooting of a 14-year-old boy in Sydney. Police said the man had been on parole at the time of the shooting. No one else was injured in the shooting. Police said the man was believed to be known to the teenager. He was arrested on Monday afternoon after a manhunt involving hundreds of police officers and heavily armed officers. The man's friends said it has been difficult to understand how someone could harm another man just days before the Christmas Day shooting. ""I'm in complete shock,"" a friend said. He was a lovely man. He was just always a good bloke. He was never a criminal. He was known to the police a couple of times. When asked if he had any explanation, the friend said: ""No."" The gunman was expected to face court on Tuesday. The Australian is expected to fly back to Australia. A post mortem that was conducted on Monday showed the man died from a single gunshot wound to the chest. Police said they still believed the shooter was still armed. The shooter has been described as Asian in appearance, aged in his mid-to-late 20s, around 180cm tall, with short brown hair and brown eyes."
1028,"Iraq base attack: US in retaliatory strikes on Iran-backed fighters The US is flying missiles at suspected Iranian-backed fighters in Iraq in retaliation for yesterday's strike, the US military said. Four planes took off from a base in Irbil and two missiles hit an Iraqi base, the military said. The US had launched dozens of airstrikes on Islamic State targets in Iraq, including the oil fields and border town of Baiji. The strike came in response to a strike on an oil refinery. It was one of the largest US strikes since the start of the Iraqi war in 2003. The strikes were part of a ""continuous campaign of air strikes"" against Islamic State in Iraq, the US military said. It said the Iraqi air force responded to three strikes yesterday, which targeted three IS targets in Tikrit and Salahuddin provinces. On Thursday, the UK and US military also conducted air strikes on two IS targets in Iraq and destroyed an Iraqi air force F-16 fighter jet. The strikes come a day after US President Barack Obama warned against further military action in Syria. The US Central Command (Centcom) said at a press conference on Thursday that the four strikes on two IS targets in Iraq targeted a ""destructive IS tactical unit."" The military said that strikes conducted overnight were launched ""in response to a destructive IS tactical unit"" and resulted in the destruction of an Iraqi air force F-16 fighter jet and a bomb factory. The statement said the strike occurred during an attack on a ""foreign"" site which ""destroyed several IS tactical units and associated equipment."" Mr Obama said: ""Our military is working to train and equip Iraqi and Kurdish forces to defeat [IS] and to prevent future attacks on Iraqi leaders and civilians."" The strikes came as the head of the Iraqi parliament said that Iran's involvement in Syria amounts to ""a strategic crime"" because it gives ""a chance to the United States"" to destabilise the country. Ali al-Dabbagh said that Iran's support for the Syrian regime was ""a strategic crime."" ""It gives an opportunity to the United States to destabilise the country,"" he said. Iranian president Hassan Rouhani has previously claimed that the US is ""acting according to the wishes of the American people"" and is trying to destabilise the region. He also said that Tehran is a ""victim of American arrogance"" as well."

Ibbotson, 45, was flying the single-engine Cirrus SR22 Piper Hawk when he crashed on Monday afternoon. Mr Sala, a father of two, was airlifted from the scene of the crash, but later died of his injuries. Investigators are now trying to establish whether the crash was caused by mechanical failure. Hampshire Constabulary said a file would be prepared for the coroner. The force said Mr Sala was a former pilot with more than 20 years' experience. ""In doing so, he took the aircraft in a 'perfect storm',"" a statement said. He was able to safely land it safely without any further problems. His family said in a statement that he was a ""much loved husband, father and grandfather."" ""Ibbotson was a much loved father and grandfather and a true friend,"" they added. He will be sorely missed by everyone who knew him. A police spokesman said Mr Sala was a retired school teacher and had flown for the aviation business for 30 years. He had been a member of the Air Accidents Investigation Branch since 1994. The aircraft was built in 1993 and had a top speed of 224mph (360kph). The AAIB said it was investigating the incident. ""Everyone on the ground is deeply saddened by this tragic incident,"" it said in a statement. The AAIB and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office have tragically lost a loved husband, father, grandfather and friend. Mr Sala was a passionate and accomplished aviator, and will be greatly missed by all who knew him. In a statement, said the family were not mourning his death, but wanted to ""thank the paramedics, air crash investigators and the police for their hard work."" Mr Sala is the third pilot to die this year in the UK, after four Britons died when their planes crashed off the Sussex coast in March. A sixth pilot, Andy Hill, is still believed to be missing. The AAIB said it was too early to say what caused the crash, but said it was particularly important to establish the cause of the crash."

Amir Jasser is arrested in Karachi, Pakistan Jasser is accused of assaulting journalist in Karachi He was arrested for two weeks after allegedly insulting the reporter Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Pakistani court Saturday ordered Amir Jasser arrested for allegedly assaulting a journalist after a reporter asked a question about the arrest of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, authorities said. Jasser, a high-profile media mogul who hosted a daily TV chat show, was arrested after allegedly insulting the journalist, said Police Inspector Farooq Khan. Jasser is accused of assaulting the journalist after he asked him about the investigation into the resignation of Sharif's son, but he is not believed to have been attacked, Khan said. Jasser is accused of insulting the journalist. Jasser's lawyer, Awadh Khursheed, denied the charges. ""Mr. Jasser was arrested,"" Khursheed told CNN. He is not accused of assaulting the journalist. He is not accused of insulting the journalist. Jasser's arrest comes more than a year after a top Pakistani judge ordered the arrest of Jasser for alleged insulting the president, the former army chief, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, and other officials during a 2003 televised interview. Jasser's arrest is part of a growing trend of prosecutions in the country for political opposition figures. Jasser was arrested in Karachi, Pakistan, on May 24 by Pakistani police who said they had evidence he was involved in blasphemy. The case is under investigation because of previous accusations against him. The move came about after he posted a message on Facebook in which he alleged that the government was behind the 2011 killing of a human rights activist in Karachi. Jasser has said he is innocent.

1031,"Thailand protest: Opposition takes to streets in rare protest 25 April 2013 Last updated at 16: 26 Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets of Thailand's capital, Bangkok, in what has been dubbed the largest opposition protest in years. The People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) said about 27,500 people gathered, but some anti-government protesters were arrested. The group said they were there to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, who was ousted in a popular vote in 2011. The government denies any wrongdoing. The protest began on Friday night, with a march of about 10,000 people. Police said they arrested about 4,500 PAD protesters and seized hundreds of weapons. The rally was peaceful but was marred by demonstrators hurling petrol bombs at police, prompting several clashes, AFP news agency reports. Government troops then cut the protesters off from the streets. In a televised address, Ms Yingluck said she had accepted the resignation of Ms Yingluck, who had been in power since 2011. Ms Yingluck said her government was sending an envoy to discuss the protests, though she did not give details. ""The government will not allow the PAD to threaten the welfare, safety and rights of any of our citizens,"" she said. The military has staged a crackdown on supporters of ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. He was accused of abuse of power and corruption during his time in office. Mr Thaksin has been living in self-imposed exile in Dubai to avoid being sent back to Thailand, where he faces a jail sentence for corruption in a controversial land deal. The anti-government protests have been ongoing since August, when anti-government protesters occupied the prime minister's offices and clashed with police. More than 90 people have died since the demonstrations began, according to Reuters. The protesters have said they want Ms Yingluck to step down but have not said who they want as prime minister. She has been prime minister since 2009. One of her opponents, Democrat Party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva, has criticised her leadership, saying she has caused the country's worst political crisis for decades. Analysts believe the protests are aimed at toppling Ms Yingluck and setting up a potential power-sharing government. The government has said the protests are aimed at breaking Thailand's fragile political order. Additional reporting by Kochakorn Boonlai"
1032,"Coronavirus: Life inside China's lockdown-shut hospitals 21 July 2013 Last updated at 00: 38 By Stephen Smith BBC News, Beijing A senior Chinese official fears the death toll from the outbreaks in China's last state-controlled hospital outbreaks could rise further. It's been over 31 days since the outbreak of the winter vomiting bug in Jinan, in the eastern province of Shandong, which killed 123 people. The government's response has been to put the number of hospitals closed at 80, which is the government policy. But only about 10% of those in Jinan have been open to the public, which has put pressure on hospital facilities. The Chinese government has declared a total of 30 days of mourning, and has ordered the removal of hospitals completely. About 3,000 people have been quarantined in schools, public buildings and workplaces, including hospitals in Shandong, the Ministry of Health said. Health workers and families are preparing for the worst-case scenario. Hospitals are being ordered to cancel routine surgeries. The number of new cases has increased to 340, the Ministry of Health said. State media have reported that most of the flu-related deaths were in Shandong. State radio has quoted an unnamed official as saying there had been a ""dramatic"" increase in the number of people affected. Shandong, which is largely autonomous, has been affected by a number of outbreaks, and experts believe many of those infected came to the city for jobs and did not go to hospitals where they still needed to be monitored. The number of people affected by the virus has been increasing, and last month it reached 1,365, the Ministry of Health said. However, it is unlikely to be enough to prevent the epidemic spreading further. The authorities have been urging people to stay away from hospitals and schools, and to avoid contact with others who are in close proximity. The World Health Organization (WHO) says the virus is unlikely to be able to spread from one region to another, and that most people infected will not develop a severe illness like the H1N1 pandemic. It predicts that about 70% of the population will eventually become infected with the disease. In the UK, the NHS says it is working ""closely"" with the Department of Health and in hospitals to establish what the outbreak could mean for patients and staff. This week the government said it would cut the number of patients admitted to hospital in the next few"

He returned from Europe on Monday after receiving medical advice. The minister denies having knowingly taken a child to a hospital without authorisation. Mr Dutton said the virus was an ""infection and not a travel-related illness."" The virus was found in a tourist who visited Australia in January. ""We have taken the decision to test for this disease,"" he added. The minister said he had made a ""very good recovery"" after ""receiving medical advice."" The virus is the same as that which caused the death of a two-year-old boy in Queensland in 2013. Since then there has been no reported cases in Australia of the virus spreading from family members to neonates and people with weakened immune systems. Australia is home to about 1.6 million people. Concerns about the virus emerged after a 32-year-old British tourist was flown back to Australia from Brazil after he contracted it from passing through the air during a flight from Heathrow to London. The man, from London, died from complications connected with the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said there is no vaccine to prevent the spread of the virus, which has killed some 200 people in the past year. The virus was first seen in south-eastern Asia in the late 1980s prompting fears that the disease could spread to Australia. Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea have all reported outbreaks, although cases have yet to be confirmed in the UK. The last case of the disease was identified in 2015 in Britain. It had also been seen in Vietnam, which had its first case and was thought to be the source of the latest case. Australia is currently considering whether to stop its citizens from coming to the country for medical treatment. There have been more than 200 cases of measles reported in Australia, with 13 of those patients having been infected overseas. A child is taken to hospital after a man in Brisbane contracted measles. New South Wales has one case, with a woman infecting a 17-month-old baby in Queensland. New South Wales has one case, with two people having the disease in the state.

1034,"Coronavirus: Three reasons why the UK might not look like Italy The UK has already been hit by two outbreaks of the disease, both in the south of England. The first was in 1995, and the second in 2003, and both came from the same outbreak in a farm in Fife. The disease is thought to have originated in the same sheep's coop where the outbreak was first reported, but the exact source of the virus is still being investigated. The disease is thought to have originated from a cow that was slaughtered and then then infected with coronavirus (H5N1). Since the outbreak of the first outbreak in 1994 the UK has had about 2,000 reported cases of coronavirus, and in 2014 there were more than 1,800 cases. The most common cause of coronavirus infection is a severe illness caused by the breathing or vomiting of a person's corpse, usually on the nose, or on the lungs. The most common means of transmission are infections such as swine flu, haemophilia and food poisoning. The symptoms of the disease are similar to those of sore throats, and include fever and headache, but are not thought to be linked to other illnesses. To reduce the risk of a reoccurrence, it is recommended that people who have recently had a pneumonia, or who have recently had a flu jab, wash their hands often with soap and warm water and get them tested for a virus. The advice is also to avoid visiting hospitals as the symptoms can be quite severe. The advice is also to look after your health such as eating plenty of vitamins and minerals, getting plenty of rest and staying clear of crowded places. The World Health Organization (WHO) advises anyone who thinks they or their children have been affected by the virus to stay at home and contact their GP. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously suggested that people with a weakened immune system have a greater risk of coronavirus. ""I would say most people will still have a good immune system,"" said Mark Poulos, Director of Public Health for the WHO. But with those who have had coronavirus they should be cautious about travelling to hospitals. These people should be monitored for symptoms, and if they are showing any symptoms they should be given the opportunity to be tested."
1035,"Coronavirus: How to clean your smartphone safely Although the potential risk of coronavirus infections is very low, you should be careful. The virus is highly contagious and can spread from a contact contact to person to person, leading to infections like the common cold. It can cause severe illness and even death. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, breathing difficulties, fever, chills and pneumonia. Some people infected with coronavirus have lost consciousness or develop respiratory problems, making them more vulnerable to the viruses. Try to quickly disinfect your phone (and hand dryers) and always use a HEPA filter and disinfectant, both of which will prevent the spread of infection. If you become sick you should contact your GP if you notice that a person with the virus has passed bodily fluids. In cases when the virus is transmitted by water, contact your doctor immediately. If you think you may have this virus, contact your GP or NHS Direct who will be able to provide you with advice on what to do. You may also need to see your GP for advice. In 2016 and 2017, there were 33,151 cases of suspected coronavirus (CHC) in the UK, of which almost half were to people aged 65 and over, according to Public Health England. This was a 37% increase on the previous year. The figures come from the Health Protection Agency. Read more: Your smartphone can spread influenza to your face, nose, eyes, ear and hands NHS chief: 'No one knows what the true risk is in your smartphone before you use it' In a statement, a spokesperson for Public Health England said: ""Our advice remains to not put your smartphone in your pocket, and to always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. If you are concerned about your health, do not visit your GP or hospital unless you are sure you have the right information to do so. This incident highlights the importance of cleaning your phone to reduce the risk of spreading infection to others. It's important that people who are not wearing gloves, hat or face masks can wash their hands regularly. The virus can also spread via hotel or hotel rooms, or from contact with someone who has recently returned from another destination. These situations can be very distressing for people because they may feel they have been exposed to the virus."

People in Kharanpur say the greeting symbolises love and solidarity. But officials in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh have also warned that the greeting may be deadly. A greeting from a village in northern Uttar Pradesh is causing thousands of illnesses and hundreds of deaths each year, health officials have said. Patients die as people are convulsed by the virus. It is thought 95% of people infected have no symptoms, while the rest show signs of a common cold. In a statement, Uttar Pradesh's health ministry said: ""There are very high numbers of cases of measles, diarrhoea, pneumonia, encephalitis and other complications for children and pregnant women."" It added that the virus could also spread to other parts of the state. ""These people are in a very remote area and the community, which has a large number of expatriate expats, is not well prepared to deal with the symptoms,"" it added. Several countries have banned the greeting from making way in India. The UK and other countries also say they are taking steps to control the spread of the disease. The only countries in the world that have passed a ""global ban"" are the United States and Canada.

1037,"Dr Anthony Fauci explains failure of testing in the US Ebola patient Dr Anthony Fauci has said an experimental drug has failed to produce any significant benefit when set up to help treat Ebola in West Africa. The US government earlier this month revealed they had failed to spot the virus by testing patients for fever and other symptoms of the virus. Dr Fauci told the BBC's World Tonight programme that a test on the drug showed little benefit. The drug, called ZMapp, is being tested for the treatment of three patients in Sierra Leone - all who have now recovered. Dr Fauci said the US government's failure to make a single case of the disease in West Africa - and it has been a tough year for the Ebola outbreak - was a ""failure."" The US is set to unveil a new strategy for the country in the next few days Mr Fauci said such efforts would have a much greater impact because it took three months to develop the trial. But he said it was ""not a failure"" to have tried ZMapp and said this was the first time a drug that had a long-term success in treating individuals with Ebola had been tested for Ebola. Dr Fauci said the US government's failure to discover the virus by investigating just one case in the US in 2013 shows the extent to which the aid effort has failed in West Africa. He explained there had been a ""surge"" of cases in West Africa, including in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with ""tens of thousands"" of people now thought to have been infected. But Dr Fauci said this was not a cause for celebration. ""This is a failure by the government,"" he said. The truth is that this is not a single case of Ebola. This is the first time that we've had this sort of a response by the government. It's not just a failure in our efforts. Earlier this month, Richard Branson, the Virgin boss, described the potential Ebola outbreak in west Africa as a ""catastrophe"" and said the world must find a way to stop it. The latest UK Ebola cases include a 25-year-old man who had recently returned from Sierra Leone. He died on 17 August in a London hospital from the illness. There have been more than 4,900 cases of Ebola in the West African countries since the disease was identified last year. The latest outbreak is said to have killed more than 4,800 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone."

But as always, there will be plenty of disgruntled fans unhappy with the way the announcement was handled by organisers. In an interview with BBC News, chief executive Hugh Robertson said that the cancellation of the GP was ""regrettable."" ""What we have done is we promised that we were going to fly the flag for the sport,"" he said. We did that, we have apologised for it, we tried to explain it to you and we have tried to explain it to you, and we have tried to explain to you our expectations. Mr Robertson said that if there were no guarantees that the cancellation would not happen, the event would take place. ""It will be a shame if it's not there,"" he went on. I've been in F1 for 35 years and this is the first GP I've ever watched. I'm absolutely gutted. I love F1 and I'm devastated and I'm sorry for the fans. But we have to remember that this is a big event, Formula One is racing which means that supporters in Australia will see it live. I hope they'll get to see what's going on. So I'm sure they'll be able to see the race. Sky Sports F1 commentator David Coulthard said that he hoped the cancellation might not happen, as a lot of fans had been expecting the event to take place in Australia. He said: ""I think you're going to see a lot of problems. I think it will be the same situation - don't be surprised if the race is cancelled, there's a lot of money in the sport, the money behind Formula One - and the people who live and work in the sport, they have to be excited. F1 has to move, and we'll see what happens. The GP in Melbourne has not been confirmed, but there is a possibility that it could take place in Australia. The decision was first announced on Thursday, and has been followed by an announcement to cancel the race on Friday. The race has been postponed, as has the Commonwealth Games.

Mr Kotynski said the camerawork remained on top of him for several minutes before he was able to get out and call for help.

1044,"Saviour of the dead: Burying the bodies India forgets how to do it, but it's easier than doing it properly Here, the Hindu temple of Shimla prepares the body of a deceased Hindu martyr. Shimla, a Hindu temple in north India, is the world's oldest ragas temple, built around 3,500 BC. It's not the first time a shrine has been torn down in India, but it's never been done properly. Our correspondent Pratiksha Ghildial reports from here. Filmed and edited by Ravi Nessman. Edited by Liza Dobbin. Music by Ashok Sarkar. Edited by Paul Casciato.

You can watch this footage on Shimla's Facebook page, or on BBC iPlayer. Click here to watch the full report from BBC Trending, or on the BBC News Channel on Sunday 28 December at 12: 05 GMT and 17: 20 GMT. You can also watch again five days after the report is available, on the BBC News Channel on Sunday 28 December at 00: 55 GMT and 13: 55 GMT, and on the BBC iPlayer. Shimla's first official visit to India was in 1992. It was a time when it was very much an ancient capital of India, and the country's history was marked by the building of temples and shrines. In 1992, the Indian government declared that the city of Shimla was a place of pilgrimage and religious relics, and so the city was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992. Since then, the city has become an eyesore, and has been placed under constant public scrutiny. At the very least, public access to the site is restricted, and the city's main street is blocked off to vehicles, so it is difficult to find a road through. But this is how Shimla's devotees make their holy journey: the process of burning the body is called saviour. The devotees are often seen to begin the process from the city's main square, before the shrine is finished. It's here that the deceased is laid to rest. It is also in the centre of the city."
1045,"Coronavirus: Six of President Trump's claims fact-checked Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Trump made the claim at his golf course Mar-a-Lago in Florida Six of President Trump's controversial claims that he was wiretapped during the 2016 election have been verified by a judge, the Washington Post reports. The US president said the claim had been made by the former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. But Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of Federal District Court in Washington, DC, said those claims were misleading. Mr Trump has repeatedly denied the claims. Last month Mr Trump's lawyers asked for the judge to declare ""no other evidence"" exists linking him to Mr Flynn's guilty plea. The judge said the allegations were ""irrelevant"" and ""without merit."" In a court filing on Thursday afternoon, Mr Trump's lawyers asked the judge to declare that no evidence existed to support the allegation. Mr Sullivan's ruling says that while the claims are important and ""cannot be used to advance any merit,"" two of them were ""unfounded and misleading"" and the other was ""demonstrably false."" Judge Sullivan asked both sides to submit statements by 13 June, ""beginning immediately."" The president's lawyers have asked Judge Sullivan to rule that the claims cannot be used as evidence. Mr Trump is a magnet for allegations of wrongdoing and could face severe legal consequences. The White House is yet to respond to the request. Mr Trump has said he was surprised by the judge's decision to quash the case against him, and has said he will ""come down hard"" on the judge. He told reporters he would ""absolutely"" prosecute Mr Flynn if there was a pardon. The judge has not issued a written opinion about the President's claims. In December, he said the president had not been a ""target"" for investigators and ""certainly not"" an unwitting victim of the Russian interference. The controversy has already forced the resignation of his national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Mr Flynn had been under intense pressure to resign because of his calls with the Russian ambassador. And in March, two of Mr Trump's former campaign aides were indicted on charges of making false statements to the FBI about their contact with Russia's ambassador in the weeks before the 2016 presidential election. President Trump has repeatedly denied that he was wiretapped during the campaign. But a special counsel has been appointed to investigate possible links between Mr Trump and Russian officials."
1046,"Are female urinals the answer to queues at the loos? Female urinals. Last year a leading charity called for a campaign to increase sex-selective education. In February, National Secular Society (NSS) chief executive Linda Thomas called on the government to introduce a public consultation regarding the issue. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Linda Thomas calls on the government to move towards sex-selective education ""The government has to have a public debate about sex and gender selective education,"" she said. Last year the government said it wanted sex-selective education to be taught in schools. But many people have expressed fears that children would not take part because of the lack of information being provided about such issues. ""We need to get more information about sex and gender, not just about it at secondary school,"" said Ms Thomas. She said that sex-selective education should be covered by a law ""to help teachers teach students the facts."" A Department for Education spokesman said gender and sexuality were ""complex issues"" and that the government had a ""clear and transparent position"" on gender selective education. ""Sex and gender selective education is about creating a positive environment which stimulates learning,"" he said. Schools and colleges should teach children how to adapt to their gender identity and be aware of their gender. We know that gender selection has a wide impact on children's lives, and that both boys and girls experience higher levels of gender identity and the prospect of having to be gender-specific. The government is absolutely committed to supporting gender diverse colleges and universities and ensuring that they continue to give high quality education to all students. There are currently more than 3,600 sex and gender inclusive colleges in the UK. A recent YouGov poll found that 62% of respondents would like to see a gender-specific range of gender-neutral colleges open. The NSS, the UK's only membership organisation for sex-selective education, also wants to see gender-neutral colleges offered in state schools. Sex selective education is on the government's radar in schools and college partnerships have been set up to provide more gender-specific education. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Sexual and gender-diverse colleges have been a particular focus of our strategy for sex education. We will look to see where this development can take us and work to help young people and parents to make informed choices and become more involved in the education of their children."
1047,"How Europe deals with terror offenders when they are freed from jail and given a licence. The Parole Board is responsible for setting parole rules, but it does not grant licences for those convicted of terrorist offences, or those who have already served their sentence. If you had been convicted of a terrorist offence, your sentence would have been shortened, but you would still have been considered for parole. This is because the Parole Board relies on a number of factors to decide whether someone should be released, including the risk that they will commit another crime or be re-released again. The board's decision is final, but it is inconsistent with the Human Rights Act, which allows judges to overturn decisions made by the Parole Board. This was the case when Adel Abdel Aziz was sentenced to life for his part in the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. Following his trial, the Attorney General (Lord Goldsmith) found that the police had acted lawfully by shooting the accused, when the shooting was believed to be an act of self-defence. He added that the shooting ""may have gone entirely unjustified,"" but had fallen ""well short of his personal view."" This led to the most revulsion in the West, and led to many politicians and human rights lawyers to demand that the decision be overturned. The legal advice of the government is that if the parole board were to reject a prisoner's application for release, it would be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects freedom of expression, and would, in effect, constitute a breach of Article 3 of the Privacy and Civil Liberties (Cantor) Convention, and constitute a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. A further complication arose when the European Court of Human Rights found that the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) was unlawful. The EAW was introduced in December 1999 and was intended to protect UK citizens' freedom of expression, but it has been criticised for being outdated. It was widely assumed that the Home Secretary, Theresa May, intended to introduce a new version of the EAW in the wake of the 9 / 11 attacks. Any attempt to change it has been strongly opposed by senior politicians. We are not surprised by the decision to change the law in this case. More than 130 men were convicted of terrorism"

General Tagme Na Waie told a UN-backed group of experts on cocaine that he had no option but to cut off the flow of narcotics. ""This is a very dangerous situation,"" he said. The cocaine trafficking network, which is alleged to be on the rise across the Americas, is thought to be controlled by drug traffickers in Guinea-Bissau, Congo, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic. ""There is a growing and growing demand from the cocaine traffickers for cocaine,"" said the head of the Guinea-Bissau National Army, General Joao Baptista, who earlier this month called in President Joao Bernardo Vieira to step down.

I have not been treated properly by the National Army (of the Guinea-Bissau), ""he said. The head of the UN Office of Drugs and Crime, Olivier De Schutter, said the organisation had received several reports in the past year of international drug traffickers in Guinea-Bissau controlling and selling cocaine to foreign countries and then trying to evade taxes. De Schutter said the situation was"" critical ""and that it was"" very difficult to predict how the cocaine trafficking network will evolve ""and the scale of the problem in Guinea-Bissau"" is becoming clear. """" The United States has been very supportive, ""he added. US Secretary of State John Kerry visited Guinea-Bissau last month and pledged more aid to help the fragile country, a former Portuguese colony."" The United States is committed to working with the government of Guinea-Bissau, and we remain interested for assistance that would help the country build a secure, prosperous, stable and transparent market, ""Kerry said in a statement. The US Treasury Department also announced new sanctions on six companies and two individuals linked with drug trafficking in Guinea-Bissau, which shares a border with Senegal.

1055,"Canadian PM Trudeau's wife tests positive for coronavirus 23 (UPI) -- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, said Wednesday she had tested positive for measles. The Liberals said Gregoire Trudeau's diagnosis came after the couple traveled to the United States for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. ""After speaking with the other ministers of the Commonwealth Heads of Government yesterday, I can confirm that I have been diagnosed with measles,"" Gregoire Trudeau said in a statement. I will continue to follow the advice of the medical community as I work to regain my strength and return to work as soon as possible. This is a very serious and serious illness. The prime minister's office said the disease is one of the most contagious communicable diseases, and the disease usually lives in the lungs or airways of young children. The disease is spread primarily by coughing, sneezing or touching contaminated objects. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it can infect 12 to 72 people in the United States each year. The disease kills almost all of those infected who catch it, although some remain hospitalized. The disease can cause fever, rash and a cough, which can be fatal. Measles isn't contagious in Canada. The virus is caught from people who travel to an infected area and then pass it on to others who are infected by close contact. Measles can cause serious illnesses, including pneumonia, encephalitis and convulsions. Mumps and rubella can be fatal, and a vaccine is available for children to prevent this infection. The virus is spread through direct contact with an infected person. On Wednesday, the prime minister tweeted about his return to Canada. ""My wife Sophie and I are feeling really good,"" he wrote. @ JustinTrudeau is currently in the United States and will be travelling to the USA to attend the CPAC. As always, I would like to thank everyone for their support and good wishes. Trudeau's office said they hope to resume regular communication with the family in the near future. In the meantime, he will remain in Ottawa to continue his recovery. The prime minister and his family were expected to return to Canada on Thursday.

1057,"The Muslim clerics preaching for Indonesiaâ <unk> <unk> s peat belt were at the centre of a mass protest in which police clashed with protesters demanding the removal of a third of Indonesia's forests. The demonstrations began after a man from the country's largest peat-farming company killed two passers-by outside his home. The man is reported to have called the police a ""snake"" and a ""tiger."" He then made other statements against Islam and killed the two peasants he had arrested. He remains in custody while an investigation is underway. Indonesia's National Commission for Aceh said the man's claim that he was Muslim constituted ""propaganda."" According to Indonesian president Joko Widodo, the man was actually a member of a local branch of the Islamic Defenders Front of Indonesia (FPI). The FPI claims to have thousands of members in Indonesia and has attacked local religious leaders, saying they are corrupt and have links to the Islamic State group. But the government has consistently dismissed the group as a terrorist organisation. The incident occurred just weeks after the execution of two Indonesian men convicted of the 2005 Bali bombings, which left 202 people dead. A third of Indonesia's peatlands are believed to contain unsustainable, potentially hazardous, degraded soil. According to the UN, there are nearly 30 million tonnes of peatland in Indonesia and Indonesia is responsible for almost 80 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Indonesian President Joko Widodo is on a fact-finding mission to Indonesia, which is the world's second largest peatland producer after the US. In a rare public appearance, Widodo spoke in the parliament in Jakarta on Wednesday, expressing his disbelief at the violent protests in Indonesia. Mr Joko has condemned the violence ""in the strongest terms,"" saying the government would not hesitate to use whatever force it felt to protect national security. And while the government condemns the violence, it also warns about the potential for ""inflammatory rhetoric."" ""This has real and damaging consequences for the development of society, and it will have a serious impact on our domestic position in the world,"" said a spokesman for the president, Jusuf Kalla. In our country, we all need to exercise our right to demonstrate peacefully. We will take very strong action if necessary."
1058,"Coronavirus: How to work from home, the right way to avoid contracting the infection for the rest of the UK The virus has now spread to the UK after a number of people contracted the illness in Wales. Despite the virus being widespread, there are other ways of contracting it. Anyone who has come into contact with someone who is suffering from the condition should be tested for the virus, and if necessary treated with antibiotics. According to the NHS, the majority of cases of coronavirus transmission are caused by travelling to countries where the symptoms develop. The NHS advises anyone who has travelled to countries affected by the virus to be tested for the virus, which is common in areas where the disease is prevalent. And if a person has had a close contact with someone who has the virus, they can also be offered the vaccine from the NHS. People who come into contact with someone who has the virus should be tested for the virus, and if the person has recovered, they should be offered the vaccine to protect themselves Dr Mary Ramsay, Public Health England's director of health protection, said: ""The risk of catching a coronavirus infection from someone who has had direct contact with someone who has the disease is extremely small - around one in 200 cases per year in the UK. However, you might have contracted the virus from a contact with someone who has had close contact with an infected person. We would encourage everyone who is concerned to report any symptoms within 48 hours of their passing from the virus to our hotline on 0800 179 8823. How do I get a coronavirus? The only way to get a coronavirus infection is to go to your GP. If you think you are suffering from the virus, you should take advice from your GP or contact NHS Direct. If you are not sure if you're affected by the disease, you can test for the virus at your GP surgery. If you are unsure, contact NHS Direct or call the Health Protection Agency (HPA) on 0800 026 2968. If you have symptoms of the illness, you may also be eligible to receive a free coronavirus vaccine, which lasts three months. A spokesman for the Department of Health said:"" While this is an unexpected situation, it does have serious implications for healthcare professionals.

1059,"Why is the Palace of Westminster falling apart? London was a world leader in architectural design and the building has been a symbol of the city's economic and cultural importance. It was first completed in a design by William Wilberforce in September 1801. It is now a great venue for cultural events, as well as for civil society, and still features the remains of a church that was destroyed during the Second World War. In 1902, the Queen and Queen travelled to London to mark the opening of the Victoria & Albert Museum on the site of the former Palace of Westminster. The Queen and Queen Mother toured the site and met the museum's director, Sir John Soane. The Queen and the Duke travelled to the West End of London to mark the opening of the V & A Museum of Design, which will open in 2017. The Queen was given a tour of the Museum of London's building in the Royal Albert Dock. Here, in pictures: The building dates to the 1820s, when the Palace of Westminster was built. The building was completed in 1831 and was then extended into a 19th Century royal residence. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the building in 1732 and Queen Elizabeth II in 1864. It was designed and built by Sir Thomas Heatherwick, and was built for the Queen Mother in February 1855. In 1892, it was bought by architect Sir Edwin Lutyens for just £1.6m. In 1905, the Tower of London was rebuilt by Thomas Heatherwick. In 1906, it was bought by Harry and Mary Turner for £6.5m. Later, the building was restored and reopened in 1830. In 1930, it was abandoned as a museum. The building was converted into a hotel. In 1957, the British Museum opened a museum dedicated to the history of London. It was designed and built by Henry Moore and in 1956, the Metropolitan Museum of Art opened a museum dedicated to the history of the world's biggest art collection. Its largest collection of 20th-century British art is housed at the museum, which has just gained the title of world's second largest privately-funded museum. It includes the work of Sir Thomas Heatherwick, who has been named the museum's new director, the first time a museum director has held the role. A complete list of the best museums in London is available here. More about: Art, London, United Kingdom, United Kingdom, United Kingdom"
1060,"The Plot Against Americaâ <unk> <unk> s vision feels eerily familiar right now, from the ""90s to the current political climate. This is a time when the media, which had a long track record of covering the political and economic debates of the day, is the best-funded source to report, and is the most effective source for the president's words and deeds. And yet, this is not a time when America's political system is in crisis. We've gotten so used to the idea that anything can happen in the name of the presidency, that it's hard to see why things are going to keep getting worse. The media, over and over again, has become the place when the president and his team are attempting to justify their actions in the context of the political system and the country. The media has, in the way of the public, become the place where even the best-informed leaders are supposed to hide behind a wall of silence. We have seen this for a while, and it's hard to tell what the consequences will be if the president departs behind a wall. But what's striking about this is that, with the president's re-election campaign under way, it's possible to still see the possibility of something worse, and that it's possible to imagine what it could be. The media, as the public is to foster the President's brand of politics, has become the place where only the best-informed leaders can hide behind a wall. The media, on the other hand, has expanded beyond its core role as the public's bulwark against the politics of the political systems. It's a place where the media has expanded beyond its core role as the public's bulwark against the politics of the political system. It's a place where the media has expanded beyond its core role as the public's guide to the political system. It's a place where an unelected president can actually be elected, and thus claim the mandate to change the political system, while also making it more difficult for the media to do its job. Even the most qualified newspaper editors in the country could be left exposed if the president remains unelected. But it's also been a place where the press has been able to consistently report on the power of the media, and we've seen this for a while now, and it's hard to tell what the consequences will be if the president departs behind a wall of silence. The media has become the place where the president and his team are"

I thought it would be an interesting way to show the differences in people of all ages. I don't want them to think I don't look amazing. I'm not the fat queen. I'm the body type.

1062,"How do you keep a space station clean? The astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) were able to have their space suits clean with a couple of simple simple moves - they placed a sheet over the surface of the water to protect the clothing. When the suit was cooled by the ISS's module, astronauts had to wear it for five days straight. The crew's helmet is made of synthetic fibres, and the space suit has three carbon composite panels on display. A video of the astronauts' laundry was released by the ISS this week, and it shows them cleaning the module and the cooling system before the suit is placed inside the protective suit. The ISS provides a great deal of moisture for astronauts to use in space. However, NASA explains that the crew may opt to wash their suits with a shower once the suits are released into the atmosphere. The astronauts are forced to wear gloves or wash their hands before they shower. This is because if the gloves are wet, the water is not enough to cover the fabric. However, the astronauts have their masks drawn and their clothes washed regularly. When they get wet the suits are very dirty, but the astronauts have their hands washed. They are also able to cool their suits by spritzing them with cold water. This solution is one of the most common household gadgets aboard the ISS. A shower can be used to warm up a space suit before being put into space. The shower can be used to wash a suit before being put into space. The shower can be used to cool a space suit before being put into space. ""All of this is done from the comfort of orbit,"" NASA explains. It is not just about being able to use a shower. A shower can be used to cool a space suit before being put into space. This is the only way to remove oil. It is also effective when the suit is in use. Not only do the astronauts know how to use the shower, but they also know how to use it. The crew is also able to use the shower to clean the suits before it is placed in the protective suit. ""It's kind of like a glove,"" astronaut Sunita Williams said when NASA released this video. It doesn't have to be in a tight spot to be effective. It's sort of like a big bag of rubbish."
1063,"The city where you pay a year's rent up front, and the one you're saving for it When renting a home in the city, what you'll pay depends on your household income. The average UK household earns around £30,000 per year, so that could pay for an investment of £18,000 in rent for a year. However, the average UK household in the UK today is only around £35,000. The survey, from property website Zoopla, calculates that to buy a home in the UK, you'll have to save £18,500 a year. This means you'll need to save your cash around a quarter or £100,000 to buy a second home. The same amount would be needed to spend on rent, plus the cost of purchasing a new flat. So how much money would you save? Zoopla research has shown it would take you to an average UK salary of £18,500 a year, an amount which will drop to £17,000 in the coming years. If you're saving for a deposit, you'll need to save up to £4,500, while spending on rent would be around £3,600. If you're renting a property for yourself or your family, you could save an average of £3,600 a year. The same amount would be needed to buy a second property, plus the cost of buying a new flat.
