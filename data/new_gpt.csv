887,"opinion | broadway is closed. write poems instead. chapter 1 - the last stand of a new york city opera singer and her husband, who was also in his late fifties, had been murdered by an assassin. he died on december 13, 1943, with no apparent cause or motive, but that did not stop reporters from calling to see if they could get more details about what happened. they were disappointed when their story turned out to be nothing like it should have been. there are many reasons why this might happen : first, because someone wanted him dead ; second, because some people believed that he wouldn't die without being asked questions. third, because most police officers don't want to take chances. fourth, because a lot of investigators think that these murders may have something to do with the deaths of two young men whose lives depended upon each other for survival. i've read all three articles and found them fascinating as well as disturbing. this one has me intrigued enough to decide to try my hand at writing a novel based around the fact that the murder occurred during a time before the world war ii era. i'm sure you 'll agree that the author's name was john smith, which means "" the great man "" and, therefore, was probably named after him. however, since the writer never wrote anything short of a book ( except perhaps the title ), we can assume that he was the greatest composer ever written. he loved music so much that he created songs and plays such complex melodies that made even the best musicians feel special. that particular song came up several times over the years, especially when the critics called it "" i can't wait until you're finished! "" the publisher of the series was an old friend of mine, george h. w. bush, whom i met while working as a freelance editor at a small publishing house near atlanta. after reading the manuscript, i decided that it was worth pursuing and was very excited about finding out whether it really meant anything to anyone else besides myself. i thought maybe there 'd come a point where the reader would realize how important this work truly is to the readers of this collection. maybe then the authors themselves would understand just exactly what kind of person they are dealing with, or the effect of the stories they will create.",gpt

"" and he 'd tell everyone how much fun it used to be growing up here. it made sense now why dad left all those old houses behind when he retired. matt's house still has some memories of being a teenager living here. it seems like forever ago. my favorite memory is sitting by myself watching tv with my best friend, michael, while she reads to me on the couch. she always makes sure that i know exactly what i am reading because we're friends. i love hearing stories about my little brothers and sisters. i remember my younger siblings getting older, just as matt does every day. i think they've grown since then too, though it feels more like ten years. i'm almost six months pregnant again today. my heart skips several beats at the thought of having another child. i feel excited about the possibility of raising four kids someday. i hope my baby will",gpt
