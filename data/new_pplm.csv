(photo: nasa) the tallest species of plants on earth — a group called apis mellifera, named for its long-necked, upright trunk — has long been a target of conservation efforts, but scientists are not entirely clear about the genetic means by which the group's species is protected from extinction due to climate change. now, researchers in a new paper published online in the journal scientific reports describe their findings, which could be used to help shape conservation policies, such as those currently in place for many species of plants and animals. apes' high rate of species extinctions is well-known. they have been wiped out by climate change and other impacts since their emergence about 100 million years ago. they are among a group of plants and animals that has already faced extinction due to habitat loss, climate change and other changes in nature. apes' species diversity is highly variable, the researchers said. the researchers used genetic methods to predict species species richness and predicted that the species with the highest rate of species extinctions would have the highest rate of genetic diversity — meaning a higher level of genetic diversity would be necessary to protect the species in a given area of the world. [10 most common species on earth: images] the results of the study, which were published in the journal science, indicate the potential benefits to the species could be enormous: ""if species extinctions become rare enough to be considered a threat, they could have a significant effect on biodiversity, which would help reduce the risk of species extinctions from future human-induced climate change and habitat loss due to natural resource destruction or habitat degradation,"" the study says.

89,"| | why india's citizenship law crosses the line by shobhan srivastava and arvind panchayya on may 18, 2013 the law on citizenship and the status of immigrants has a very strange twist. under the law, citizenship is conferred on people who have been resident in the country for less than three years. this is not true. a person is entitled to citizenship if he/she was a citizen before he entered india. the law is not clear on whether a person was born or adopted, or if he was born in india. the law, however, is clear that the person has to have entered india before 3 years after his or her birth. it was a law that was passed in 2005, but the law has never been implemented because of opposition from the centre. nowadays, many indians don't know if they can get citizenship, or not. the indian constitution guarantees citizenship to the citizen from all over the country. the constitution states that ""every citizen of the state shall be entitled to the same rights, immunities and benefits as any other citizen"". the citizenship law states that the indian government has to take steps to check people who don't know the rules in the constitution for the purpose of applying to get citizenship. the laws and the regulations are in a state of uncertainty and many indians don't know what is legal, what is illegal etc. the problem of people who don't know the law, what to do when the law has gone wrong or how to apply it. there may be a few people who are aware of the law in the country but are not aware that they are not entitled to apply to get citizenship. this law is very confusing since many people don't know how to apply to have citizenship. some people who are aware that they should not apply to be a citizen have applied to have the citizenship as they have a legal right to citizenship. but it does not mean to have all the rights and benefits as citizens. it means only the right to become a citizen. the problem is that there is a very small number of people who are aware of the law and don't apply it. they apply for the right to be a citizen, but it does not mean to be a citizen. it is possible to become a citizen, but only by acquiring certain papers or a government registration card. what should be done by state governments for the welfare and welfare of the population? the government must be given",pplm

'tattooed' but in victorian society there was also an emphasis on individuality and individuality became more important in society than appearance. the first tattoo in the uk was done under anaesthetic, dr smith says, and there was a growing desire for more individuality to be felt in society. ""a lot of people were saying, 'this is the era of individuality, let's go out and get our own individuality,"" he says. the first tattoo that we think was a public show of public opinion was the painting of a man's face, in the style of the victorian painter. it was done to promote a cause which was very important to the public, and it's the same in the tattooing world today, to say 'i'm different from everyone'. dr smith explains that the word ""tattoo"" has been used to describe anything in public which has been made into art. in the 19th century a woman was allowed to wear whatever she liked, and there was a strong state interest in individuality the royal society for culture, politics and the state but the state's interests were far more important for the artist than the state's interests were for the public. in the victorian era the government sought state support to produce new art forms and the arts and culture sector was state-run, so that there was a state interest in the creation of art, dr smith says. ""i think the art state in general, was the state in the 19 state governments that we've got government and that's been political in politics for political purposes, and so we have a state interest and the state interest has been political. and there were a lot of state governments who supported the artists",pplm

""we have been using ai for quite a bit,"" explained john martin, co-founder of blue origin who was one of the original inventors of 3d printing technology that is now a standard in most manufacturing and manufacturing applications. ""a few years ago, we didn't know that we would be able to build a robot capable of doing that. but in the last few years, we have been building a lot more of that."" martin explained that 3d printing and robotics were developed at a time when people were looking for ways to increase the efficiency and cost of manufacturing and manufacturing in particular had come up with an idea to use drones to carry out tasks like assembling components and cutting them. in this way, a robot could cut out parts in order to reduce manufacturing time – and the cost.

197,"| | the economy stinks, but i'm doing ok, say working class whites by robert reich and others it has been reported in many places that white working class voters have become more likely to support bernie sanders, but it's worth looking a bit deeper in terms of the political geography of america. there's no doubt that sanders has won a number of states that are traditionally democratic, and there is some data suggesting that these states are in fact more white than democratic. however, it's important to look at the geographic pattern, and this analysis finds a much more complicated picture: the map above, which is a combination of state-level election results (the democratic map is based on the 2008 election, the republican map is a mix of 2012 and 2016 results) and the 2016 presidential map of the respective states (the map below is based upon 2016 electoral votes), shows the racial breakdown in the electorate, with a significant black share of white voters compared with the rest of the white population. it's not quite as obvious as you might think, because states have shifted from the state-to-state voting system that has historically been dominated by whites. there are a number of states with a substantial black share of population in which white voters have become more democratic over the last two decades, but there's no question that the states with a large black population are states where bernie sanders is currently winning. there is no doubt that this is a problem. the black share of the electorate, in states that are overwhelmingly black, can swing state legislative races in favor of the state democratic party candidates. the state-level political geography of state politics is a major factor in how state legislators vote, and state legislative maps are often state-based maps; state state legislators will typically choose their state state party candidates from their state's state legislature district. this can result in black legislators in blue states, or even red states, being more progressive than state state state legislators in states where the state party candidate is from a state other than their state. state legislators have state legislatures where the state party candidate is state party-represented, which means state lawmakers in those state legislative districts are more likely to state state party state legislative candidates, state legislators in states where there is a state state congressional district, state state legislature state house state state state senate state house state senate state legislature state state state state senate state senate state legislature state state state house state state state state senate state state house state senate state senate state senate state senate state state state state state house state state state",pplm

""the cdc is concerned that a change in parents' approach to protecting their children may have contributed to an increase of cases of the coronavirus, which can cause severe illness,"" said dr. william schaffner, the cdc's assistant director of public health. the cdc's move comes after the world health organization warned that the epidemic is spreading rapidly among developing nations. the cdc report said coronavirus, which is caused by coronaviral herpes virus, causes severe illness. the cdc said the virus has no known cure. the centers for disease control and prevention has said it is taking a series of measures to curb the outbreak. those efforts include increasing state and national efforts at preventing the spread of the virus; making sure states and communities understand the importance of vaccinating against it; and developing and testing ways to help people who don't want their kids vaccinated. the cdc is asking the states where the outbreak is spreading to take all necessary steps to stop vaccinating and vaccinate all children, no matter age. state officials who choose not to do those actions face penalties, such as fines, according to the cdc. if a state does not implement a state law allowing it to stop vaccinating, state officials could be fined up to $10,000. state officials who fail to provide information about the risks of immunizations could face up to $1,000 or five years in state jail. ""we are asking states to follow the cdc's lead, and we are asking states to ensure their children get vaccinations against the most serious form of vaccine-preventable disease,"" schaffner said. the report from the who is the second time the u.s. government has ordered state to stop allowing parents to get immunization shots. a year ago, the u.s. department of health and human services banned states from allowing the public to receive any state-issued vaccines to protect children against whooping cough from 2009 until the end of the current fiscal year, according",pplm

""they wanted me to be a professional. i'm not a professional at all, so i can't be a professional union member,"" said masato yoshida, 43. yoshida, who is also a professor at the university of tokyo's graduate school of business, said the union didn't want to take on a new worker who didn't speak japanese fluently.

""we believe in fair competition, and the fcc's decision will not address these issues. we look forward to reopening as soon as possible as a result of this vote, which is consistent with our long-standing commitment to our customers and the community we serve."" wrote a company spokeswoman, in an emailed statement to nbc . a dunkin spokeswoman told the washington post that the decision was not based on the company's ""long-standing commitment"" to washington. a spokesman for the fcc told nbc that it does consider the issue of how fast food companies treat their customers and customers' privacy. the fcc also considers the privacy of the public, he added, and the fcc will review the case in the coming weeks. but the company, which has more than 5,700 restaurants in more states than it can count, has already decided to shut down by dec. 11, the first day of the new year.

""in fact, the law doesn't mention the requirement at all. it does say the state must provide coverage of vaccines as specified under the act. it does not say that the state must cover all vaccines. that could mean states have two options, one of which could be to make coverage mandatory but not all vaccines, or another of which would require coverage of a certain class of vaccines but not cover others."" states that have no requirements on vaccination coverage, thomas said, could still opt to make a decision on which coverage is best for their individual insurance customers. states that did require coverage, he said, could still be affected by the new rules, and the cdc would provide a guidance document for states in the future about when coverage should take effect, and how it would be determined to ensure that insurance coverage covers all vaccinations. | | if there is one thing i've learned during the past",pplm

""we wanted to determine whether a baby-sitter's knowledge of baby odour and their ability to detect it would have any implications for the ability of their baby to be identified and cared for by the parent who was the parent for the first time,"" he said. dr kowalczyk said she had always wondered what the babies might smell like, and the research was one part of the answer.

461,"| | 4 of your latest coronavirus questions, answered what are some ways to avoid becoming infected by an influenza-like virus in your home? if you have a family physician and a lab technician to examine a child or adolescent for influenza, you are advised to avoid all types of household contact with children and adolescents (excepting those with fever and/or cough) and contact a family member if the child is not in the home. this recommendation is consistent with current guidelines for the care of children at the time of influenza vaccination for the united states department of health and human services and the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention. this guidance provides recommendations for how to prevent influenza among children, adolescents, and their parents. the recommendation in this document is based on the following considerations: 1) the likelihood of influenza transmission among household contacts is low, 2) influenza is generally a milder illness that is less contagious than pneumonia or influenza, 3) influenza is often milder in adults than in children and adolescents, and 4) influenza vaccination is the only effective way to prevent influenza. the recommendations also take account of factors that influence the risk of transmission: 1) influenza season and seasonality; 2) the presence of a laboratory culture, 3) the age of the child or adolescent, and 4) the level of influenza vaccine coverage (including age-appropriate doses and timing) by the vaccine supplier. in general, the recommended vaccination coverage for children, adolescents and their parents should be: • 90 percent (95 percent confidence interval [ci]). • 60 percent (95 percent ci). • 35 percent (95 percent ci) for adults. • 20 percent (95 percent ci) for children aged less than 12 years. for children, the recommended vaccination coverage for adults should be: • 90 percent (95 percent ci). • 60 percent (95 percent ci). • 50 percent (95 percent ci) for adults. • 30 percent [ci] for children aged 12–17 years (and 30 percent [ci] for all others). this advice is based on the following considerations: 1) the likelihood of influenza transmission by household contact is low, 2) influenza is generally a milder illness that is not contagious and does not cause death, 3) influenza is generally milder in adults than in children and adolescents, and 4) influenza vaccination coverage is relatively stable throughout a season. for adults, the",pplm

(reuters) when a cuban hospital worker discovered a virus that killed over 2,000 people earlier this year, she took matters in a different direction. instead of using a latex mask that was likely to spread the infection to other patients, she made one that would keep the virus out of the patient, and in doing so she was able to stop the spread of infection. she named it the ""caviar-mask"" to reflect its simplicity and the fact that it could not spread through the air. [a deadly outbreak of a deadly virus has begun in cuba] the mask has made her a viral advocate and, for the most part, is not being used to spread disease. but she's making it because she wants others around the country to know that it's possible to make masks, and the cuban government is trying to encourage others who want to try it. on monday, her hospital made the masks for the first time — and she was the one who was responsible for getting the materials from abroad. cuban officials wanted to send the mask to the united states, where it would be tested for its effectiveness, but there was just too much risk, said the hospital's president, maria l. lázaro. she had been planning for it. lázaro, who spoke in her office in an old building on the main square of the country's capital, havana, with the masks on display in front of her, was wearing them monday morning, and it was a rare chance to see them. in recent years, she said, the health ministry has been working with the u.s. food and drug administration — now part of the government — to help make the masks that protect against avian influenza (which kills up to 100,000 people per year) and the zika virus that has been linked to thousands in the united states and brazil.

( photos: 10 things trump has said on foreign visits) the official said it was unclear if trump's aides planned to ask for a formal response to the withdrawal, but that the president would be ""taking a very strong stance on japan."" the official insisted that the withdrawal would come as a complete surprise to the japanese government.

""the message i'm running is: we need a government that represents all of us,"" said sanders. and the sanders campaign wants voters to know that he's the only candidate who is running on a program for a $15 an hour minimum wage. he wants to raise taxes on the wealthiest americans while increasing the federal debt limit. the message is that it's a program that will actually get more done and it's not the only one out there on the ballot in november 2016. but for the sanders campaign, it is the first step in getting the message across that if he wins the white house, it will be the first step in changing the system in the united states. that means the state party's campaign has been working closely with the sanders campaign fund, a super pac that supports independent and democratic presidential candidates in 2016.

758,"| | an incredibly fast 'dark matter hurricane' is blowing past earth right now an incredibly fast storm of particles that has traveled so fast, we're almost unable to measure them with our eyes. scientists from the university of texas say a ""dark matter"" hurricane is now in orbit around earth, but it's not quite what it appears to be. the researchers, led by dr. richard b. baez, used a new way to measure the speed at which electrons travel through a material, the superconductivity, a state when electrons cannot be moved by magnetic fields. ""we can do this with a lot less energy, but we also need to take into account the superconductivity of the material,"" said dr. baez. ""in other words, it's not only an electric circuit, but there's also a magnetic flux going around this material. in other words, it's a kind of magnetic field in the material."" in a nutshell, the superconductivity of a material allows electrons to flow through it, which allows them to form a very strong and stable connection with a magnetic field. the scientists then measured the speed with which they could see electrons moving through the material. the researchers then compared this to how fast a superconductor can move under the effects of a certain type of field, or magnetic field. the scientists found the material was moving at a speed of approximately 100 million times the speed of light. ""we were very happy,"" said dr. baez. ""we've seen this superconductivity of electrons move faster than the speed of light, but we never thought it was going to be this fast."" the researchers say it's still not clear if these ultrafast speeds could have originated directly from superconductors or if it was a result of something else. for example, the scientists say, it is possible that the superconductor could have been a direct result of experiments on how to manipulate superconducting material. the university of texas also recently conducted experiments to look at the superconductivity of materials, which found it was a state of matter in which the superconductor is a state of matter, which allows for very rapid transfer of power. the team says the research is a very important step toward understanding how the universe works and how it is controlled from the atomic level up to the subatomic level. follow thomas on twitter at twitter.com/tcpower | | ""i don't think we've had an",pplm

(photo from nfl network) austin is a freak athlete — he's the only player in history to win the nfl's player of the year award — but the vikings need more power to take over a game like they did in 2017. austin led the nfl in quarterback pressures with 15.0. 3. the fifth round (no. 37 overall, washington) the seahawks' sixth-round pick, defensive end roy williams, has been very impressive. williams was an absolute force against power running backs last season, and he was a dominant force in coverage. his five sacks were the most of any defensive player. 4. the sixth round (no. 62 overall, buffalo) the bills got a great safety in stephon gilmore, and the bills also got a solid corner in ronald darby. gilmore is going to make his first start at safety. the bills have had great depth at cornerback, including byron maxwell, who was a big reason buffalo's defense",pplm

""it is really the most significant generational gap ever measured,"" said pew research center political scientist andrew koh. ""there have been significant differences in the number of mobile phones that we have in the united states."" the generational gap reflects the generational gap between the children in the united states and children from other countries that were born when the internet was in its infancy, said john b. smith, a professor and research director for government, public policy and economic affairs at rutgers university-new brunswick. the data shows americans from all political parties are more likely than any other generation to be on mobile technology, smith said. the generational gap also reflects generational differences in attitudes toward smartphones. ""it is more common for young people to use smartphones to talk and text than the older generation,"" said david green, a political scientist at university of wisconsin-madison who co-authored a 2010 study on american political attitudes and attitudes about technology. ""young people tend to favor more government regulations, which could be an important factor in this generation. it is also true that young people tend to be the most liberal of all age groups when it comes to voting politics, and this could be due to a generational political divide."" a political party's political leanings is a political party's political leanings, which means the party base is a group of people who hold a political party political views, or a group who vote based on politics. the party's political leanings are defined by party politics, and political parties are not political organizations that have political candidates running for election. political parties also are not political parties that run elections, but",pplm

""the average boomer today is more likely to be a retiree, have fewer assets, and have an income that is lower than it was in the early years of the baby boomer boom,"" says the report. and the median annual household income, the income at which a family earns enough to buy its standard of living, declined between 1999-2010. it goes on to",pplm

""i think that when i was young i thought there was a lot of generational tension,"" clinton says in the new book, a people's history, which was published tuesday. ""you know, you had these really great, powerful people who, you know, were in power. but it was just really hard to imagine that these people had these kind of generational expectations about where they were going to end up in life, that it would be a great generation or something else."" clinton says that's changed. ""it's really hard to believe that people who grew up in a time of great political opportunity, like my generation, could have imagined that there would be so much economic inequality, there would be so much racial inequality. it was just not true,"" he says. but it's still true, he says. ""and that's why there's a generation gap and it is not a generational divide and it is not a political divide and it is not a class gap,"" he says. clinton cites his son's election as proof of the generational divide — that the president-elect of the united states is an outlier among the president and vice presidents, and not an outlier among the other first ladies and senators. (his dad won the presidency in 1980.) ""i think it would be easy to point out that my father won the popular vote, but it's not the case that all of the first ladies and senators and presidents and governors are out-and-out winners,"" he explains. ""that seems pretty far-fetched to me."" clinton also suggests that we're in a ""great generation,"" and that's one of the reasons we should be worried about the gap between young and old. ""i think the idea that the great majority of americans have been in power for too long and that we haven't gotten much done is, to me, a very dangerous notion,"" he says.

863,"| | how to clean your phone to help protect against coronavirus by john rippe | january 14, 2014 | if you've been getting sick from your phone, and you haven't had it cleaned to remove the microorganisms present, chances are it is contaminated with viruses. in fact, the viruses are the cause of many of the health problems we have today. coronaviruses, like the human version, are the cause of about 70 million diseases and conditions, and they are responsible for a lot of death from the human race. they're also responsible for about one-third of the deaths among children, but they're still not fully understood. in order to find out what these viruses and other microorganisms are, we need to know their dna or genetic code so we can figure out how and why certain viruses infect certain parts of the body. and that dna, or ""information,"" is what allows them to replicate and grow into new forms. in the past 20 years, scientists have made some progress at finding these genetic information, but the problem is that the dna that these scientists rely on comes from bacteria. the problem is, bacteria have an incredibly complex genetic code and the dna from that genetic code is very, very different from that of humans. in order to get the dna from humans and bacteria to have the same dna as a plant, they needed to have a different dna. and the problem is, the bacteria in the gut, the colonized areas of people's bodies where we get food for digestion, are very, very different from the bacteria in the human stomach or the colon and intestines, which are our body's natural home. so it's really important when dealing with bacteria to get them to have the very same dna from their natural home that makes them susceptible to viruses. the problem with the traditional way you get these dna is that it has not been tested in humans and it is not known if it has the correct genetic code for viruses or not. in order to do dna testing in humans, we have to be able to look at the dna of a person that we would be interested in. and if we have a person that was sick, we can look at the dna to see how well we are treating them and how well we are treating the viruses that might be in the dna. this dna testing is called polymerase chain reaction, also referred to the cr test, which means ""coding",pplm

""if people are worried about how they're going to spend their retirement, the best course of action i can think of for them is to not make any of these contributions, but rather to have their retirement accounts frozen at least until they're 50,"" says michael b. green of the american council on retirement. the survey, which was conducted by the nonpartisan institute for policy studies and was sponsored by the vanguard group, also found that most americans don't have a good answer to the question of whether 401(k) retirement savings should be made mandatory. according to the survey, just over half — 54 percent — of the people who responded said they were opposed to mandatory retirement savings for americans. another 22 percent were in favor of the proposal. and even though people are mostly opposed to mandatory 401(k) contributions, they're not opposed to some of the tax and other benefits people would receive if those contributions are made mandatory. the report states, ""many people don't think that the tax benefits from the tax law and the retirement law are sufficient to pay for mandatory retirement savings contributions."" the report notes that mandatory retirement contributions are a tax-advantaged investment. it also notes that the tax benefits from mandatory contributions are higher than they are from other tax-advantaged investments, including stocks — where you pay less tax than if you made a regular investment — and bonds, where there are lower tax deductions.

886,"| | opinion | let's move courts online and suspend bail for nonviolent offenses by james w. bunch washington post staff writer tuesday, june 16, 2001; page a1 the courts are a mess. in recent years, judges who have presided over more than 500,000 cases have been suspended for contempt of court for refusing to hand over the names of their lawyers and for not complying in the most egregious of cases. the most recent case was that of the supreme court justice john paul stevens, who was suspended in june for contempt for refusing to turn over his lawyers. in other words, the system is broken, and no one, including justice stevens, has stepped forward to fix it. but it is a problem that must be addressed. in the united states, there's a general consensus that if judges can't keep their oaths they ought not serve as judges. the supreme court has made clear, however, that it is not bound by law or court order or even by the constitution's requirement of judicial impartiality. justice stevens, the last supreme court justice to be charged with a felony, had a criminal history that included burglary in 1994. his lawyer, michael d. ruchick, said he did not think any of this made it difficult for the justice to serve. ""he's been very candid in his answers, and i'm sure he'll explain it to you,"" ruchick said. stevens did not appear to be in a position to defend his actions. ""i'm the only lawyer in the court room,"" stevens told ruchick. ""so if somebody comes to me, i can say to them, 'i'm sorry, you're under criminal court orders.' "" the court also said in a ruling last week that stevens did violate rules for judicial conduct. but it said that the rules were intended to prevent the appearance of bias because the justices are not bound to follow court orders. ""there's no law in the united states constitution that says i'm supposed to be impartial,"" said justice stevens, whose contempt charges against stevens came in a civil court case involving the use of a computer system in the state of washington. ""the law is that i can't have any influence. but there's no obligation on the part of the court to be impartial. and in the case of a judicial officer, the obligation is that he or she will exercise that impartiality."" but, the justice added, he was willing to take that oath if it meant that others might follow, ""but i've always refused. it",pplm

890,"| | opinion | they've contained the coronavirus. here's how. when it comes to the ebola outbreak in west africa, a common theme among scientists and health officials is that the virus is highly contagious. but that hasn't been true since the outbreak in west germany began in 1976, when the virus was discovered in a patient who tested positive for the virus. that's a problem, because the centers for disease control and prevention is now trying to isolate the ebola strain and then try to find out if there is a risk for transmission from a person who has recently traveled to west africa. this is a key step in a process that will determine how quickly and effectively the disease is contained. but if we are to have the best chance of containing this crisis, we must first understand exactly what ebola is. it's also crucial for understanding why this crisis is happening and how to avoid a similar one in the future. why ebola is a threat to u.s. health it has been estimated that as many as half of americans will be ill or have died from ebola, according to an article published by reuters. that's a serious problem. according to the cdc, more than 10,000 americans have traveled abroad to become ill with the disease. this is a problem because, in the event of an outbreak that could have far-reaching consequences, there is little federal government or state government control. in the case of a u.s. ebola case, it might take months or years for authorities to get hold of anyone who is believed to have been exposed to the virus. and, as in any outbreak, we don't know who is at the top or bottom of the chain of transmission — that's the big unknown. ebola could have many people living under false identities, according to a report in the washington post. this could have a huge impact on health care workers, especially those at the state or local level. and it could affect government and law enforcement officials. it could be difficult to determine if state or local government is doing what it is supposed to be doing, says the washington state department of health.

""there have been some very significant reports of adverse events associated with thimerosal,"" said dr. andrew wakefield, director of the center for vaccine safety at the institute for medical research in london. wakefield is the one who originally found the connection and, as npr's tamara keith reports from london, has called attention to the issue. wakefield's study, published last year in the journal of the american medical association, found that thimerosal exposure may increase the risk of developmental disabilities in young children. and it was also the first to link thimerosal use with autism — a conclusion that the american medical association now says is ""without scientific foundation."" a study published in 2012 in bmj also found thimerosal was linked to developmental disabilities in young infants who were then exposed to the mmr vaccine, although the researchers didn't find a significant effect on their cognitive development. wakefield says that, while these earlier studies suggest thimerosal may be linked to some autism-related problems, the new data suggests it may be harmless.

""this is my last opportunity to get it."" the decision to freeze salary cap information was made by the n.b.a. after its owners approved new labor agreements that would raise the collective bargaining salary floor from $2.6 million in 2013 to the $2.7 million level by 2017 (which would be paid out in the form of an increase in player salaries). the players, as well as their unions, have said that the league's proposal to raise their salaries is unreasonable and unfair. the players and their union have filed a grievance with the u.s. supreme court in new york seeking to have the n.b.a. pay their union's legal fees, and the union has filed its appeal of the decision to the supreme court in a bid for a stay to allow the n.b.a. to make the salary-cap freeze. nba commissioner david stern has been battling the n.b.a. for years to have salary cap information made public. (michael s. williamson/the state/ap) the players' union argued that the n.b.a. could not have paid any of that $2.7 million because the union did not negotiate a collective-bargaining agreement with the n.b.a. ""we believe the court's ruling should be a clear signal to the n.b.a., nba players and the general public that there are other avenues to resolve this dispute,"" the players' union said in a statement. ""the n.b.a.'s decision to unilaterally freeze the n.b.a. salary and benefits in the interest of the collective bargaining agreement, rather than for the common good, undermines the integrity of our collective-bargaining process, and undermines public confidence in our democratic process."" nba commissioner and president of the union michael jordan, right",pplm

""he's been very candid in his answers, and i'm sure he'll explain it to you,"" ruchick said. stevens did not appear to be in a position to defend his actions. ""i'm the only lawyer in the court room,"" stevens told ruchick. ""so if somebody comes to me, i can say to them, 'i'm sorry, you're under criminal court orders.' "" the court also said in a ruling last week that stevens did violate rules for judicial conduct. but it said that the rules were intended to prevent the appearance of bias because the justices are not bound to follow court orders.

""i am a constitutional conservative and that means i don't believe in changing a constitution, changing legislation, making it up as i go along.

1010,"| | are female urinals the answer to queues at the loos? updated female urinals have long been an integral part of australian culture but the answer is still up in the air. are they a solution to the queues, a necessity or an annoyance? female urinals are not as widely used as male urinals but their use is increasing and has been increasing since the early 1960s. a review of the history of urinal technology suggests that male urinals have been a more efficient and convenient way to use urinals since the mid-1960s. a review of a range of different female urinals, including those made from plastic or rubber, found that they could be used to flush up to two times as much material in one trip as a standard male toilet. the male toilet can produce up to 50 litres (about three litre) of urine per flush, while a female can produce up to 40 litres per flush, depending on the type of toilet. male urinals also had a much lower maintenance cost compared to the use of a female urinal, while women had to wash their clothes and underwear after use. but a female urinal can only hold one cup of liquid at a time so a woman is likely to have to use more sanitary products to flush. female urinals also tend to be made from plastic or metal so the plastic tends to get stuck to the urinal and can be difficult to clean. a female urinal can usually be cleaned after use but some women have complained about mould growing on the inside of the urinal and the metal on the urinal can get bent if a woman uses it for an extended period. but there is another issue — female urinals are not easy to clean. if your female urinal gets dirty or mouldy then you are more likely to end up with a mouldy female urinal. female urinals are often used in a public toilet to flush up to six cups of liquid each minute, but this can be problematic if a lady is using it for more than a day at a time. in a study by the australian national university researchers from the centre for health, environment and technology said the average person using a female urinal is expected to use a toilet for between 30 and 50 minutes each day — which means they are using up to two to three cups per day. the australian national university researchers suggest a woman could be expected to flush a male",pplm

1046,"| | are female urinals the answer to queues at the loos? updated female urinals have long been an integral part of australian culture but the answer is still up in the air. are they a solution to the queues, a necessity or an annoyance? female urinals are not as widely used as male urinals but their use is increasing and has been increasing since the early 1960s. a review of the history of urinal technology suggests that male urinals have been a more efficient and convenient way to use urinals since the mid-1960s. a review of a range of different female urinals, including those made from plastic or rubber, found that they could be used to flush up to two times as much material in one trip as a standard male toilet. the male toilet can produce up to 50 litres (about three litre) of urine per flush, while a female can produce up to 40 litres per flush, depending on the type of toilet. male urinals also had a much lower maintenance cost compared to the use of a female urinal, while women had to wash their clothes and underwear after use. but a female urinal can only hold one cup of liquid at a time so a woman is likely to have to use more sanitary products to flush. female urinals also tend to be made from plastic or metal so the plastic tends to get stuck to the urinal and can be difficult to clean. a female urinal can usually be cleaned after use but some women have complained about mould growing on the inside of the urinal and the metal on the urinal can get bent if a woman uses it for an extended period. but there is another issue — female urinals are not easy to clean. if your female urinal gets dirty or mouldy then you are more likely to end up with a mouldy female urinal. female urinals are often used in a public toilet to flush up to six cups of liquid each minute, but this can be problematic if a lady is using it for more than a day at a time. in a study by the australian national university researchers from the centre for health, environment and technology said the average person using a female urinal is expected to use a toilet for between 30 and 50 minutes each day — which means they are using up to two to three cups per day. the australian national university researchers suggest a woman could be expected to flush a male",pplm

1059,"| | why is the palace of westminster falling apart? there are many reasons to wonder why the palace of westminster, home to britain's house of lords and the house of commons, might be in such disrepair and the public funding cuts that may be taking a toll. the most obvious is that the palace's size has declined significantly, as the building was built in an era of austerity, and the palace of westminster is the only government building in london whose size hasn't changed. the other big factor is that, in the wake of its own financial crisis in 2007-08, the british government's spending cut, called an 'austerity budget', led to cuts in public spending in the uk. the government had already spent a large amount of money in public services in the years following its financial crisis but it cut public spending even further after 2007. so while the uk's population had grown and population-wide public spending had increased, public spending cuts meant that the government had to cut public spending in the uk as well. this led to a reduction in public expenditure in the rest of the uk, which in turn led to a contraction in population. as a result, the population has been contracting and the population has grown. in the uk the population grew from 1.1 billion to 1.1 billion people in the last decade, a population contraction of around 7%. the average population has grown from 1.1 billion people to 1.1 billion in the last decade, a population expansion of around 2%. there is a reason why we call these numbers population contraction and population expansion; population contraction and population growth are the same thing. the population of the uk is declining and population growth in the uk is increasing. it is the same trend that has been observed since 1970 when the population of the uk fell by over a third to around 1.2 billion people in 1970, while the population of the uk grew by about the same amount to 1.4 billion people (in 1980 the growth rate was 1.5% per annum). so it should surprise nobody that the uk's population will continue to shrink. it has already decreased in the years since the financial crisis, and it is likely to continue to do so until the population stabilises. the uk government is spending an estimated £1.1 billion each year on the upkeep of its buildings, and that figure is projected to rise in the years ahead. the government's funding cuts are expected to reduce its operating costs over time by a further £1 billion over this same period",pplm
