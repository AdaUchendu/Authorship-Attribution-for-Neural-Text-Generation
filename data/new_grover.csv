""poaching in rural areas was responsible for half of the wild animal deaths in the country last year,"" notes xinhua. ""however, a pandemic threat would have serious repercussions for man-made land and sea reserves in the country."" the story also claims that although planting and harvesting wild animals in all china's land will increase economic growth, ""the achievements of the 'hoarding' program won't impact the disappearing population in the countryside, which in turn will increase the rise in animal disease and poisoning,"" warns xinhua. meeking (n, n, lo, z) is a major chinese domestic ingredient found in pork, potatoes, meat, fish, beans, onions, heirloom tomatoes, poppers, avocados, sausages, and mushrooms. it is, of course, a key raw ingredient in a very expensive holiday chinese product. along with the medicinal and drug-using animals used to produce it, it also is a favorite among chinese farmers who sterilize and euthanize animals. the chinese government has at times said the practice is not the result of a hidden urban system, but a manufactured problem of animal health. not surprisingly, as vaccines for rare infections like measles and mumps, the chinese government at times has asked a second party to assist in the process.

4,"China's economy could shrink for the first time in decades because of the coronavirus beijing (cnn) — it might sound weird to describe chinese authorities as ""obsessed"" with the officially paralyzed. but i've encountered no more intense political intrigue than that in my days in the office of the chief medical examiner. last weekend, the beleaguered body office gave an extended memo detailing how the choking flu and respiratory infections that have taken the lives of hundreds of chinese of migrant workers — including many infants — could be pushed back into the months ahead. add a suspected coronavirus that threatens humans who use vaccines from around the world, and we're right in the middle of a tricky economic stretch. the mess is so bad that, on top of the containment problems, the national health and family planning commission last month ordered changes to the country's aging health system in an effort to slow the spread of infectious diseases. and in a single weekend, the government last month banned the dumping of refrigerated milk and food products which give off mysterious shingles. the ban stems from a contaminated ton tonnage that is used to carry tamiflu, a substance used to protect against most forms of flu, respiratory infections and other respiratory ailments. the ministry will appoint a chief medical officer to oversee the safety of all the food, water and medicine sold by the main earthen dams throughout the vast northeastern provinces, resulting in the first significant statewide closure of agricultural stocks over the next few days. in addition, the government is warning china's farmers to stay away from milk powder and flour that are being sold at a premium but contaminated with choline virus. ""the levy is already inadequate for safety,"" said mr. li wanxiang, the official at the ministry, who is the main symptom of the worst pandemic in china's modern history, saying the order, which he did not name, will cost farmers of at least 200 billion yuan ($21.4 billion) — three times the annual bill for the country's annual public hospital costs. ms. wang hongjie, director of china academy of social sciences, warned that complications that could flare up before a mid-stage coronavirus and the highly contagious respiratory infection that would cause ""major hospitalization."" ""it is clear that the current outbreak must be addressed and we must reduce pressure on the public health system,"" she said in a statement. after a bad but mild flu epidemic spread to roughly 26 million people in 2009, health authorities eventually settled on the carnavirus, which has infected more than 2 million people in china in the past three years. ten years later, china's spread has not been confined to the same patients. earlier this year, the fact that china's birth rate is lower than south korea indicates that it could become even more difficult for people to get sick due to this side-effects. if the infection continues to spread, ""it means that the virus could be in even greater danger of spreading to south korea,"" guo ping, an infectious disease expert at the chengdu institute of medical research, told cnn. we're far from seeing the end of china's deadly illness anytime soon. but if it seems like there are no major health problems this time around, it is — at least, short of monumental disasters like the 2010 beijing olympics pandemic. and the chinese people have invested far more in catching the first flu than they have in any other illness. indeed, 14 million people have been diagnosed with early stages of the illness in china since 2008. but the numbers are also increasing. at least five people are reported to have died as a result of illness, including last friday. until last week, this outbreak is easily treated by viral medicine, and medics in isolated cases are on the hunt for treatment options that are fatal in the short term. in addition, the relatives of victims who died are often ill from influenza in later stages of the disease, such as miscarriage or stillbirth. that's not bad. but the families of those who died are still waiting to see whether they'll recover. and is it any wonder that the most stressful part of my day is talking to the visiting traffic police out on the road? i can even hear the driver say, ""we have her. we will notify her.""",grover

6,"Coronavirus is fast becoming an 'economic pandemic' three years ago, around the same time studies on u.s. environmental and health claims indicating the disease was spreading all over the globe were launched, the country concerned was buzzing. the worst news was from the united states: 63 people died in 20 of the 50 countries tracked. a single but unrelated international outbreak in the pacific islands struck in early 2012, bringing the world's population in that area to 19.5 million people. but reports of global health-virus outbreaks across the globe, from britain to haiti to singapore, are starting to emerge anew and again as cases of acolytes dig deep into the form and symptoms and seek answers. globally, the number of people infected by something like the virus has climbed to 18,151, according to world health organization data. in the last eight months alone, some 1,132 cases of the disease have been diagnosed in countries around the world, not the least of which is canada and switzerland. ""this virus is making a lot of progress,"" says norman butler, a physician who has been chief health officer at the university of alberta in edmonton since 1997. ""it's very hard to guard your data from all sides, but where we are probably focused is on outbreaks. it can go away quickly."" the canadian government began an official observation count in march to determine whether there was an outbreak of virus activity and look for diseases that could be linked to it. that was backed up by a u.s. health department report last year that said canadian virus outbreaks were growing on average daily, up from 523 in 2007 to 524 in 2015. so where is the country with the largest number of cases of the disease (14,677)? not only is it the greatest health-village in the world, but there's also a tremendous appetite for talking about it. in 2003, then-premier of canada bill blair lambasted a ""name-brand"" study by national institute of health researchers that it linked canadian circulatory system issues to the virus, and a literature review revealed doctors could be relying on a cheaper and safer method to spot problems, if their symptoms do not show up soon. these types of outbreaks, experts say, offer opportunity to take a hard look at the whole picture: health experts can offer first aid and other tests and treatments to their patients and physicians to help diagnose conditions. and if the main concern is making sure the symptoms are not taken seriously, health-company professionals can help evaluate the causes before a disease is found, butler says. while virus transmission can be severe enough to cause severe pain, illness and death, people can become infected by mosquitoes carrying the virus or in infected people who carry it. and humans, particularly, don't respond well to it. smelly bugs require antibiotics to kill them. and to avoid infection, people should wear gloves. some germs should not infect anyone. the suspected strain of the virus is very hard to detect: like the toxin paralytic there is in some medical viruses, it can cause severe inflammation. the predominant cause of the disease is transmission of ""coronavirus"" to people in asia and australia that causes fever, diarrhea, white blood cells, spot attacks, osteoporosis and death. in some of these countries, the virus is infectious because it is transmitted among individuals. it is also highly contagious among live piglets. on the flip side, the reason why individuals are sick is out of respect for people who do not want to be infected. ""if people are not taken seriously it means they don't care and need to get tested,"" says butler. given that the risk is too high for those people, butler says he prefers taking the virus directly to the source. the recovery from outbreak patients requires some time and a willingness to listen and ask questions, he says. ""for individual cases i really like to go the steps of a responsible commercial health authority and ask them, 'how can we be the first to do this right?' "" he says. ""in the united states i don't really believe that this is something that we could easily do.""",grover
7,"A history of Wuhan, one-time Chinese capital and coronavirus epicenter wuhan city is set to experience a large-scale re-birth in its gastronomic history after a very long human migration through its rutted mountainous region during the 17th and 18th centuries. in an early-to-middle-20th century movie, jia baie, a chinese monk accused of harboring a handful of coffees, was gunned down in the middle of a village complex by a mob for threatening to shoot monks. the family moved to a high-profile monument in wuhan. many outsiders say this is part of a relic from a period when the city suffered bloody discontent and signs of modernization. many museums are closed, and festivals are wonky — now fun, but too much—in areas where the famous international hangouts can feel too ancient to cut these craftsmen down. making the re-birth to modernize and develop the capital itself, wuhan has been working to create a million-square-foot long-sea reconstruction center for local people. one of its tasks is to deface some of its rural neighborhoods with renovated mounds of eru with tak-e-ho limestone, bamboo homes and old and rotting old pagodas. if you see wuhan, look to katter's people's party district, which locals say is the region's last intact religious center. both katter's and district house the katter shilokum temple, one of the three a traditional pre-christian church: the area was occupied by ancient remnants from emperor ludwig at the beginning of the 17th century. some of the most important resting places are buried deep in the fields, including the hilltop tomb of silang and the tomb of dios jose. in this past fall, architect robert wagner left the city after much of the destruction of the temples and buildings, and the light has been slowly extinguished on past rains. but wagner appears to have shaken off the uncle"" reputation and people living in these neighborhoods often report being greeted or noticed by strangers. a stop at the 12th floor hotel up until the 19th century, wuhan was governed by a ku klux klan, and the school system was not regulated by the ku klux klan. organized by the kumbava minority group (today sowed fertile soil in the birthplace of myanmar), jews and poles started to cross to join the traditional chinese way of worship, which sought to demean and kill spiritual people by bringing them here. in 1895, the ku klux klan at the end of the period created a second ku klux klan in korea, which later pushed those to commit murder as much as the 20th century. by the early 1900s, the kwak monks in wuhan used to terrorize foreigners, living in an even more brutalized atmosphere — trapped in the drinking trough and literally a basement for begging. wuhan started to enjoy rapid modernization — including a massive reconstruction of the city itself — in the early 1920s, and its story started and then continued a long time later. many monuments in wuhan today have been rehabilitated, and will soon join a different story: they're modern and accommodating. on wednesday (april 5), the new wuhan architological center will open its doors to the public to create a new kind of monument to the glory days of the city. it will be located directly in the temple complex, said wagner, the head of the cultural heritage institute. ""an average person will have maybe twenty years of history, maybe two generations,"" wagner said. ""and with the renovation we're going to preserve it."" until now, the old temple buildings and monuments and roads have been neglected and had been built in neat rows. that must change, or the sacred building, a memorial on the hill side, will be converted into a museum with more than 300 artifacts — including ancient structures, tombs and temples. it will be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. follow william gold on twitter @timesreview.",grover

'belt and road initiative' the topic itself is no longer an issue. rather, it is about deepening our relations with china, helping it break free from washington. that it has succeeded in doing so is a major blunder in china's growing role in afghanistan, where it has been implicated in poisoning former chinese military personnel. president hamid karzai has made some constructive gestures towards china in recent months, but his administration is suspicious of beijing's failure to check proliferation in iraq or elsewhere. the us ambassador to china, andrew card, has consistently denounced china's vast economic expansion, or its military expansionist policies. correspondence has gained, but inevitably too many centres are following, says mr harver. the chinese-us ties were even warmer under mr karzai. 'impotent' mr card says that in contrast to washington's self-serving regime, beijing is essentially following its own dictates. he cites the following: any plan to restrict american influence in the region has had ""burdensome"" policy implications that affect china's security, says professor harver. the more assertive china's balance of power in the region, and the greater variety of regional problems, the more it will have to reassess its behaviour ""both sides will have a better idea of what to do, but it will also be under better communications and control"". ""somebody has got to convince us that both countries are progressing in the wrong direction, and this is unacceptable to us. we are anxious and worried. it has been the case throughout our history for us that if we pursue regional stability, it can only lead to crisis."" as for mr card, it has been said he, no matter how liberal he is, can't win national elections in order to run in beijing. hopefully he will get a second chance and work out a way to combat a campaign of sabre-rattling and stiff lobbying from washington. for chinese officials, our argument to washington is that their image is undermined by those who have demonstrated that beijing has no credibility. bookmark with: delicious digg reddit facebook stumbleupon what are these? e-mail this to a friend printable version",grover

""the latest findings suggest that the 777 and 787 pilots have carried out an extraordinary number of procedures designed to minimize risk to the public — often during crashes like the catastrophic explosion at tokyo electric power co's (tepco) crippled tokyo electric power co's (tep) takeda pacific power plant,"" the world health organization (who) and the u.s. federal aviation administration (faa) said in a joint statement. wirke examined 118 of the six 737 max series planes that originated in china, before the boeing 787 made its debut in china in december 2011, relying on noise surveys to determine its effects on the airframe, climate, engines and manufacturing of the plane. those data, which may yield more conclusive proof of the risks to human health, were independently reviewed by researchers for the new study. some published responses contained errors, and some did not include error reporting. none of the 16 cases suspected of being the chicago tragedy has been reported by the faa. wirke said the 737 max was responsible for an increase in catastrophic failure in the period between 2007 and 2011, and that the boeing 737 max was part of the 737 max, rather than the 737 max one, the fourth-generation model of the plane. he said passengers affected by the latest cases had previously been accounted for on the same 14 boeing aircraft. ""the black box in the fatal crash of an entire a320, for example, would give officials any proof they could have contained the aircraft,"" wirke said. ryanair holdings chief executive michael o'leary has said the 787 remains the most serious of all the business jets he operates. the shares of pan american silver corp. fell nearly 20 percent on monday after receiving the report. wirke said the faa wouldn't risk changing the software that prompts an airliner to refuel, saying that such software complies with safety and security rules. wirke said the reports will be monitored closely by ntsb, the federal aviation administration and the national transportation safety board, but would not imply any definitive conclusion. in the latest report, he and co-author paul mccoy produced experiments that are ""further necessary to ascertain what caused the catastrophic failure"" of the boeing 787 dreamliner, and are still ""fantastic"" in their assessment of their findings, he said. all the reports are open-ended, including all types of possible explanations for the accidents, the faa said. ""we will continue to share all studies and findings on this matter, including the ability of the max's engines to produce the maximum noise through a combination of fire suppression and suppression of the airframe."" researchers also examined six other potential causes, including the boeing 787's most basic causes of impact. federal officials have acknowledged that airliners can suffer vast ignition peaks when the engines fuse. but they said that involved variables such as rapid acceleration, the amount of noise and other unexpected items, as well as the efficiency of the 737 max engine. others are uncertain. in april 2014, investigators found that only about 20 percent of the 63 passengers aboard the anheuser-busch inbev (bud.b) airlines group's anheuser-busch inbev a, the world's largest brewer, experienced significant engine instability during the ascent of the autoclave-like pratt & whitney 6126 engine. in 2017, faa inspectors found also that an airplane jet engine attached to a pressurized body cavity did not spark during the ascent, the airframe's fires were relatively minor and fuel consumption was typically lower than average. in cases that may have increased fuel consumption, the investigators said, a jetjet pressurized body cavity ""could have caused the engine to fuel up"" and the fuselage to burn off.",grover

""the virus we have today has a variety of problems which we can monitor, monitor, diagnose, monitor -- and that's why we've implemented new measures to monitor diseases,"" cdc director tom frieden said at the white house on friday.

""because of the first three outbreaks, the virus was not detected, and we believe that we need to treat it with a lot more precautions, and that we need to protect people through preventative measures,"" frieden said. since then, however, the cdc has conducted tests on thousands of patients in san francisco, berkeley, boulder, colorado, camden, virginia beach, delaware, and san diego. almost all are still being treated for the virus, which is likely not so much a cause-and-effect difference in the two outbreaks. but a lot of them are now becoming painfully obvious, as several schools have said that they will see reduced use of free blood pressure medication or run more blood pressure screenings. university of maryland medical school communications coordinator catherine roske told cnn that she was ""waiting for our heart rate monitor to be positive"" at a meeting of the college's fire department on wednesday morning. she added that she thinks it's just a matter of time before students return to campus and that it will be the most hazardous situation they've ever seen.

27,"What the US can learn from Singapore's coronavirus strategy by elaine lies and louisa catlett san francisco, april 5 (cnn) — silicon valley investors and leaders now think so hard about singapore's coronavirus strategy. singapore is the fourth-largest country in the world for swine flu. it is also the first to have both an internationally used antiviral (h3n2) vaccine and a vaccine that is only effective against rabies. so what can the united states learn from singapore's policy? here are three things we can learn about the importance of coronavirus research: cradivalis: ""cradivalis,"" based on the genes lmls (meaning genetic variation) have in h3n2, is one of the few broad and widely used vaccine that we can enjoy. if you use lmls, you won't have a lot of protection against the spread of influenza. it's difficult to accurately isolate genes in a vaccine. for example, virus can pass on an antibody that is infected by two viruses, flu and now pandemic influenza, and which scientists say is a potential source of this deadly strain of flu. targeting remarks: researchers and clinicians in singapore use radio frequencies to transmit germs and models that target them. when patients are in the unit of care they are expected to take an antigen of high availability or intense resistance, which means they will encounter less resistance than if they were on the same unit of care for an extremely common virus. that's what's happened to some models that catch h3n2 infections in laboratories. in the meantime, patients who are resistant to pre-emptive radiosarcom (known as phase 1/2 mutations) will not have an antiviral against pandemic influenza. if you go to a hospital and double your defibrillator when the virus is on the other side, you might be infected. gastrises: a similar approach has taken place in other countries, but this is a new opportunity for the united states to use it in singapore. the primary reason for this is that people are more likely to talk with their doctors about vaccines, so the doctors' questions have less scientific value. singapore uses five different types of microphones to listen to patients' talking heads. the microphones have different listening patterns, so if the respiratory therapist is listening to a patient, they're more likely to hear what they're saying. according to a government fact sheet, up to 18 million people in singapore have exposure to influenza during their lifetime and therefore exposures to influenza can reach the critical threshold that has already reached. scientists believe that vaccine-effectively controlled infection rates should be recommended for childhood children. ""we believe it's simply too late for people to get infected,"" the document read. cradivalis: ""cradivalis is the right vaccine to prevent flu,"" the statement said. we don't like talk from a family doctor to infants, but it doesn't seem too tough to get vaccinated by a family doctor. it also doesn't appear to protect young infants. toesult: through different collection methods from different risk factors, it looks like it's likely to work. the virus also gets stronger, and children who meet three different risk factors are more likely to develop the flu. ""when people start having symptoms, they don't talk to the person who's sick,"" said dr. andras weiss, chief executive of every day i bite is blood and soil research firm. cazies: a section of china's anti-flu strategy recommends the use of a filtering vaccine such as a cnerbac with modified viruses. cnerbac is an antigens vaccine, according to a recent report in the macomb daily. it's protective against six diseases. every day i bite, the antiviral in the acronym, recommends hearing german speakers talk about the flu virus. serciphrans: singapore is one of only two countries that have ever manufactured a humane work-around-vaccine. the import-export exemption, or scovir), lets doctors hire community veterinarians to test the flu virus and eliminate cases within 48 hours. small islands and faraway parts of the world have limited test results, but this exemption has been seen in the united states, sweden, turkey and france.",grover

""i ask patients at the highest risk, especially among the disabled, if they don't have a cataract – another reason that every doctor wants to give them a second chance at vaccination,"" says dr. tom dornier, director of mcla and author of ""a better, more affordable, preventive health shot program"" dr. matthew a. mcquaid, mcla's director of community based therapeutics (ci), has been the first to advise women about vaccines. the ci program works by prescribing pain medications to women and women who may be taking anti-inflammatories – those who've suffered from painful side effects such as weak stomach muscles or tendons – to prevent back pain. there are medications available to make sure women get a well-rounded vaccine through ci and cervical shot. these are the first women's shots that patients received from ci and given before their bodies started rejecting their anti-inflammatories, results in high-focal-nanolytic antibodies. if they don't react, patients have a flu-like effect, resulting in serious side effects. in determining what shots are best, health experts advise that women in their range of 85-90 days after they've been on anti-inflammatories face five weeks of best-case-before-they-disease prevention, with a red flag warning that they may have post-inhibitor side effects. ""if they don't adhere to their initial dose of antibiotics, they may feel better and maybe go home and take a shower,"" says dr. johnson. ""i urge women to talk with their physicians and if they have persistent side effects – it could be very dangerous to take these medications, which are highly recommended."" if you or someone you know needs a shot, or someone you know has been diagnosed with illness, get tested or can show up at the ci clinic. call 800-225-3146 or visit specialist health programs at nmdc here.",grover

""we must not let it deplete our potential as women."" malala and her mother, muhammad yousafzai, the third taliban leader to be killed since the sept. 11, 2001, attacks, are in recent days bearing witness to the heroic effort by the united states and afghanistan to make a difference for their oppressed brethren in the world's poorest country. while government officials and the public of afghanistan have encouraged violence against women, many foreign troops have been harshly criticized for sending in female support soldiers and for sometimes killing them. many girls and women sit at remote tribal camps in neighboring pakistan, where powerful tribes from neighboring pakistan have allied with al qaeda.

""a thousand these people must die in suicide attacks by suicide,"" yousafzai's voice added. ""how many people's lives can we afford to put down to suicide attacks and renege on?"" she said the afghan army would be the last word, but the trend it had to learn to counter, will ultimately be their undoing.

(our digital unit had been a company we controlled so i didn't want to do a specialized deal for someone else. but this past quarter the company has had another impressive quarter, selling through the first quarter of 2014 that proves the company is still incredibly new.) i had the pleasure of speaking with marc-andre and asked him to write his new book. his enthusiasm and enthusiasm – as he likes to say, ""social marketing."" he was very enthusiastic about the book and told me to read it, so i did. i think i know the underlying lessons and what we are hoping to learn from the upcoming year. of course, sometimes a book is the only answer for a new problem. however, i did focus on the very early market challenges i worked against, and what we are using these as templates for future growth. year-to-date, our sales rate for current business has increased, and we are using our strategy of strategically investing in the next six months and aggressively building upon our leadership and leadership momentum. the choices we are choosing this year are many. the best way to move forward will be with a strong execution and consolidation of resources which will allow us to be the best competitor, to grow our penetration and sell more to key global markets.",grover
31,"Latest Headlines on CNN Business the latest on the broadcast of cnn's ""hot topics"" 1:30 p.m. cnn room leaders are firing on all cylinders for a complete redesign of the newsroom of cnn's first newsroom since the network announced its $450 million investment. hiring veteran senior-level editors has ""tremendous admiration"" for what cnn has given its veterans, president jeff zucker says. in announcing the change, zucker says he wants cnn room executives to become more like major advertisers or companies such as amazon.com and comcast. he also says they should have ""a much better taste"" for which companies they are buying, without going for tech-heavy products. zucker then repeats why c-span is a great product. in recent months, cnn has spent $1.5 billion on television advertising. its new newsroom of 56 staffers will have the largest newsroom in u.s. history, zucker says. cnn chief medical correspondent cynthia hurd will report out of the existing 42 newsrooms, but zucker says changes were already made in a pilot program before the recent annual political conventions. late night anchor jim cooper is the anchor of cnn's syndicated cast from atlanta. 10:00 a.m. mtv networks' decision to revamp its programming has already sparked big protests from petition-writer drew barrymore. the lawsuit filed by barrymore's mother, oscar-winning filmmaker and father -- and because of campaign meddling in the stories -- came after the network said they had chosen not to greenlight some shows. the network denied reports that one of the shows turned down came in response to requests for information about the scripts they had sent to agents. they referred all of the requests to abc, nbc and the networks from people who had signed the petition, the lawsuit says. five shows are on the air, including ""comedy central's the nightly show with katie couric,"" ""late night with seth meyers,"" ""late show with david letterman,"" and jimmy kimmel live. abc says the move has been modeled after similar moves in other parts of the industry. 9:35 a.m. cnn's ""hot topics"" has become one of the hottest talking points of the day. anderson cooper had a lot of time last week touting cnn's renewed commitment to its signature content lineup and his new facebook page, and in his outtake the network has taken its invitation to biznoms, an election focused in the close race for governor in california. cooper ran as the presidential nominee in 2015, although trump won in 2016, in part because of a rise in media influence in california. the show's audience grew from 4.5 million viewers last october to 7.5 million this past march. that spread has combined with rising cable viewership. but liberal accusations of rampant corruption within cnn have made the room a political rival to rival national news outlets. its predecessor, ""the new york times,"" has for years been examining how members of the military were elected to congress and the military commissions, which carry mandatory jail terms. 9:50 a.m. cnn's efforts to ""advance the health of our nation"" and win elections have already led to some serious criticisms about its coverage of president donald trump's travel ban. the network's critics say it's not on par with similar offerings from previous administrations. a poll released last week found that 50 percent of cnn viewers are still undecided about who to believe. voters in alabama, missouri, oklahoma and tennessee also expressed suspicion about the network's coverage. the survey found that 66 percent of those surveyed either favored trump or believed it to be dishonest, including 55 percent of those with unfavorable opinions.",grover

34,"The movies that predicted an outbreak like coronavirus i always expect more than one outbreak after each one. i've worked for several companies — gm foods, solicynews, six flags, panera — which have been able to forecast more than one outbreak in more than 30 countries. unfortunately, it's not only these kinds of employees that have missed outbreaks, but also supervisors. every company has an unannounced instance of crisis. it's almost impossible to tell what's behind it. a total of eight of our 11 diagnostic businesses have witnessed outbreaks, according to a cnn factcheck investigation last week. both flint, flint, ohio, and cleveland were seen months apart. flint is also one of three jurisdictions nationwide that produce or manufacture recombinant bacterial strains of e. coli, according to a research paper from global health dataset. so what kind of outbreaks we have experienced? it's relatively simple: a large majority of the outbreak comes from a small number of labs across the country. in mississippi, there have been 16 outbreaks of e. coli in 44 states. in alaska, there have been five reports of a freeze-up outbreak, and four of the five clusters in new hampshire have been confirmed. people in more developed countries have reported outbreaks more than 30 times in different geographic areas. the main reason? in developing countries, outbreaks of e. coli can be traced to abroad. in major iaea member states, in clinical emergencies, outbreaks are reported from local sources. in the us, 25 outbreaks of e. coli have been recorded. in iceland, there have been more than 20 reports of more than one outbreak. in ireland, a complete list of more than 20 outbreaks has been compiled. when you add these outbreaks to reports of a similar outbreak, it's a lot more likelier that you find outbreaks in other countries. in canada, a total of 39 outbreaks have been recorded. in western europe, outbreaks have been reported when local ones happen before this outbreak has grown. but the following countries have had major outbreaks: davos glen dorough katy hope jennie bell julian wole late ludwig johnsen edmund groppinger femi kuehne who can say with confidence about what happened at the pittsburgh food group in 2013? in a separate cnn factcheck investigation, the washington post reported on just three or four outbreaks in 2016. that means 9,163 cases have been reported and more than 275 illness warnings. the following is from a 2013 cnn report, making no mention of any of the outbreaks in western europe: like many of the countries, western europe has a very strong code of conduct for outbreaks. a buzzfeed story reported that lehigh county administration officials missed the first world war outbreak of tuberculosis in 1903, according to a 2016 npr profile. our research at righthand, a nonprofit based in fergus, ireland, found similar trends with respect to outbreaks in asia. in early 2017, we reported on a virus outbreak that has caused about 350 illnesses in 13 countries. all of the outbreaks reported were health-related. i don't think an outbreak of zika can be estimated as high as 2014 because we had such high infections when the outbreak was less severe. similarly, we have seen increases in obesity, the human-peptide-nutritional value factor, and other obesity-related diseases since the 2010 outbreaks. for an outbreak to catch on the scale of a normal outbreak, it has to have included some major outbreaks that do not exist before. the goal, then, is to prepare the public for these outbreaks. of course, not everyone can detect a virus early. they can fail to alert the public, lose trust in reporting, or even want to risk police action. especially once serious illnesses are suspected, coverage of outbreaks can shrink. but just as an outbreak of ritz, summer fever, or cold war-era toxins prevented large outbreaks, so could come from a virus far from sick.",grover

""we are unaware of any deaths, but unfortunately there is no hospital treatment,"" scranton, pennsylvania-based universal pictures said in a statement. the delay comes nearly five years after the icp was discovered in living mice, the rare mutation that is the hallmark of an isolated coronavirus of the same name. multiple centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) officials released the official report explaining how a coronavirus that appeared in mouse colonies on television in 2014 had spread to infect at least 150 countries. a team of 68 cdc officials was also involved in the research. the cdc officials said an investigation revealed that coronavirus testing in humans is well enough advanced to know it wasn't just the mouse's immune system that created the virus. cnn reached out to the makers for comment but was not immediately able to reach a representative, daren tsui, the acting director of the cdc. he told cnet in an email that the company continues to investigate the investigation into the incident and many others that followed. ""we are working closely with our laboratory partners to identify the cause and patient histories and other relevant local and national information from a timely test procedure so we can determine the cause and effect of this recent viral outbreak,"" he wrote.",grover

41,"Pete Davidson doesn't exactly stretch much in 'Big Time Adolescence' for those of you without a smartphone, surfing the net, binge-watching your favorite shows or chatting to up your friends, you're in luck: you have a virtual jack russell terrier named donny in the movie big time adolescence. seriously, for non-prime-time comers, it seems like donny is kind of the sure-fire poster child for the internet's shtick of juvenile, slapstick, borderline offensive jokes. sure, his interactions with the people he meets (who, i know, are similar to us, but their appeal is much more specific) are essentially non-existent in ""trolls"" and ""potterheads,"" but the character is actually comedic and stunningly human. perhaps he and ray bradbury would have created a nicer reputation for donny in the 1980s than himself and jake gyllenhaal, the actor known for a vocal singing voice in ""baby love."" donny seems to be a lovable type, not spiteful. sound familiar? while talking to one of the two characters, daniel dae kim, donny is able to articulate that his aim is for ray bradbury's ""do the right thing"" and put so much effort into it that he looks and acts like none other than three giant puppet ears with the occasional you-know-what at their mercy. donny would easily be the best of the family in ""trolls,"" and its precise opening scene about a pair of human kids playing carnival sports is kind of gross. smashing down candles donny is not a person, unlike most puppet/monster characters, that is actually scary. the juxtaposition with ""big time adolescence"" sends a perfectly justified sense of dread and guilt: death, i know, but are you just like me when i wake up tomorrow and find a pool of scary twins hovering around my head? donny doesn't seem to have inherited the nastiness of the ""trolls"" character. these adorable kids are cruelly being yanked by donny's late mother, and it's become a point of tension not only with donny but with everyone around them. even donny's father paul likes him. the fact that donny is much more aware of the fact that benji [his onscreen dad], who is stuck with the only thing that will help him out from the insanity is pinching us, is not enough to make the ""trolls"" character any less awful. donny is not just looking to fit in. he wants to live his life to the fullest, and as such, it's quite scary that donny might morph into a bear. really, there's nothing really like a ""trolls"" character in movies that need to grow into their nuanced, realistic selves. the colors and the songs make the character all the more complicated. in ""trolls,"" the slight, indispensable addition is that donny recognizes our loneliness, and he doesn't just accept it as part of life, but even among the other humans. and while we're at it, donny fills donny with a poignancy about his vulnerability. donny's relationship with ray bradbury i know they got to do a superb job of capturing the fact that a person with a digitally homogenized face has tremendous power, but maybe donny can help amp up the illusion. as does his father paul, who is supposed to be donny's way of expressing his feelings. with this monologue put together, donny and ray try to cope with the reality that we feel as though we really only have one identity: we feel way too much. just don't go to the movies with us.",grover

""i'm always a little scared of swimming,"" she said. ""they said i shouldn't do that, they were just thinking i was a little scared. but i don't even notice how much it makes me want to give up."" so she and her two high school buddies, emma watson and justin gatlin, opened a tennis club in summer 2017, and they've grown to share the experience and encouragement they get along with tennis. ""we all enjoy tennis,"" watson said. ""there's that teen personality, me as a teenager who loves it. i am a huge admirer. i was thinking of piers morgan a few years ago when i was in a promotional role for wondercon. i had met him. i asked if he could come to one of my events and he was very sweet."" eighteen-year-old dyan kovan, the team's seventh-grade junior, will compete at level 1 this summer at canyon meadows. but kovan's place is, well, hers. to make kovan, a former ucla and usc star, feel more of a player, she will need to sign all seven of her junior and senior letters of recommendation by now. kovan hopes to become a u.s. open winner. she says, ""my second goal is to go to the elite level. my goals are to improve a little bit as an athlete and play a little bit more tennis. i'm trying to achieve the goals you'd want."" and finally, there's ajay singh, who is on top. singh, who has been playing tennis for the last 13 years, has survived the stress of rising to the top in the world and is on the verge of making it all the way to the final of his first atp u.s. open.

""we have an incident to answer,"" silverstein told deadline in los angeles, which reported tuesday that the cast had come to the studio to check on mcginnis, who suffered a medical-induced infection. ""there is no reason to leave him where he is,"" silverstein said. for more, check out the 90-second clip below. the delay is from the intention to change the location of the new york premiere from seattle to l.a. this could mean several additional episodes have to be filmed at century city or elsewhere. the novel ""riverdale"" was ordered for syndication in 2012 and was scheduled to air on american tv in 2013. as a writer/producer for the tv series, silverstein has spent the last 10 years feeling left out of the creative process because the new batch of episodes is such a large budget. we couldn't help but notice, however, that the episodes about the characters — who may be fictional — are often shot right in the studio. ""riverdale"" was originally produced for a limited run, but network executives have decided to cancel it. ""riverdale"" is part of usa's scoop tv, a digital format around information and entertainment in which tv series are released without the rest of the tv content. as for whether or not the move will impact the finale of ""riverdale,"" silverstein is still hopeful for her characters.

""the view"" may have created a new image for itself, but abc had hoped the characters represented on the program would bolster ratings. megan fox has long said the show evolved from a depiction of a subservient white house view of hollywood. that era -- the mccarthy era -- was dominated by politicians who controlled power from the oval office for decades. here are four white house-era shows that would work better in your living room: ""terms of endearment"" yes, ""terms of endearment"" is a comedy about the executive who romantically accuses the member of congress and the press of having sexual conquests. some might say the series highlights this particular man, but even the gay audience probably won't help this one. ""terms of endearment"" has stars bill pullman, zoe saldana and gloria delgado-pritchett playing a largely straight man from the san francisco to washington, d.c. that suggests its writer daniel valsky isn't afraid to embrace the male-centric approach to storytelling, rather than usher in a new era for male characters. this might be the best show to have left for tv in years, but it still has many drama subplots and comedy. in ""terms of endearment,"" the popular dr. oliver north is portrayed by ryan murphy, who is the emmy winner behind shows like ""ugly betty."" the series' recurring segment examines the relationship between the man trying to woo dr. oliver and the male journalist. ""colbert report"" this is another ""talk show."" the ""colbert report"" segment may have a gentler working relationship with politics than its predecessor. according to the wall street journal, researchers for a new study commissioned by comedy central and broadcast news-talk shows said colbert's show, which averaged 13.6 million viewers a week during its ""colbert report"" run, was not only critical, but up 21% from a year ago. ""colbert report"" is a punchy, political comedy about the movements of everyday people, including the american civil liberties union and white supremacists. some may say ""colbert report"" is overrated, but at least it has a compelling story to tell.",grover

65,"How to Watch VR starting this summer, all 3 million vr headsets will be available. this year's headsets are expensive and some are even locked down for near the end of the year, but because they give you access to the whole world, there are so many choices you can be active without losing out on cost, though. so to see how you can attend some of the best vr experiences in the world with your smartphone — like those many alternatives have. here are five things you should know about those vr headsets and oculus rift for the first time. 1. unlike standard vr headsets, the oculus rift and rift pro have only apps. you can search, play, unlock, support gps and control the camera, navigate menus, ask questions, create faces and much more. video apps allow you to choose from more than just the apps you want to use, however. they have, thanks to 3d handheld, a pair of ar glasses and a built-in headset that allows the phones to feel the virtual reality of their iphones or apple's ipad. they have pre-loaded vive 4k and logitech's virtual headset that also works with standard oculus rift and the htc vive. as with vr apps, only this prototype headset is built around the final high-end version of the oculus rift, the faster version. oculus' own hackable vive is about the same size and cheaper than other headsets but adds motion control and drag-and-drop support. this makes this immersive experience much more accessible to more people. to use this model, try no sleep mode with an on-board smartphone, and if using the htc vive via a standalone vr headset, you'll get the ability to watch your augmented reality experiences, enjoy some games, build your own virtual reality pad and have a few small games, download some games and then move on to the next one. 2. you'll need to have a vr headset to make oculus rift vr compatible. oculus, like many competitors like samsung and htc, made their headsets available with virtual reality apps with oculus rift. on the oculus rift's website, you can see that you can use oculus rift in conjunction with apps for more than two million vr headsets. for those that only work with vr, please post your vr experience to your facebook account, or follow oculus or facebook into the oculus app stores. more importantly, if you need a vr headset that you can control from your phone, oculus rift is you. thanks to its shiny new build, oculus rift vr requires only a few apps, has 50,000 titles and downloads and has the ability to use in-game co-op for free. 3. you can set up your own vr experience. you can use a tablet that you choose to keep held up, tablet or camera. you can set up a showroom setup, photograph with your self, store your files and organize your characters. the goal is to you: create your own unique vr experience. at this point, you can't tell how far you want to go. special instructions are posted on oculus' website for telling some of the key questions you should pose before engaging with oculus rift vr. for example, if you don't want to see your character appear on screen and then you're unsure of which mode to explore, set up your own oculus rift vr experience and quickly. at this point, you will find it easy to experience oculus rift vr content, as well as the virtual world. 4. you'll need a headset which can support 3d printing. like the iphone 7, the 3d printing app apple produces is based on current technology but includes such things as 3d printers and virtual reality headsets. with the 3d printers, you don't have to worry about labor and design fees or product costs. look at this example of how to build your own virtual reality experience that comes with oculus rift. image credit: vosdra/ shutterstock/blunda 5. you can trade in your rift and rift pro for a wider array of vr headsets. oculus rift-based virtual reality headsets are limited to one type of vr experience. you can choose to sit under the oculus app and build your own vr experience. you can also spend more time with your rift pro or rift pro pro directly off the oculus rift and htc vive. you can just enjoy watching your vr experiences now. don't ask where vr technology is headed. either way, there is the option for buying vr headsets just in time for your next ride in the park.",grover

(below, streaming video of the show has been posted.) since that first xfinity 360 event, some 4,500 registered users have been surveyed and admitted to accessing facebook, twitter, linkedin, search engines, weibo, blogs, comment boards, and other smart-card services from a roomful of familiar faces. just look at the clues: facebook is known for its emphasis on privacy. to facebook, it means that you don't really trust who you're with anymore, even if you're using a social network to find your closest friends, because who are you? nobody trusts their friends! google is using its android app to email your spouse, or your housemate, or your kids, or maybe your kid's otherworldly hiding place. google+ (nasdaq:goog) is living up to its promise of providing ""social network"" personality and more. marketing is good, too. to facebook, in 2008, synergy llc, or professional advertising league, a madison avenue marketing consulting firm, did a study measuring how much of a segmented user marketing had left to offer and how it might influence the success of a product or service. you probably think it was just a survey, because marketing is, by its nature, weird. facebook and twitter are the place to be the next generation of office workers. your future has opportunities to be found in as little as 15 seconds. being the #2 communications messaging app in the world is a pretty close call. ok ok. actually, the same goes for almost every website at facebook. as of last year, social media has multiplied. in the u.s., more than half of the more than 230 billion users were without internet access, meaning that you have to find your way around the web. without it, you couldn't conquer the entire world. yet for you, the internet is your place and your holy grail. for those worried about corporate friendliness, a conversation with a bank might help you find your way around the globe. big, sure, but the simple facts tell a lot about the nature of the internet itself. just look at the sites we are now blessed with and the possibilities. in the u.s., corporate friends are welcome to visit the hundreds of sites on the internet. as things stand today, techies aren't welcome to park in front of the official yelp property. but they are permitted to hang out at facebook, twitter, linkedin, google+ and other social networks, sitting right next to where the ceo sits -- they may have more control over who they say is meeting with and who they attend than anyone else. that's why you will miss it. since it came to the internet with its souped-up market, social networks are far less attractive to individual customers who don't realize that your organization and your target market change constantly, making it even harder to succeed in their new world of online communities. at the most, the good friendliness and ephemerality of social networks is very much lost. yet the signs are that anyone who pays attention to social networks now, through the desktop and the mobile, will suddenly see the light. but first, keep an eye on google and twitter to see how they compare with the web. if google, for example, sees tweets with the appropriate keywords (linkedin, myspace, myspace music), it's possible the search company will finally bring google+ to facebook. don't be scared. let's see how things pan out.",grover

""modi is scheduled to arrive in india on tuesday and meet people from hindu minority communities in chennai,"" jaitley's spokesman saifullah shahi told cnn. at least 24 dead among the dead were four paramilitary troopers, who were taking part in military operations when clashes erupted, shahi said. coast guard and a security force rushed to the spot, and investigations revealed that the crowd, numbering more than 24,000 people, was concentrated in the city of melaka, a district in assam state, on the border with india's neighboring state of assam. ""the state was divided, with many p/l jamia masjid are demolished and so the whole area is in chaos,"" said m.k. zarifaju, an adviser to bjp president amit shah. kurdish nationalists of the dalit community clashed with muslims over plans to build a mini-military prison near the border between the two states, triggering clashes during the evening rush hour, shahi said. the incident underscored tensions between muslims and sikhs, an ethnic group of which more than 700,000 people live on the borders of assam and gujarat, the federal government said. the army, which has fought four wars and has military personnel stationed in kashmir, was deployed to assist in the crisis, including the command post, officials said.

""the temperature at the pacific ocean was quite below the long-term average of australian to asia temperatures — close to minus 13,"" said alcon ltd.'s chief operating officer, alvin lesher. ""this translated directly into the virus reaching the australian mainland."" for reasons still unknown, a total of 9,000 objects in a sample (two objects, a paddle and a variety of things) were tested in the same humidity area around california beach in california. most of the objects were made of solid gold, although the results were startling: the small particles were 7/10 inch in diameter.

""these kind of pieces make your throat boil. this might mean the virus takes root,"" he said. the australian model is extremely conservative, and with no explanation why so much of the test results weren't from the ocean near california beach. it's possible that the scientists aren't familiar with the value of the ultraviolet radiation that makes the glittering dust at the beach far hotter. one possibility is that the pockets of air trapped in the virus do not move through open up areas on wind farms, dr. perry carrington of the australian department of health told cnn's stephanie fazio.

110,"Stranded lobsters and missing wedding dresses: The coronavirus' global reach (cnn) — medical experts say that platoons of rotting rotting lobsters serve as proof of the presence of a plonic immune system—the same that indicates the presence of melon-infused chemicals. if the pink, oil-based wares, such as pebble and ribena were borne of a local presence, global adoption of the virus could lead to free-market outbreaks, said joshua blatz, director of the florida-based division of the institute for genomic research at georgetown university. ""now, in combination with our research, what we have found is the connection of the plonic immune system to the gastroenterology,"" blatz said. ""one may wonder if this could turn out to be a bactericide, that's easy to mistake."" studies don't exist yet to link contaminated lobsters with host disease, but parts of their body do appear to harbor multiple immune toxins that can cause other infections, including gonorrhea, h1n1 and crohn's disease, health officials warn. south korean scientists say they've found a strain of the bacteria they use as an influenza vector and are investigating it to see if other bacteria are responsible for contamination. it could lead to diseases caused by pathogens that go through various stages of distribution and where particles do not have any active interaction with host cells, and result in foodborne germs, according to the nature journal's chart below. armed with data from about 2,100 lobsters that survived at least a decade in north korea and previously unknown locations in south korea, researchers say they've detected a large percentage of the plonic immune system. the presence of any new strain could raise concerns about a risk of serious disease outbreaks, although there's no evidence of the disease being transmitted from land to home. ""we would like to see more data available,"" said dr. fred flanagan, an epidemiologist at the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta. flanagan said the transmission risks for plonic immunity in the transplant population vary, with no clear connection between proteins used in plonic immunity, but proteins made by those affected by the infection are particularly susceptible to the plonic immune system. the presence of some genes linked to plonic immunity would provide further information about the novel interaction between proteins, and could lead to a more coordinated response, he said. in haiti, victims of an apparently natural host disease—chronic acute acute crohn's disease—are suffering from viral diarrhea in the same way as counterparts, because their immune systems are still different than those produced in land to new sites in the developing world, blatz said. the bacteria in port-au-prince, haiti, may have almost fully vaccinated the rare microbe, he said. ""it could be the first time in a century that there is a disease outbreak in [the outbreak area], and we wouldn't know how to prevent it,"" he said. recent genetic studies have shown the bacterium in fruit flies, which are members of the plonic immunodeficiency virus (poin), to be in close proximity to their host cells. while plonic immunity in patients is more limited than for modern patients, the study suggests it could be able to target cells that assemble fragments of the fruit fly. this will allow researchers to potentially identify early stage cases and shut down the viral epidemic. scientists are especially concerned by the phenomenon of plonic and cyber disease clusters—they are responsible for leaving bacteria in the cells to incubate in a pre-existing environment. ""it's important to understand that the burden of plonic immunity is so low that it impacts other immune systems, and would be able to control bacterial spread,"" blatz said.",grover

""southwest has always been an exemplary student-teacher partnership."" he referenced a statement from the federal u.s. department of education, in which it said it is trying to ""level the playing field"" by increasing participation among children and giving parents equal access to appropriate accommodations. southwest said in a statement that it supports a more equal access policy for students, but ""we recognize that differences in performance will create a complex environment in which we all encounter."" some parents are expecting more in the way of reassurance that the airline will comply with the federal government's guidelines on seats, while some are concerned that the company has been too aggressive and is letting some kids take the seat. but to do the better job, students from these elementary schools will have to work to establish ties with the airline. it's not clear yet whether they can figure out how to fulfill their goals. which is good. if you find yourself tempted to cry uncle, maybe you are more interested in some kind of friendship or relationship with your babysitter.",grover

""in his life, my father and i did everything together because we wanted to be in control of our household,"" says starr. ""we wanted to send that trash back to the people on our island."" it's a process that can take years. starr says his tires are less than two feet tall and he wants to release a letter i love. you can shoot him a paper bag and throw it into it. or you can use the fabric-lined mattress that starr and his husband are building. and that's just the tip of the iceberg. designers are starting to look beyond plastic into roofs and walkways, where even your trim is a plastic wrapper that can just fit on a bank of pants. worldwide, the majority of recycling material is being poured in recycling containers, and some experts predict recycling will surpass the amount used in incineration by 2030. ""the world has already surpassed the amount of plastic that was used in the 1990s,"" says mikael hilkevicius, an expert in material recycling at muckenthaler, a chemical engineering institute in brooklyn, new york. ""you start somewhere."" but there's another factor in the shift. mother nature's surprising inclination to recycle is affecting the world's garbage bills. roughly 400 million cubic meters of solid waste — lots of germs, rotting plants, rotten grass — has been dumped in the united states since 2004, according to the environmental protection agency. in 2015, the government spent $22.3 billion to house its excess waste in peru, mexico and chile. twenty-three years later, garbage rates are still the lowest in the world and sustainability advocates say this has nothing to do with growth. ""the challenge here is the sustainability that goes with recycling on paper. if you remove the plastic bags, the same thing can happen to bricks that we give to the superfund sites or the environmental authorities to clean our trash,"" says hilkevicius. with so much trash coming out of our homes, with so little oversight, waste management has become increasingly important in protecting our environment. just as the gps remains a livewire and peacekeeper, the marine life in our oceans is also becoming a greater threat to ours. humanity has made many changes to the oceans to accommodate the human waste we ship into them, and it may not be worth it to the environment to just send the waste our way. still, the international debate about plastic and composting doesn't seem to be slowing down. the 2015 pew charitable trusts study shows that methane, an important contributor to climate change, will peak at a us average rate of 16 percent by 2030. just as deforestation didn't stop but ended, so is recycling. the land that our planet once used for our food, water and medicine is falling into tremendous garbage disposal pits, according to a cnn analysis from the year 2017, dropping to less than 80,000 acres of landfill-filled land a day. and that's just the tip of the iceberg. ""it was never the volume of tons of garbage that we'd had before 2001,"" starr says. ""in the last decade, we've seen an unexpected surge of trash pouring into the oceans and rivers.""",grover
132,"When the coral disappears, so will they × when the coral disappears, so will they (cnn) — it's great that there's a biannual coral reef break off the mississippi river as folks head out for a late spring barbecue. but you might know a certain section of the river that may contain a new supply of stuff. you could count on there's been a huge coral-tied move. the mississippi river corals, which have already been felled, are set to disappear, off the coast of alabama. and the u.s. geological survey published a new report tuesday that concludes that the so-called ""exotic reef of the south"" will disappear at some point in the next 100 years or so, displacing some 1.3 million people across alabama's 3,000 miles of the u.s. northeast. it means that every two days, more than 1.6 million people, either starting and retired or working, will migrate north into alabama to experience the mass extinction. they'll be either killed or washed off to the sea, scientists and environmentalists have said. and there have already been a couple sightings. but this is a really small mass extinction — it occurs during the migration phases of life, not the death phase. in other words, it's really not as massive as we think. usgs scientists published their news release wednesday in response to a question from cnn. ""this is also a massive–and it's premature to expect it to happen before the summer,"" said usgs conservator matt tancredo. ""our previous reports have highlighted some preliminary evidence that a life event will occur in the area and next year."" there's another reason why this particular piece of the river may go beyond due to the luck of the draw. a number of (albeit small) insects that are able to feed and move through it really attract some species to the river as they move north across alabama, texas and florida. these insects likely attract young, relatively young carnivores to the spot. you'd think these coyotes, for example, would find early indications that the cross-pollinating young do will not be able to survive. but don't take this news for granted. whether it's right, wrong or not, some of us are now free of these great invertebrates that are becoming extinct. so if this news doesn't make you rewound to ""the earth is cleaning up the corals,"" better start scouting for alternative sources for this post.",grover

134,"Sixth extinction: 20 years to stop ecological collapse sun valley, va. — for years, children's stuffed animals and youtube videos broadcast their murder and destruction in an effort to obliterate their habitats. yet images are fading for grainy snapshots of just what is left of the chesapeake and monroe counties, where people will not yet be aware that some of the massive wildlife and marshes that once grew to support dozens of grocery stores never grew, experts say. as a result, the farmers — especially those in parts of virginia and north carolina — will need to be devastated if they want to prosper, said paul jago, a program officer at the chesapeake bay foundation. with little reward in return, these little people became prime target for killers. from 2001 to 2009, more than 2,000 animal carcasses were seized from the owners of livestock farms, inter-cropped ""apcogenes,"" including deer, horses and birds, said ian chase, the washington water polo club's trainer, and a former navy seal. most of the carcasses that disappeared were documented on youtube. another 1,177 carcasses, containing 50 percent of the animal population, were seized from farms in montgomery county, virginia, and virginia, said yigal zipkin, a former wal-mart manager who also works for the chesapeake bay foundation. only about 30 percent of those killed were each mammal or marshes native to the region, zipkin said. ""there's no way to really capture wildlife like this,"" he said. voting kept the money coming back, siphoning it to air pollution mains, for many farms — about $100,000 in the last year, zipkin said. the resulting toxins produced in these woods and ditches, and and their accompanying ecosystems, have been tossed into the air and sent out to local rivers. over time, these toxins circulate in rivers and streams, triggering a feeding frenzy, according to the chesapeake bay foundation. most of the deaths in maryland, virginia and north carolina from april 18 to june 11 — before the 16th extinction on the chesapeake bay, a naturally occurring decline that began in the cascades of the chesapeake — occurred while leaving the region's mountains and streams in motion. the gunpowder, booms and wood smoke from several thousand pipe bombs placed over or around the chesapeake bay ""drove the mouths of would-be hunters,"" said robert jarrett, an environmental scientist at virginia commonwealth university and executive director of the chesapeake bay foundation. ""so if you're hunting with a truck, they see you and know what you are doing, and they have a look in their camera and say 'yeah, i know you're putting this stuff in the air,'"" jarrett said. voting for seashore farmland in virginia would help to house the animals, he said. the researchers wonder how the large, diversified wildlife will adapt to conditions in the river. ""it may be impactful, but it won't cut down on the number of lives we will save from that,"" jarrett said. federal regulators must decide how much to ban certain development in habitats like the chesapeake bay — already a thorny subject among farming communities. but charles nesting, an arborist at the chesapeake bay foundation, said the destruction that was underway doesn't have to be confined to animals. the law establishing the chesapeake bay foundation in 2001 requires more certainty on how to implement the law and use federal funds, said theresa o'leary, a natural resources policy analyst at the natural resources defense council. rural communities may be more likely to play by the rules, she said. ""often it's not you're going to get kids running around with fur or things because they want to eat something, they just want a food."" with animals stinking up the chesapeake bay, some think the destruction already has begun.

135,"How to stop the sixth mass extinction to avoid more extinction, you'll need to modify the way you take human land use and traffic, as well as your layout of cars and buses. the question is: how can humans fix traffic? in the agricultural and population-counting study released today, mit researchers analyzed the data, for example, of agricultural tractors and campers and used it to calculate the gross acres of land in states with more than one million residents, such as california, nebraska, oklahoma, idaho, wyoming, nevada, arizona, florida, virginia, kansas, connecticut, georgia, north carolina, delaware, south carolina, utah, kansas, tennessee, kentucky, louisiana, alabama, mississippi, ohio, pennsylvania, new hampshire, west virginia, oregon, south dakota, texas, tennessee, virginia tech, and washington. here's what they found: bicycle use costs the land. the parking paid for by the government or the local street parking fund is about $20,000 a year. that leaves a lot of towing on the roads. the vehicles are not regulated, but three-quarters of the goods hauled by the vehicle end up in trash carts that don't exist, the researchers said. traffic used to take so long that more street parking, more roads, and more cars equals more traffic. roadways on the urban highway are less congested. there are more alternate ways to travel. driver travel between and ends of schools makes extra room for emergency vehicles, who can haul the emergency vehicle on highways that are more congested. the government sort of drives each road, but there are restrictions, so they're ultimately counterproductive. keep wheels and tire pressure low. if you drive a car that weights its wheel, brakes and gears but is not properly maintained, people could have more of a problem for the trip. the researchers found that fewer brakes and so-called polyclan brakes will make a person slower on the road. paint is important. the communities that suffer the most from urban sprawl can be scenic or quiet, as long as it's done through the seasons. you could wind down the fantasy of living at the urban forest. land grows in cities without the help of technology or infrastructure. ""the best way to get rid of traffic is to remove all traffic from different urban centers in one place,"" steven murray, a professor at the california institute of technology, and lead author of the report, said in a news release. poor transport costs. water does not go to the ground in people or plants. developers and homeowners have used potable water in the last 30 years, but it's not an environmentally friendly solution. in many states, river and ocean waste is left in plastic bags. many utilities have turned their water into waste. take air. everyone from your children to that little angel in the front window of your house should be able to breathe air. drink an ounce of honey; a gallon of water is less than 400mg of pure nitrogen oxide. a gallon of green tea is not bad. food costs. the average price of a hot meal, out of context, can be as much as 100g. true, we are nearing a saturation point in the number of people with access to food and it's possible to roast certain meats, but avoiding meat and not poaching parts is not always going to make things better for us. 2. hunger drives the demise of cities. small towns are in need of more food and clothing, and much of them have no institutions with that kind of heavy equipment. feeding neighbors is important, but it's an old idea. consistency is more crucial than anything else. consider the water. every few years some place is set aside in a special place so you can grow a whole crop. the system of ""clean water"" for our health and the environment is like one large industrial plant in which a whole crop is watered for a few years and then cooked down. bad habits are things we need to change, and if we don't, we can't live and prosper in cities and grow healthier food. we are going to have more failures in cities because we don't have the infrastructure and machinery to thrive. the lesson is that everybody deserves better.",grover

""my mother was raped in a nursing home."" people will have the time to see teresa and heidi's books that i have covered, reading but just excitedly listening to the tapes, when the recordings had been shared across the world. i took this to mean that my mother's story should be allowed to be told again. teresa spent four years at a hospital. she died a few years later when, i know for sure, she fell ill. this is a story that was overlooked and ignored by journalists, policymakers and other experts. now, when someone writes about this in a reporter's article that has got published in a us magazine, the publication always points out that not everything is covered. earlier in the morning in family consultations: this is what they were told, it's an ethicist thing. that something happened. this is what we were told. this is what we would be given the opportunity to say in a story. but it's rare that someone in a story needs to talk about one thing more than another. they have to be willing to be honest. here is what i found when i was writing about teresa and heidi's stories in the new york times: their optimism, their vitality, their free spirit. when my granddaughter started to cry, i found their smiles and their ageless beauty. when the few children that are now living in the nursing home are going to find the healing power of therapeutic music in their lives. it's easy to let it go, young kids. you're in a nice place and you tell stories. that is the game changer. it's magical to me. you not only get life, you get life peace. that's why, why i am so fortunate.",grover
145,"Caregiver convicted of rape in nursing home (cnn) — a 68-year-old woman was found guilty of raping a 4-year-old girl in a nursing home in kentucky this year — marking one of the most significant legal cases in the u.s. since the sexual abuse of minors more than three decades ago was uncovered decades ago. the court case relates to a 2001 incident in which the victim was forced to perform sexual acts on another child she knew. the victim's attacker, 27-year-old bryan mccamey, ""entered the girl's home and performed sexual acts on her before sexually assaulting her,"" according to reports. mccally was convicted on thursday, a verdict that comes after a trial he oversaw for 18 months while working as an on-site caseworker at a kentucky home for retired and underemployed women. mccamey was in court for the verdict, but could not be reached. mccally will serve eight to 11 years in prison. his attorneys stated there was no basis for the conviction — the charges were later transferred to muskogee, oklahoma — and said he should serve his full term before being eligible for parole. he has had a nearly full prison term since he was arrested in 2013. the only victim who testified against mccamey was his girlfriend, who claims mccamey raped her while she was asleep, and she said she ""never wanted a sexual relationship with him,"" according to court documents. defense attorney harry j. horowitz praised the criminal justice system — saying, ""we have not been fazed."" ""the accused is a glorified adulterer and he has a right to not be angry at the judgement of his superior,"" horowitz said. last year, a judge ordered mccamey to pay $150,000 in restitution to the victims, one person at one of the scenes of sexual abuse. he was released on bail early friday morning. the case was especially challenging because the defense argued that mccamey was not aware of all the suffering that young girls suffered during their growing up in kentucky. he also admitted that he had been sexually abused — so he was not guilty. the case in arkansas involved a 32-year-old woman, who was sexually abused at a nursing home where mccamey was the caretaker. the abuse took place while he was working as a texas volunteer, the daily record newspaper in arkansas reported. it was there that mccamey sexually abused at least five other young women. the man who sexually abused the two women and the other survivor at the nursing home told investigators that he never tried to stop her from doing what he did. he admitted sexually abusing the other two, but denied that he suffered physically or psychologically from abuse. mccamey was ordered to pay about $150,000 to each of the victims. defense attorney heidi e. yuri told the court the jury likely heard a 60-second account from the survivor of mccamey raping her while she was sleeping in his bed. ""her story was crucial to the outcome,"" yuri said.",grover
146,"How artificial intelligence and robots can change your living spaces an innovative german company has developed a program that will automatically adjust heating and cooling systems to your homes' changing needs. marka, which has developed software that enables the visually impaired to give their physical dimensions and physiology, uses artificial intelligence (ai) to analyze a 3d printed artificial intelligence (ai) computer in order to more quickly adjust heating and cooling systems. if you are looking for a few things to do in your home, it's a good time to check your heating and cooling systems for a more realistic assessment. the program adjusts heating and cooling systems in order to aid in lighter lifestyles or more efficient living spaces. the majority of residential heating and cooling systems are based on a 3d printing technology, but ""almost all of the smart home components are based on 3d printers, meaning they rely less on robotics and ai, and therefore less on storage,"" marka founder shae german wrote in a recent report. the smart home systems made using technology created by marka may offer varying degrees of control for some scenarios, but they are designed for people who think humans won't respond well to situations or even mere measurements. the moving house has its challenges. ""modern living in germany is based on a one-size-fits-all approach, and since this approach involves asking the neighbors, your parents, pets, and neighbors for all the necessary information you can find in the surrounding area, you can use all of your sensors to give proper boundaries in order to get you moving faster and perhaps less easily."" the researchers ask all of your senses to step outside in order to neutralize alarms and alarms malfunction. to be clear, the reason not to use the robot more than three times a week is because the systems are too costly and fail to operate at optimal temperature. ""technically, the system is ready for use by trained agents in your home but the cost to improve it is highly expensive. this is a tradeoff for the degree of automation that we are willing to make and for the uncertainty that the technology that we are developing will create in our customers' lives,"" the researchers told npr. they say that modern platforms like ours have long needed better controls and interfaces that allow for more control than existing systems. automation will likely come sooner than expected, with many users finding their homes falling into the realm of larded with clothes dryers or utility outlets that need to be opened, but most home and office systems will not be moved quickly if these problems surface. ""the two major problems we face in the current life-ecosystem: the growing disposable income and older adults, and the need for the computing power that has enabled many of the homes built decades ago,"" german wrote. ""in addition, we are still living in a world where we can't always have an answer to these problems. this is because we know what it is not to be forced to spend money, that we really need to learn about change, and by having an awareness of what it is not like to be asked to choose, we can move forward in reducing traffic and installing more electronic devices.""",grover

154,"Where Trump support and Obamacare use soar washington (cnn) — donald trump clearly views the republican party as ""crazy"" because of obamacare, a fact that is becoming increasingly obvious in polling, according to a new poll released tuesday. the upward trend that has developed over the last week is no surprise to anyone who has ever spent time on the couch with a polling staff, especially after holding a polling desk job for president obama for two years, and hours of draining away each new poll. in a recent poll taken march 22-26, 85% of likely voters said they now have a favorable opinion of the gop, compared to a recent 15% approval rating, a non-partisan finding that is consistent with a basic polarization of beliefs between the country's two major political parties, according to a poll released monday by acorn. more than two-thirds said their views of the republican party are being ""honest and trustworthy,"" compared to just 49% who said they were in the opposition. indeed, whatever one views as ""crazy"" are less associated with trump than with others, except for the famous quote: ""if you gave them a telephone poll, they'd be like your mother!"" more importantly, after trump and john mccain's fortunes waned in early 2014, the republican party completely took over the republican national committee's executive committee structure. and if the numbers continue to improve as they have since march 22, those power players can easily adapt. according to the political consulting firm stratfor, republicans now have 60% of the newly elected members, even though they were expected to change their messaging, and only 37% of those members are republicans. and, by far, most of the new members are moderates. ""the fate of the republican party as we know it today depends in large part on the size of their organization,"" linda sanchez, chairman of the republican national committee, said in a statement monday. ""all eyes are on the party in our most important and targeted state now, and all signs point to a new washington party that can win elections in november."" according to the stratfor poll, the most popular gop side of the nation was formed in february to begin consolidating its leadership following president obama's ascendance. among the most popular gop candidates was republican sen. ted cruz of texas, who, according to a poll released on monday, now has a 42% chance of winning the party's nomination. like cruz, perry topped in the rankings on the right, while former alabama gov. haley barbour, tennessee sen. dan coats, and former alaska gov. sarah palin shared five or more chances of winning. the fact that each of the new committee members are more liberal than the two previous four and a half months with which they ran the party is particularly shocking, and highlights the fact that both have already experienced slumps of their own making. still, the official question in polling is whether the next four months will be a bruising month for the party. if the republican party is poised to grow in popularity, republicans will no doubt take advantage, but both parties will have to work to convince voters they can still summon the will to go forward if they want to keep sweeping into the next election cycle. the bottom line, though, is the republican party needs to look beyond its republican party base.",grover

162,"Get ready for a more militant and 'woke' NAACP yesterday i posted the previously planned segment on the black lives matter movement at the new york times, and it caught my attention: black lives matter supporters -- and other folks -- are intent on a radical new right-wing movement, now that the democratic party is in the majority in the white house. let's go a little closer, shall we? about that ""woke"" movement black lives matter activists based in savannah, georgia, have a strong, unofficial agenda, but their ability to get things done is limited. they do not need the internet and public television to scuttle the agenda. during the last presidential race, african-americans voted twice to make it easier for white-collar murder cases to be prosecuted. they also went so far as to write for the new york times that ""every political race you can think of has at least one black prominent congressional occupant,"" which is why most white republicans don't really understand the democratic party. for those in the media, the most common argument is that blacks in the democratic party -- as a group -- are soft on crime and violence, and have little concern about attacks on black people. while white journalists have often criticized the ""woke"" movement, they, like the black people in savannah, have no problem with a new right-wing movement. in fact, this led one newspaper photographer, kevin liles, to know some facts. it is a hard way to build a bipartisan movement. ""if you want to draw a line, my goodness,"" he said, ""you've got to start somewhere. if the black lives matter movement is going to bring you a group with a black face, that's something you can do."" the reason to not sign up for an edge groups like apa is that apa -- the movement that is now the democratic resistance movement, led by george wallace -- wouldn't allow for bsa (bide your hat, marinate your spirit), so they aren't going to get involved with political events.

164,"When exorcists need help, they call him family therapy association of utah (freelake) is hosting a free seminar for the entire family to share their thoughts on traditional catechism, non-medical techniques, and their healing techniques for difficult situations. this year's seminar is the first time audiences, families, and therapists will be able to join in on the discussion and take the discussion all on themselves. there are some limits to the amount of debate to be in. so how do they plan on explaining all the differences between the ancient world and modern japan? from the psychology of catechism: in japan, the practitioner is a reputable person with special skills in research, home relations, and age. this person's sense of inclusion and critical need to rebuild their faith have a place in the family as they try to cope with the harshness of contemporary society. this individual creates a protective mechanism of instinctive fear and vulnerability, with clear expectations of one another to become the next heaven child. whereas in the ancient world, the person has strict social norms, the person remains rigid, an angry and negative person, who only tries to say something concerning to others because this becomes his own way of coping with life. as an example, mika kaplan explains that when a man is supposed to be supportive of his children, they have no thought of him as an older man when that person is supposed to be physically, mentally, emotionally. this person's problem is that he does not understand the situation, which makes it difficult for him to express anything considered negative. catechism: while modern catechism professionals have emphasized proper catechism practice, in practice, there has been little research to support the practice. this assumption should be implemented immediately, as catechism is the only way to truly know how the body functions, and it must be done in a responsible manner. this has resulted in many failures to test the healing processes as we know them. the premise of catechism is that a person needs to reframe their perception of life to help them understand their role as a parent. while therapy works to help a person understand the negative aspects of everyday life, non-medical techniques can help the individual learn to cope with the tension of our surrounding society. this article discusses the positive, and troublesome, elements of catechism that might be useful to parents. for example, families can also utilize the procedure of a non-medical counselor. what if there is someone who has a problem with their child and wants to advise them on how to cope with the situation? this person can also be explained to by making an offer to speak with him or her: a counselor can help the child learn things he or she can't, especially as the main focus of therapy. the counselor can request that this child also attend a ""family"" orientation session, a time to heal the child's grief. this is a time to ask how the child handled the situation, and to talk about how they have learned to deal with one another. if you want to receive additional information and resources for your family therapy experience, please reach out to rob schneider, ccta president and ceo, at 2502-338-1111 and rob.scc@cctaan.com. note to editors: the topics covered in the seminar, which are not included on the website, are listed on this website and are available to a range of people from different backgrounds. for more information on this topic and how you can contribute on the website, please call me at the ccta office (515) 30000 or go to www.cctaan.com.",grover

(they can't be extended to alcohol.) if these laws work, why not expand them further? more than half of those polled in 2011 by gallup, which provides gun control research, said they'd use more of their guns for hunting, fishing, or any sport, compared with just 20% who didn't. and it's a trend. gun owners continue to run the country, pearce said, and look for practical ways to safeguard their interests. this summer, uni will launch its gun control web site. there's a similar site with options including online registration. the service has such safeguards as limiting straw purchases and notifying participants of the lifetime risk of carrying a gun. meanwhile, the new hampshire association of gun owners will use the gun control internet to reach its readers, according to the anga. get similar tips for getting a good shot. ""they sell them all,"" pearce told me last month. still, weapons are a weapon, and we must take them seriously in other ways. our neighbors to the north, for example, use more guns than we do. men with guns have doubled their physical assets since 2006, according to an estimate in the frank miller book, ""the guns war."" but the reasons for the increase are largely semantic: men are not very territorial, as do women; women as use of guns have been relatively stable, and men do a lot of hunting and fishing. but if you want to defend yourself, you need a gun, too.

167,"25 of the most iconic photographs why do you see such icons? you give me a poster on the stairs of a building and i think of one who exists on the other wall. my mom used to work in construction and i grew up in a big house with only four adults, which i am still present to this day. because of my mother's voice and my career, i think of the writer elizabeth gilbert. she had a brilliant mind and a cool one. however, a time can't be too far off from now. just two years ago, i was at night while on assignment at the smithsonian's national museum of african american history and culture when i was covering a story about jamie oliver, chef of the oliver queens-run oliver's kitchen. naturally, oliver was on the scene and we were listening to a podcast, which was a pretty rude show from any journalist. it was one of those you wake up from a really bad dream and go running and say, i'm sitting down, like, la presciently, an emotional sort of jail break, and then everything kind of takes me back to the hotel and the rest is history. i stayed there, i saw jamie oliver eating supper in an elevator and i sat there, reading the contents of the paper, absorbing the composition, and i thought, well, ok, this is odd and i'm not sure i want to talk about it. i was working on the blog. i was going to be there for one day, so i was going to be sat there and read the contents. i was working a site called the reader, about the history of the memoir and wrote a piece on the blog for the piece, and i thought i'd read it and i would show it to people. we had a video show, and it was like, something needs to happen, and in that moment, we stood there and said, ""of course, we need to talk about it."" it wasn't a chore at all, it was just really exciting. of course, it really wasn't something i saw every day. but this moment had given me a new outlet to really be who i am, which was getting to know jamie oliver and the extraordinary people he was going to feed himself for the rest of his life. you make an acquaintance, and it's hard. this is the way you are supposed to be. the person you are meeting and hearing and feeling this and feeling this is different from whatever it is that you are experiencing, and i have not seen anything like that in my life, and it's always been such a privilege to have been a part of such a relationship, which was part of my experience at school, all of the things that i need to do if i'm going to be interested in anything. and so i kept learning. i love going to museums, listening to cultural history. sometimes you do that, sometimes you do that and you spend a lot of time interacting with these people and being like, i know that he's amazing, but the thing is, and i hope people like him can find his passions, will find the passion, and those passions can feed off of him. and the thing about ""the reader"", which feels like it came at the right time, is that i was pretty young, and in middle school, it was hard. people were saying this is impossible, this is impossible. we were thinking, how can we fix it? you can't. there are different avenues, and if you want to change the trajectory and change the belief system then there is no reason to change anything. i was lucky. i have so many wonderful relationships with people.",grover

173,"Up close in the brutal world of a female fight club by susan french when the lead dancer in a club, the men, choose who they will attack. just a few examples, here are the 18 men and women who have voluntarily partied with giant girls at a local strip club. but how are the women's choices based? because their breasts are too small to stab on the men, the male dancers' choices can only go so far. so when it comes to the male dancer, his decision is often (somewhat) about size. or he just prefers his roles more liberally weighted so that his physical size matches his sexual orientation. more than any factor, sex plays an important part in how men choose female dancers. in 1974, the league of women's bowling associations (lwba) had a list of the chief tasks for its forthcoming class of 50 female/female (male) contestmasters. the three categories of the newly-formed club were character, athletic support and ideological representation. each category was then divided into four classes to match the coaches' first preferences. it turns out that the campers with no sexual orientation or makeup were more than suitable for each category. the group faced a host of challenges. one of them was limiting exhibitionism, where fun was aimed. the skills involved involved men being too naked, making infanticide look less likely, and affecting our sexual orientation. with the women and men equally judged, one could guess that their desires were one size fits all. a female battle club would also have difficulty challenging competition. then there was the question of who the sexes were sexually than the other teams. in 1967, the league of women's bowling associations took its first steps into the female contest arena with its first group of female bambuses. at its first meeting in 1960, the international association of bambuses and matches for women (iatw) said it would concentrate on a group of adult 12-year-olds, whether they wanted to be in a more ""healthy"" position. in 1970, iatw's retirement board accepted the recommendation of a new board of bambuses; in 1974, the following year, the divisional tourism board (dhb) approved the formation of a bambuses federation, which was later made into the association of bambuses and matches. but the position of female bambuses has evolved quite a bit. it was at dhb's 75th anniversary convention in 1988 that racist richard richard, chairman of the board of directors, proposed the creation of the abaas women bambuses. it is unclear if the issue came up at the convention. today, bambuses is a much bigger, more frequented group of women than the still-formal women bambuses. so, should the bambuses show signs of disowning their power? or should the dancing girls really be revved up about what qualities they want to bring to the contest? in the spirit of the ""we all work together,"" we suggest the following simple ideas for men's teams and women's bambuses to provide for a smooth tournament. 1. look for the men. you can ""run up"" each judge with their individual actions. don't be surprised if two-thirds of the time, they are running around in their scrubs looking for something. 2. look for the men. you can ""run up"" the size of an men's bambus or anyone else that looks like that. only men can fire him away with these skills, and by weight, not sexuality. 3. generate the men as inspirations. follow their winning tumbles every time. show them the power of the men and do not send them the ""get out of the way"" ogles of any females. 4. compete for ""spends you time too much of your time and time of desire"" rather than more or less. this is some of the best and most important choices we have made. 5. make your own judgments. certain groups like bambuses and bambuses form the very body of each group. they expect to win. no women. 6. don't confuse the sexes. just because these two groups are like the males doesn't mean they are alike in any way. it would be good if every male and female bambuses in each grouping heard some entertaining opinions regarding its attributes.",grover

(it gets worse.) and yet, there's so much evidence that feminism is currently in full swing, primarily from the original unarguable (albeit subpar) kind that it was spawned in the early 1970s. this isn't a new idea, by any means. in fact, some feminist historiography tends to come up with a few precedents for the term. harry ford thought up the idea of the feminist chicken shop in allentown, pennsylvania. he went on to invent the ""gogo 'the beers' chain"". others, such as stephen colbert, whose bad nagging obsession about tv chefs' kitchens become a fixture on colbert's nightly comedy program colbert report, is the perfect example of the kind of manhole bit that every late-night host pretends he's on at all. their archaic ways of objectifying women would hardly look out of place in a pre-trump era, where everyone likes a woman. in this case, no one is going to stand for it, just as they did against voting rights and their civic activism. • it's an insightful analysis, uncluttered by the usual blather and blubbering, that none of us can quite get over we need a woman to never be underrepresented in our institutions, even though we are still a minority group. what is worse — now that we know that everyone is secretly a bigot — than a woman being underrepresented? i recently wrote about the notion that we have sexual relations between men and women but are so misguided about where we're going that it's useless to talk about the immorality and prejudices among our men. i think it is the best-written material on what it means to be the person you want to be. for one thing, it's about the sheer weight of the experience of being a woman and also about the odds it could have ever happened. it also suggests that feminism does indeed have sex. female justices need not know what they want to do but are armed with educated judges in an unfortunate feminist utopia: rape is wrong, but it's ok. it is intelligent, nor should they fail to earn the high honor of women. (not because it seems perfectly ""american"", though, because not everyone likes their patriarchal ways any more. ""american"" could get caught speaking of what they did or whatever. understating even an ""american"" is half the battle.) just like with sexual assault and sex discrimination. allyson wong is the author of ""there's something going on: inside the politics of victimhood"" (penguin, 2018) and a senior fellow at the university of virginia",grover
179,"Sources: Disabled work program mired in fraud security clearouts at tuesday's u.s. labor department elections stand out as evidence of multibillion-dollar fraud. nearly 1,000 employees are claiming work permits issued by the multi-care work program office (mlwpo) just before the election in every state except for california. the u.s. treasury department is holding a closed-door hearing monday to determine how much money that program actually siphoned from taxpayers to cover claims in about 2,700 of those cases. federal officials said the $700 million in alleged voter fraud this election season dates back to october 2014, when legislators in california briefly postponed a ballot measure that would have allowed states to take over a federal program. they said republicans had used the program illegally. federal officials have worked from the beginning to catch fraud here. in california, texas, nevada, iowa, michigan, illinois, new jersey, ohio, vermont, new york, oregon, west virginia, pennsylvania, massachusetts, new mexico, new york, north carolina, and wisconsin, which are run by the u.s. department of labor. federal officials allege that about 230 of the 3,400 claims were fraudulent and there was a little more than $250 million in the fraud. the goal of investigations is for victims to come forward and help prevent a repeat of such cases. secretary of labor sally jewell told congressional staffers monday that those fraud claims were handled ""appropriately."" her department has received numerous emails, so far. but she told lawmakers that ""we believe that as the result of accounting for 'voter fraud,' legitimate michigan and california claims had been processed and issued through noncompliant means."" federal officials said reports of fraudulent work permit applications filed at the wisconsin bureau of motor vehicles were consistent with those made by workers at the dhs office in oakwood. davis efsinger, executive director of the bipartisan michigan citizens against government waste, a watchdog group, said that auditors from the dhs agency said that out of the 1,500 (about one-third) allegations, about 44 percent contained all the claims that were submitted before the election. he said that the texas case is among the many such cases. it was not clear how many of the claims were the product of the dhs fraud. the u.s. department of labor would not confirm or deny a report that stated only 19 workers had been arrested at the agency for filing false claims. the department estimates that the program was targeted at taxpayers seeking information about voting rights. a u.s. department of labor spokesperson said the agency had no role in the u.s. voter verification process. but labor rights groups, including afl-cio, used a different strategy. a dispute over the alleged voter fraud at the department of labor has forced dol to cancel thursday's scheduled election in missouri's 2nd congressional district.",grover

""one possibility is that in the event that a certain group of people have contacted the irs, we will write a letter at that time to ask them to take matters into their own hands,"" smith said. taxpayers are split between taxpayers who act on advance claims, rather than taking the personal actions needed to file for an irs filing.

""if it's multiple people of various ethnicities who have contributions to go toward that hospital, which is this in the u.s., or it's multiple localities, the odds of going bankrupt go up enormously,"" schonfeld said. and irs delays that, schonfeld said, may force them to rely on fraud experts with advice about using information from the internet for their intended tax return or passover. ""you don't want to rush into someone else's account. one of the ways you can do that is to get a tax form filled out, submit it online and process it,"" schonfeld said. be prepared urgent calls to the irs help are being dropped from hundreds of different calling centers this week, the irs said.",grover

189,"The truth about the white working class by natalia reyes and kate gavin we are under the gun to demonstrate at the beijing olympic closing ceremony how the so-called white working class has been linked to a significant influence on politics. after all, the wh has always been the campaign to give the elite a voice in the debate of american politics. and to do this in a predominately white race that has historically been resistant to promoting its own voice, has come across as an encouraging project of corporate america. it does not make a difference how this so-called ""white working class"" has come to be portrayed to the nation. the white working class that we have been talking about for years is largely composed of white progressives whose battle to oppose the tea party (in the large cities, what many call the ""mockery of america"") was perceived to be as a rejection of white middle-class middle-class voting patterns, labor quotas, and small business policies. as such, these were the foundations of the tea party insurgency, but not because the party had now turned off traditional voting patterns. but the problem in this economic climate has to do with its increasingly small states, because like the land of the open road in california, they have few commercial landowners or jobs available to provide for their populations. three small states — arizona, colorado, and nevada — now have such huge middle-class populations. they are the most populous of the large states, and the fourth-largest in the nation. at approximately 14 million, these states are roughly 16% of the nation's population, if you include a very small population of hispanics. but while the white working class stands shoulder to shoulder with these states, it is the massive concentration of white racial elites, from the reagan-like ""top of the hill"" era, along with their small and medium-sized majority black/latino population, that are claiming power to western capitalist nations, while the lone white working class is becoming a menace to american capitalist democracy. they do so using socialized medicine, and the price of their natural resources is higher-income jobs and a national debt which has been swollen by white wealth. the point of this country, at least insofar as it is involved in this nation's economy, is not that its interests should prevail over the interests of whites. what concerns it in this decision was that the most directly affected and affected by the #metoo movement, under the auspices of the republican party in america, is a perception by white liberals of societal evil, i.e., a recognition that the culture and ways that facilitated systemic racism have not been challenged; and it is completely unacceptable for people, who are considered irrelevant and insignificant in the lives of white people, to be denied the same equal rights as everyone else. it is understandable that many whites are waiting, and, in many cases, willing, and able to respond, if victims of sexual abuse by their employers, lies and teachings on the internet, and one thing they can expect is justice, but there are no excuses for past injustices and reprehensible practices, or the ugliness of political discourse. but racism, in a pluralistic society like ours, takes on extraordinary levels, and is totally out of touch with the american way of living. we can go on to prove beyond doubt that the ancient guilt at the original white working class, through the misrepresentation of its culture and beliefs, is capable of reinventing itself in a healthy manner to meet the local needs of its population. the philosophy of wallace r. perkins — ""have one law. but have two."" — can help usher in this new age. our collective culture, and the economy, is finding itself in the midst of something more significant.",grover

""when it comes to the practical issues of race, housing, identity, sexual identity, sexual orientation and sexual orientation, those concerns loom large in areas as diverse as immigration, safety, property rights, job protection, preserving educational opportunities and defending social security,"" according to the report. the survey was conducted feb. 4-8 among 2,017 adults nationwide, aged 18 to 64. the margin of error for the survey is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. the report reveals a divide among evangelicals, a gop demographic whose core vote lines up strongly with trump and evangelicals, where these groups account for 41% of gop support. the survey had an immediate impact: since 1980, when polls first began tracking the gender identity and sexual orientation of american women, the prevalence of sexual orientation at a young age among evangelicals has risen dramatically. this pattern shows just how deep the divide is between republican evangelicals who are committed to god's message and those who are disturbed by it. the survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. ""so what is this shift into behavior that is seen across all of the groups? more distrustful of the political process,"" said nikole wright, associate director of the pew research center's center for the study of faith in america. ""and also one of the consequences of that so-called 'disinformation"" in this polarized culture is a fear of disagreeing with donald trump."" roughly six out of every 10 evangelicals feel the same way as trump about faith and democracy. in a two-way conversation, 77% of republicans and 85% of democrats agree with trump on the economy, according to the survey. less than two-thirds of republican voters see the economy as negative. the pew research center report explores areas of the public's concern about religious liberty, funding the health care system, defending social safety net and personal freedom. the report also interviews experts in religious liberty and civil liberties to examine options for holding public officials accountable in a variety of ways. that includes actions such as rescinding a lifting of federal support for a program that suppresses forced abortions or extending government assistance to those without health insurance. the report also explores whether the political process is driving a wedge between those who believe in god's message and those who are worried about religious liberty. in january, the pew research found that trump's supporters viewed the concept of religious liberty as ""pretty much consistent with today's values in this country. but they don't fully understand why it's failing,"" laura l. hart, director of the pomerantz law school center on faith and liberty, said in a statement.

193,"West Virginia's 'forgotten tribe'; why the white working class feels left behind there is plenty of talk about people who live in the ""forgotten tribe"" from the centuries-old notion that the white working class ""offers the welfare of the majority of those in the country."" is there a working class problem with these conversations? at an intersection of local historical monuments, e-mail lines and e-verification devices, black homes with old west painted exterior doors and farmsteads with farmhouse, spotted trees and caravans, mules and cattle roam the west. when and how we try to tell the story are left to history. to get it right, we need a bit of archaeology and a bit of optimism. we need a bit of hope. a walking tour of the abandoned rural villages below the cow stands is one way to understand the action here. it was not long ago that not a stone was left to hiss on old west cattle trade sites. the valley is where there once were several hundred millisieverts running around the conrail railway named 'the can farm' that connected hermits and colonists. old west cattle traded journey back and forth for generations, from the farmhouse to the railroad. finding the spot where one of your own grandmother smoked a delicious el chapo cigar at a tourist dinner before heading to work, reading his diary and planning an escape can be the most rewarding part of the journey. the trip would not be complete without a visit to west virginia. for a first, we would fly over mount airy national monument from jefferson barracks, at the pay $55 per person, and settle at the ""p.o. box"" located at 2806 cambridge pike. the nearest stop is at chicopee state park, at 210 n. main st. john's suggestion would be a wireless transmitter that soaks in foliage and provides dry, textured soil for tots to hoe along. the transmitter would also use chemicals to produce harsh air for the white working class, and utilize both emts and army medical teams. one main problem is that those working hard are not seen through mountains. the lack of treatment for treating injuries and limited treatment for white working class diseases has been a source of contention for years, but one solution is born of individual projects. for instance, governor tommy thompson's private wv white & sons private-based job training company is helping white working class families through more than 150 construction and painting jobs. wv red and war of 1812 buildings in the town run by high-management m.d. duke and ""old black"" missionaries run on bare-bones wooden floors and candle poles and canopies. the civil war was even fought with antique equipment that could never fit under a brick wall. in 1808, brone brothers company erected a mount rushmore monument on much of jamestown after sending students out to show how to build upon their home base. the place was still home to part of the rural colorado descendants that also helped put west virginia on the map. our tour arrived late and faded from memory, but we'd seen many different things to where these really first came from. a locomotive and wagon rumbling down the steep hillside called the conrail route. as an old wv information server that was made up of often-troubled local archival materials, its destruction created an instant reputation for blight, where credit cards and insurance were stolen or driven out of use. voila! the wrong idea of leaving rural america has long since been forgotten. the remaining useful remnants of power, administration and the easy access of commerce have helped turn back the power of the white working class. conrail was built to link remote communities by rail, and it remains in service today. however, we can't leave things like the barns and houses that lie vacant now, or the uninvited pickup trucks and pick-up trucks whose inhabitants ride the rails and drive away from the town center. to prevent a return to all-white supremacy we must properly evaluate what was done when the efforts of our heroic settlers to exterminate the working class were finally met with the aid of the men and women in black and white shirts. the process is brutal. growing young and young men slip into militias and join forces with fellow laborers who encourage white working class politics. our schoolchildren and our brave last few years, especially veterans and their fathers, come to a shocking conclusion: we're not going to bring the past home to those who fought to free it from the grip of centuries-old bigotry. however, in the very near future, no one can pretend that west virginia is no more for workless farmers than it was the 1850s. until we put people's lives",grover

""the american working class is still growing from here,"" said james lopez, president of the civic alliance, which advocates immigration reform. ""we hope we can get this conversation right."" among hispanic americans, the poll found the report was essentially unchanged. even among whites, 57 percent of hispanics said immigrants contributed to a modern-day society, compared to just 40 percent who said they contributed to a modern-day society. regarding personal views on immigration, just 13 percent of americans said they felt some degree of effect on their personal lives, compared to 71 percent who felt an effect on their overall life. even among people with a high school diploma, 45 percent said immigrants changed their lives, compared to 51 percent who said so. trying to achieve a satisfactory living standard for americans in all social and economic categories could be just as hard for immigrants as for white americans. fewer than a third of whites say their personal lives improved within five years, compared to 80 percent of whites.",grover

""the new administration is setting the total modern world wage for the pt,"" her party described its recent presidency in brazil's workers' party media guide. rousseff called on people to buy beef because her policies could save the economy from years of cheap prices: ""cattle stands to be a new nightmare to live with,"" she said in a recent news release. rousseff's people's money were tight and she badly wanted to boost exports of grains and chemicals to central asia and the middle east, which also produces dried grain. but things did not work out. by selling scrap together few profitable parts of the process, they also bought feedlots that avoided laying hundreds of thousands of small operations to save themselves. by the end of the year, they stood to make 70% to 80% less of the $3 billion they invested. the fact that cattle were so scarce doesn't mean the issue is hopeless. when purchasing cattle is an exercise in cheap labour, people get to enjoy it — and it's part of a good overall social and economic strategy for the post-brazil kick-off. when it's already a real and present problem — like the usual men and women out, rich and poor — people can work themselves back into the game. sluggish prices could allow the pt to avoid such problems and steer the country in the right direction. read more: mexico's cinco de mayo tribute: why mexico's elites are too rich",grover

""i think it is going to happen, we are going to make the decisions,"" he said. ""the sooner it gets to that point, the sooner we can get there, because we have some good consensus in these discussions."" bolton, who was warmly welcomed by both the former foreign secretary boris johnson, and eu vice-leader amadou diallo, seemed more relaxed than he had been in weeks. he said that it was not that different from brexit talks with the u.s. at the beginning of the year. ""what is more interesting is that there is a good consensus on the way forward,"" he said. ""there has been some tentative progress on this front over the past few days."" bolton stressed that the u.s. was committed to working together to secure a deal, following the irish border issue which could lead to the use of force if britain was unable to leave the european union. however, the vice-president also said that the ""durable confidence we feel would be about a no-deal"" brexit and that the eu must ultimately agree to keep open the possibility of limited divorce talks as the irish border issues were clarified by government officials. ""it is very much going to be up to the british government to decide what we do on the ground tomorrow and when we do get there to deliver on the real concrete brexit terms that we gave them in our negotiations,"" he said. british prime minister theresa may signaled no new talks on the irish border if her government faced a no-deal brexit, but signaled that such talks might be revived if there was a release date. bolton said the question was whether the deal ""meets the lowest possible standard"" - one he saw as precedent for a no-deal – at a meeting with may and her team. ""if there was a few years off, i doubt what the period would be like with a 30-year brexit,"" he said. bolton added that he thought he was seeing more ""verbal decision-making in the job"" than before the end of january when european council president donald tusk suspended talks and threatened to impose the 15-nation bloc's laws, partly in response to may's disastrous divorce bill. even if there is still a ""good consensus"", bolton said, it is ""a very disconcerting thing.""",grover

""it is easy for small cases to get trolled,"" murphy said.

""we had the opportunity to break the taboo of the male and female splits and get justice for others who are less fortunate,"" collins said. ""the reason why divorce proceedings can be relatively unsound is because people generally don't believe in divorce."" collins said lots of women's and men's customers watched the video, a rare selling point for online video-sharing sites such as twitch. murphy said that although some people watching a video of divorce proceedings could potentially be recorded on their phones, it is an opportunity to change the way they approach matters. ""it's such a taboo subject,"" murphy said. ""often, divorce litigation can't be broadcast so that conversation turns into publicity."" legislation to regulate the livestreaming of divorce proceedings will go before the department of justice soon, he said. careful tracking of 'slaves' online dismissing broadcasters, collins says, is not an uncommon request in the u.k. some 660 million people, on average, watched a video of divorce proceedings in 2018, he said. lee stewart, who created a website for livestreaming divorce proceedings and created a video piece to help people track their videos, said it ""would be nice to change the story of divorce."" it's important ""to understand that (redacted) broadcasts and performance codes need to be changed so this doesn't have to be a taboo subject,"" stewart said. collins said publicizing the legal age of consent in divorce proceedings can help people get a better impression of the two sides. ""the awkwardness of 'spending your weekend laying on a mattress and trying to get some kind of financial return is no longer acceptable,"" murphy said. ""it's so unaccepted that some people may, in some cases, prefer to just watch one person complaining that they might not get to spend the money they wanted."" unlike their counterparts in the u.s., where divorce proceedings are not commonly heard on television, americans generally feel they are being heard, with jones v. martin herce (2013) that became the united states' first televised motion picture to take in the case. ""forget (france) about black women saying 'i'm so sad that god didn't send us to prison,'"" collins said. ""i think the u.s. government is evolving its stance on issues of justice and equality."" the law enforcement interception plan for the united states and britain has produced a guiding text for the use of livestreaming in divorce proceedings in several countries. while such services often are free to stream on facebook, twitch host erin kerr said allowing people to provide feedback to publicists, lawyers, police and judges about the outcomes of the most pressing legal issues or their roles is important.

231,"How do you beat high-flying Liverpool? Watford's Christian Kabasele reveals all this book by niall quinn focuses on three dominant players from a pre-season europa league team: mesut ozil, lucas leiva and christian kabasele. quinn describes them as ""two of the sport's heavyweight champions"" and is hard on themselves ""to come up with fundamentals and structure that will never go out of style."" not just any champions! united's kabasele boasts a personal record of 35 goals in 27 games for arsenal and 22 more for german club arsenal, while each of those four has his own form of execution – his saves don't come more than 20 times a season. his ability to negate the ball when he has the opportunity is an imperative for arsenal -- although the average score in english league one is 79 (while germany is an astonishing 22). kabasele's contribution to the team's success, however, is so impressive it's become a prized asset for the man nicknamed the ""tractor boys"". english football's five highest-paid players are no stranger to this, but the gathering of players chosen to represent the biggest clubs was a lengthy process. wenger selected ozil, who the gunners earned last season's champions league player of the year, with the homegrown boy himself, edinson cavani. kabasele may not have even been in the team at that stage but the seven-time european cup winners have risen above the pack - doing so through their uncanny ability to equalise without leaving the box. for their efforts he has been taken all over the football world, from mesut ozil to leeds united's jurgen klopp to france's dirk kuyt. ""christian kabasele has taken three top-10 men in a couple of years to turn the world's best defensive duo into their country's biggest one-two punch,"" quinn writes. it's no secret that the belgian is a master at baroque passing, with the goal machine breaking passes in as they creep over the opposition. wenger believes players such as kabasele and kabasele bring the utmost respect to the business of the game and spend some time here with his players before committing themselves to either a club or country. the same applies for the argentinian duo either too well-fed for their livelihood or too badly fried up for competition. for kabasele and kabasele however, much to the delight of arsenal fans, the international find allows him to truly excel at football in his spare time. he's into his first campaign and has already doubled arsenal's goal difference. quinn suggests arsenal's defending in the premier league is a remarkable combination, with the centre brugge outfit recording a 4-0 win over liverpool earlier this season, prompting the likes of manager arsene wenger to cheer on his star. given the hardship found in the premier league and champions league, the man city head coach admits that the sheer fear of unfamiliarity with football suits him. ""people say this all the time, but i never understood why i was dreaming of (the champions league) until i had worked so hard. i never thought about how i'd feel if i were anywhere in that bracket, if i didn't get home to sheffield wednesday at the top of my leagues, what would i be able to do? i never understood how much it would be to win the trophy when you're in a special place. it was an extraordinary feeling to get the results,"" said kabasele after the city game. he is not the only arsenal fan to this week tackle kabasele. luka modric, the spurs man, was subjected to the 'massive rivalry' after he labelled the gunners' defensive frailties ""unacceptable"". he went on to say that success at the highest level will not be enough to do damage to football in england. ""the derby is an opportunity for players not to win, not for managers. their best will be the to win the league cup, champions league, so no matter how bad the league is, these guys will be winners.

232,"Airlines extend waivers, adjust schedules for Europe travel ban by lynne roorda washington, april 5 (reuters) - airlines extended travel restrictions on wednesday as the united states supreme court granted final, but no final, rulings on the travel ban, sending a mixed message to travelers seeking exit permits. the supreme court gave final rulings on a case on the legality of president donald trump's directive allowing restricted foreign travel to people from seven predominantly muslim countries and which was challenged by state attorneys general. the decisions followed a ruling on tuesday by the 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals in washington, which said the travel ban should stand pending a ruling from the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals in new york. the ruling covered cases against airlines and airports nationwide that had argued that the travel ban was constitutional because americans are allowed to travel to the united states under the immigration and nationality act of 2000. monday's ruling was issued after earlier challenges to the travel ban had been filed in federal courts in 18 states. trump's directive affected travelers from seven muslim-majority countries and banned them from entering the united states unless they were a candidate for citizenship or family that is not related to a particular country. trump wants to build a massive wall along the u.s.-mexico border and to deport more than 1 million undocumented immigrants whose immigration violations are being prosecuted at the border. in a letter to congressional lawmakers, he urged lawmakers to ""restore the rule of law,"" and last week he opened what he termed a ""politically motivated"" investigation into alleged voter-suppression attempts by his opponents. trump's order bans travel to the united states by most nationals of seven mostly muslim countries and barring all muslims from entering the country. the travelers are mainly sudanese, saudi arabia, afghanistan, iraq, syria, libya, somalia, sudan and yemen. the lawsuits filed by those countries over the travel ban stand pending a higher court ruling, and it is unclear when the appeals court will hear the case or whether it will grant final rulings on the travel ban. the review process has been highly complicated by challenges to trump's authority under the constitution. congress has no power to overturn the president's order by law. but the trump administration already had applied for expedited review under the special immigration judge mandated to weigh the president's options before issuing a travel ban. congress granted some relief to travel to the united states by halting most class action lawsuits that had sought travel ban relief.",grover

""we have been inundated with requests from people on the united states side for what we call seasonal hassle, this problem where travellers see a terminal or a security check as they come in,"" chief official florentijn hofmann of the europol, the european law enforcement agency tasked with enforcing european laws, told cnn on friday. hofmann added that a coordinated, local crackdown would ""enhance the integration of customs and law enforcement at the borders"". the eu's christmas holiday has generally opened days later, much like the u.s. government tries to advance its nation-wide travel agenda — only it's not going to be as seamless. three countries introduced ""fake"" passports to gain access to the united states via the uk in july. a german official in charge of sending financial and logistical goods to germany, the netherlands and the united kingdom pointed to a uk decision to abolish all fake passports as a factor that could potentially leave all citizens in the uk in violation of the trade laws. once it becomes law, the use of digital identities or digital-only passports will all disappear, he added. the german government had to submit a bill for the legislation to parliament in the netherlands following delays from politicians and eu member states. while refusing to speculate on how long that timeline might be, hofmann hinted that a number of variations of the system might be involved. ""we're trying to gather more data,"" he said. ""there's a big risk in this, but we're also not going to give an estimate of the length and type of disruption, which we think would require a lot of time."" there has been a small uptick in the number of uk-bound journeys by eu citizens since the uk reverted to the eu travel-ban, which has been credited by the cbi and others as a ""proportionate response"" to the problem. however, hofmann warned that when the rules apply, people need to be aware that they might not be able to go to the united states because the travel document still exists on the european system. once they do, travelers will be able to enter their vehicle online, which will help ensure they're not screened or killed. if they're not, they'll be able to leave the car. the transport minister gerard canete told associated press that the country of origin for several european ports have been suspended for checks, but the shutdown will still take place, he said. cetteete also made it clear that it's important to allow people to hold passports in the hands of the time when they're most vulnerable.",grover

237,"Biking to work appears more dangerous than other commuting options, study finds (cnn) — cycling to work is something that bothers up several people who can't stand boredom in the middle of the night, says a new study published in psychological science. most people end up skipping cycling, and those who skip cycling struggle to find parking, and are unable to do much of anything. but the 2-year study sheds light on what is meant by a ""bad habit."" using data from the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), researchers think it's a sign of boredom that bicycling allows people to safely try to ride. that's in part because americans ride more than 190 million miles every year. that can lead to bottlenecks -- or, in some cases, chronic traffic congestion -- that make it even more frustrating for those who will stop to pedal. ""biking for a problem is certainly one of the most frustrating activities, a reality that improves just as we all experience it, and provides us with alternative ways to engage in these activities,"" study author andrea cullen, a psychology professor at northwestern university in evanston, illinois, said in a statement. to test the correlation between cycling and depression, cullen and her colleagues recruited 1,076 adults from the united states and the dominican republic. in the study, they quizzed them about how much they travel. (a large national sample is designed to improve its accuracy.) after their finding, they asked them to complete a specific trail across the u.s. that they cycle to work. for each trail, they asked them to set aside two minutes per day. then they took a half hour. if they completed the task on time, they would go on a 10-mile commute. the researchers found that people who bike to work tend to spend more time cycling than those who don't. as a result, they left more time for bicycles than people who bike to work. but cyclists had a higher rate of fatigue fatigue than people who don't bike to work. they also reported a higher rate of headaches, and had an increased body temperature over the study period. the researchers believe that sharing information with one's primary co-worker or co-worker's boss is helpful in building a positive relationship between cycling and the work experience. ""if shared information is beneficial, this could also improve the quality of the experience,"" said kathleen gray, assistant professor of organizational psychology at duke university in durham, north carolina. however, ""it would be difficult and economical to recruit a co-worker on a bicycle who is spending some time on a bike,"" gray added. ""many in the transportation community prefer to stay on the road, unless they live in poorer areas."" the work-experience comparison isn't aimed at novice cyclists or those who can't easily switch to a crowded and crowded ride. in order to contrast the divide between people who cycle to work and those who are less physically fit, the researchers also tracked riders' exercise habits. the study shows that cycling makes people happier, even if they're on the most crowded roads. cyclists who reported having enough exercise on a bike were 45% less likely to report decreased symptoms of depression. a study published in the american journal of preventive medicine, earlier this year, indicated that bicycling could help people who've struggled to control their stress. at times, cycling can be very stressful, experts say. some biking marts have turned people into subway riders, taking sides in sexual assault. and driving can cause distractions when listening to music while driving, and late at night, researchers say.",grover

(it should be noted that the disease usually leaves behind no identifiable microorganism.) the cdc may recommend that adults born in west africa apply for immediate government or other protective measures. in the u.s., some states may impose a 50% or higher death limit for all infected individuals. at the other end of the scale, the environmental protection agency has some guidelines that may help figure out what to do with people infected with coronavirus-like viruses. they have already issued a jan. 26 directive that has prompted questions. cases or infections which have been previously discovered in europe have involved people who also contracted the virus but contracted nothing. but it might not be enough to stop the virus. and if the cdc does decide to initiate an outbreak, this could be that very time, especially as high-profile companies are testing novel potential treatments. overall, it appears the federal government has had enough of the coronavirus outbreak, so what happens if people break the symptoms and either die or start spreading the virus? it's also important to remember that coronavirus can be lethal if not treated in a timely manner. and you can't use it to shut down the nation's healthcare system. for the moment, the cdc's guidance has focused on providing care to ill victims, although ""final"" advisories are still being sent out. ""health professionals in commonwealths are instructed to advise with the aim of preparing for a possible outbreak and providing care to those affected,"" as reported by the health information technology agency. they say as with any outbreak, the most important thing to know is that the person who dies or is infected has the potential to spread the virus to others — including through people you know — through regular contact with them. if they hit someone in the clinic, for example, they may spread the virus to other people or encourage others to come in contact with them. this could turn out to be contagious illness after treatment, or in fact to be lethal. but what happens if the vaccine hasn't been successfully administered? and does death occur without the vaccine in the patient's lifetime? ""we can confidently say that, at this stage, no suspected cases of coronavirus have been reported,"" dr. john ingle, director of the cdc's centers for disease control and prevention, wrote on a telephone briefing thursday. the cdc hasn't had one case of a coronavirus, but for the most part, coronavirus cases are relatively rare, compared with the worldwide outbreak. the world health organization says 65 cases of coronavirus in children have been confirmed in the united states and 73 in developing countries. the cdc currently takes about one case per day. the cdc is aiming to have three cases per day in 2018 and four every day from 2020 to 2050.",grover

""there are so many crazy sex stats like pregnancy and leg pain, and we take the analog efforts we create with sex brain and design those out to create these thoughts,"" elda said. sexty is a platform designed to be used for recruitment and real-life adoption. to be a sex innovator, elda says that sex devices should address the issue of how sex experiences are expressed and delivered.

(she held back a japanese face-painting technique a decade ago). the exhibition was filmed and later morphed into a six-episode miniseries on bang showbiz, a photo magazine started out as a youth radio program called bras. in the series, shep met six-year-old classmate luen yuxiang, who appeared in three films in hong kong. she took over the lead role as luen. (luen is also spelled ""l."" the show is filmed on location in the streets of shanghai's forbidden city.) luen is exhibited and interviewed this year in a series of monthly ""shen yun style"" concerts. while traveling the apron strings around my neck, i noticed a tall, black face with braces. the slight redity wasn't noticeable, until i realized that most of her teeth were crooked. although i don't know the name of her, i'm using a name that is derived from her own appearance. ""brained,"" ""partial,"" or ""substantial,"" or ""arty,"" i choose. like many of the dozens of banned apps, using a combination of the two is a pain. the app requires a password to open, but that is usually handled using a password base-style control app. the new apps appear to focus on perfecting the look of natural-looking faces. i didn't have much trouble finding the masks of iyang da(pronounced ""satire"") and li ying(pronounced ""ho""). one, li hak'an (pronounced ""yyushu""), looked like a legendary figure of chinese culture, and an unusual color: dark blue. i bought one. i waited an hour and a half to order it, waiting for a one-hour wait in the museum. (the wait in china has become even longer with overnight wait times.) in hindsight, i might have been even happier. in november 2015, chinese national poet han yanjing launched the #wearerschoosedresses hashtag, noting that women who weren't wearing lots of makeup, including brows, would be forced to wear brows on their face in order to achieve a suitably glamorous face. i bought a mask two months later. two years later, the company that runs the registry is making a sweater, a baseball cap and sunglasses. the face effect or weare app campaign, which was featured in china's much-hyped video festival, is a little more complicated. the brand identifies themselves by the positioning of the brand's products. besides the facial masks, the app named its position app allows users to search for a different cosmetics brand each month. to me, weare's app seemed geared more toward developing better faces. maybe that's why it hasn't yet caught on in china. in the meantime, i can buy a mask and take part in a parade in eastern china, where like most cities in china, the market is saturated. i'll try it, or at least try to research a new face. innovation in face masks and makeup isn't limited to china. in france, labels used by such industry giants as procter & gamble and estee lauder were opened to foreign consumers. antonio collin, ceo of china's herb cult, says there are over 170 makeup brands in china. he says china represents at least 40% of the fashion apparel, beauty and accessories consumers there. his company has produced close to 300 face masks and facial masks, he said.",grover

251,"Louvre Abu Dhabi: Enter the 'universal museum' of human creativity to infinity and beyond! the museum has been on a mission, with an ambitious timeline, to explore, in cooperation with more than 40 museums worldwide, from seoul to the vatican. by creating an immersive experience designed to replicate the unique experience of art history, ""desmond,"" as it's called, aims to give visitors a perspective on the exhibition at which it is housed. from its examination of architecture at the national design museum, the paris-based museum is now drawing on the spiritual, artistic and metaphysical power of human creativity. the museum, which has 12 exhibitions currently, encompasses exhibits showing many of the human studies, works by intelligent and mathematical artists, movement and speech-making on the 21st century, along with concepts such as mind control, simulated communication, mental theory and intensive physiotherapy. these are among the many avenues connected by the architecture and philosophy museum, conceived by artist morte auguste neumann, who is able to lay out whole sets of concepts, as well as explication each individual component of art, in vibrant and expertly executed exhibit designs, readjustments, etchings and variations of existing and future works. the level of detail required to develop these materials, is extensive, said petra csi, the children's curator and an expert on human form and psychology at the uae museum. by creating precise details of a specific geometric structure, neumann explains the effects of materials upon performance and mechanics, as well as describe mechanisms by which individual artforms form from bodily and physical measurements, to other mental or physical conditions, are being perceived by and from our daily lives. ""the spaces that the design creates are functional, allowing individual artisans to create it and in-between, express themselves,"" said pergutta kaweng, who organized the show, which was organized by tiffany & co. in cooperation with new york's rosenfeld gallery. kaweng's piece is made of artistic materials, such as inks, carved woods, potted quartzite and polished watercolors. each piece is represented in three types -- the first decoration is handmade complete with polychrome laminate, the last with brass laminate, fluke, habanero and silver spade. a board creates a two-dimensional interpretive surface that can stand out in a showing room. each piece is treated with a functional seal that cleans up and moulds the surface of each piece for the entire presentation. csi understands that the ""universal museum"" is part of a larger artistic vision of the uae, created to appeal to audiences around the world, rather than just the uae's values, similar to those expressed by artisans in norway and france. the installation will coincide with the installation of the opening of the museum's permanent collection next year.

""the uae has opportunities to work alongside other african countries and with other regional and international bodies, but we also need to work with some internationally recognized organizations and institutions like the african arts museum, as the number of institutions seeking african content comes down,"" she said.",grover

259,"Has the wooden skyscraper revolution finally arrived? (cnn) - building by the buzz word in construction-speak, a slender, elevated tunnel has finally arrived for shuttered south tower at tokyo's nikkei tower. tokyo skyscraper crews have been hard at work for months to build the monument, which boasts 2,770-foot ceilings and supports every conceivable structure imaginable: shipbuilding, oil rigs, schools, churches and waterfront parks. construction is just beginning on a colossal concrete pyramid - a towering eight-story skyscraper measuring more than 26,000 feet (11,000 meters). the project, tied up in a 1998 tokyo earthquake, and which is scheduled to begin at the end of the month, is finally heading into completion. with so much need for it to start, construction was initiated more than a decade ago when the ninth-tallest building in the world, the 103-story anja fischer kochi new sails, opened in 2000. the 23rd-tallest building in the world, the 11th-tallest skyscraper, venice beach, went up later that year. the tallest building in america was actually the one that graced the plaza hotel in new york city. but the 16th-tallest building in the world, the 250-story sky tower in madison square garden, new york, was an unfinished macondo-sized record breaking hole constructed in 2011 after the 1929 stock market crash. that doesn't mean it won't happen again, though. ""for an encore in the garden theater, we're all going to be a generation older,"" said jamie barrett, senior executive vice president of toweraid, the nonprofit that brought the tower to life. the system already has ties to former red sox pitcher, owner and finance chief jack neidhardt. in a garage, neidhardt spent 10 years building a variety of buildings with his family, including a one-story transmission tower and public housing units. he designed the facade of the maison mocourt, a 6th-floor facade tower, erected in 1912 and that was the most decorated building by any of the american businesses in the financial capital. ""our millennial generation that's stuck with it has always been very supportive of it,"" said jiro okamoto, the one-story general manager of tokyo-based teva, which is responsible for putting up the tower. ""once our marketing manager finishes putting up the towers, people start liking it. they love it. it's a unique asset."" the developer of the tower, tokyo dome development, recently released a six-page itinerary detailing the lobby, architect and exterior design, calling it ""the first augmented reality tower of all time."" on may 12, the tower will begin the first-ever use of 4g video camera technology. and in june, the home of the world's tallest buildings, the $42-billion rimyorashi twin towers, will be first to host a digital billboard. so what is all this like? unlike the similar projects of florence's beso tower in florence, this one'll get built around almost 60 meters of concrete. the last time it was completed, the los angeles town center, once touted as the world's tallest, opened the morning after the quake struck near the epicenter. for some, that was a disaster. ""we saw the city was going to change forever,"" said gordon hsiao, a 58-year-old retired teacher, who lives in hong kong, where the gates had been locked up. ""the last time that they built this in time for the next earthquake, it was more than eight feet tall. this time, i think a lot of people saw it, too. and very few saw how it was a relief."" a crucial part of the challenge is permitting. how many of the beams in the chimney of the first building, like the mammoth, adorn the second building, a 46-foot-tall structure called the reichmerukson, will need to be replaced? will it need to be built on an average of 10 feet of steel?

(he was also a molecular biologist at the time.) in march, china's ministry of industry and information technology issued a directive requiring manufacturers of consumer electronics from jan. 1, 2019, to create new devices containing the microchip technology by may 1, 2020. the policy was also meant to be seen as intended as a statement against china's display companies, as imagery they promote is widely viewed as evil, damaging its image in the international community and generating income for overseas tech giants like google and microsoft. in an interview with reuters in beijing, wen said he had spent a year in incubation between the two sides of the accelerator program, which also includes work at the china institute of digital electronics and recycling. even as well as working in a lab, he also ""had a lot of research experience developing electronics."" his work in the lab in 2016, he said, included drawing textiles, jewelry, products and street merchandise on the insides of microgreens, which serve as catalyst. an artist rendering of the current growth and development of microtechnology over the past 10 years. courtesy of internorth london, usa. during a conversation with reuters, wen said, ""i don't see it as a legacy project. i see it as a skillful service project.""

""the new approach is designed to ensure that we have continuity with some elements of lgbt politics,"" pyoo said in a facebook post. ""we believe this approach will block their advancement."" pyoo further called on the central government to ""make accommodations for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (lgbt) community and for it to receive the same government support as that of the minority."" the local government has been trying to make accommodations for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (lgbt) community, who can come out comfortably in their bedrooms or on outings in public places but have increasingly become targets of campaigns to gain visibility. pro-lgbt lawmakers have resisted efforts by the mayor of seoul and park geun-hye to implement gay rights that contribute to the 30 percent drop in overall crime in the south korean capital in the past five years. police at a tour of the hundreds of drag venues that have sprouted since their registration on ellis island in new york in 1986 seem optimistic that seoul will join the large number of trans community in extortive acts of prostitution, sex trafficking, drug deals and other crimes. more than 40 states have enacted laws that allow people to use, sell or let others use sex-edas, but no laws have been enacted to effect the same thing. anti-trans activists generally have the support of conservative seoul society.

""what is important for us in south korea is that things have been worked out to make that all possible."" siding up seoul also presented its vision for increased visibility and attention to the lgbt community. it urged the government to enact its policies in a time of economic growth. it called for continuing to listen to south korean values and dignity — something that south korea shares with china and japan. walander also hopes to go to the supreme court in a non-confrontational lawsuit that would demand that seoul's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender population ""be allowed to use a variety of civil-liberties protections as well as the right to have adult children available."" it is far from clear that the gay and transgender population will get any pass from park geun-hye on other issues because she and park are allies and friends, not business partners. as parts of seoul continue to grapple with unwanted expressions of anti-lgbt sentiment, activists are grappling with how to deal with a ""culture of fear,"" said thae woo-sook, a professor of indonesian cultural and human rights. ""one of the most important and important things is avoiding the perception that people are closeted,"" said kim tsang, who helped organize a drag party sunday, where the police arrested people who had come from other districts. north korean authorities have tried to poke the spotlight off south korea by turning undercover sting operation into a high-profile pr exercise, in which they roughed up residents for being lgbt. the judge presiding over the prosecution's latest case against 50 people may refer to the groups by their names. woo-sook said the upcoming court hearings will not work on the same level as the recent arrest of the city's gay rights activist. ___ follow susan levy on twitter at www.twitter.com/ssamy",grover

""i think it's interesting that the picture of a man who has been a knight in knight's defence in 75 or so, it's not always the right thing to take,"" he tells cnn in a phone interview. for stan's next task, he plans to show a man he once tried to seduce by saying, ""i don't mind lying in bed a lot,"" but not hanging out with ""old b*****d"" types.

273,"Fashion gaffes are a reflection of the industry's diversity problem a year ago i was in new york for a gathering of today's fashion geeks and faffes. it wasn't glam nation, but a rather eclectic week of fashion, conversations, and reclusiveness. i was invited to a starbucks, my apartment, and house in manhattan to learn how important i could be more than just the cause of change. on the eve of valentine's day, i joined the challenge of co-creating the first trans-made furs in history. i hesitated briefly, but fortunately i had the courage to enter the vision because everyone else had already joined. there's a conversation to be had in my soul, but the idea of trans firsts as a commodity has nothing to do with the speed and scale of trans commercialization or the rigidity of policy. it comes from people who can't catch up to the modern space. in addition to the subway rail, the first ever transgender person to be recognized in chicago was isabel toledo, who's experienced 100km (42 miles) of traveling through a safe, secure and secure environment. an amazing second came from nine year old abbie hallett – the youngest person ever to do so. her journey was a journey of hands-on empowerment. she had, and will continue to have, the courage to pursue her dreams while completing the all-time comestibles. can anyone else really afford to be a part of a straight, cisgender, cis-male fashion house? in finding ways to create trans-inclusive artists of every stripe, women and men wanted input from their peers. within a year the fashion design community of brooklyn had joined forces. the fashion a/c process has evolved from body positivity and acceptability to inclusion, connecting one another to the cultures, histories, passions and values in the fashion world. it's everywhere, and in the fashion world. being trans-inclusive was a big part of it. in 2014, california was the first state to allow for gay marriage. this attracted a lot of new followers, since the state said: ""all men are entitled to equal rights, but the lack of equality prohibits the most basic freedoms like right to life and the ability to have a meaningful life."" most importantly, ""all men are entitled to equal rights, but the lack of equality prohibits the most basic freedoms like right to life and the ability to have a meaningful life."" meanwhile, social media grew. there were many who jumped into the cause and enrolled. nick hornby, for example, took to twitter to call out the trans community's indifference. he added the hashtags: #""toglifettogender (@nathosefinnegan) and #toglifettoforward (@sasharharmon) and his hashtag #theglenfosterfoordidit. celebrities also took to twitter to engage in solidarity and sharing their stories about their experiences. when it comes to making shoes, i will forever stay on the fence about the color of the shoe – sometimes i prefer light to dark. as in a way, while the choice on price and gender identity might be aesthetic and for whatever reason we are nothing but people's worst nightmares, we are nothing but people's most crucial assets. ultimately, it's about how you use them in a way that respects the person you are and allows them to provide the greatest contribution to your life. we all have an unmet need for shoes. without the visibility we have, we are out of step with the beliefs we hold, and we don't build businesses from ethical ideals or even the ideals that are a beacon to the world. it's not about whether we wear certain clothes, or if we choose to wear jewelry. it's about how we respond to being in this new world, and how we embrace being alive. the tide is turning in 2014. i've no doubt about the outside job models that will develop.",grover
274,"Battle of Supremes: How 'legal fakes' are challenging a $1B brand san diego (cnn) -- it's the crazy or not the weird, all pretty messy shop that has gamers like me scrambling for the stars of the third weekend in a row at a microsoft game. that's because the big white-and-red of the year's biggest and strangest games, with an infusion of superman versus the wwe, a large, shiny, and widely popular four-player grappling match, and a massive brawl here and there, is precisely the kind of game microsoft has long dreamed of producing. ""i don't think this is the world we are trying to create,"" said john riccio, managing director at digital director international, a firm that handles planning for the games the company hopes to release for xbox one and other platforms over the next year. riccio praised microsoft's early efforts to put out legitimate contenders in the genre, like neverwinter nights with marius in 2010. last year, rsco snatched up an original battlefield game for playstation 4 and netflix originals' the collection of crunk costumes for xbox one. but how many former battlefield games played, and what grip, is a hard question to answer, riccio, a lot of observers agree. a sense that some of the games conceived to expand the genre, like threshold electronic arts' sierra sons, force of empires' god of war: ascension, were destined to fail remains a mystery to those who have the privilege of watching major new releases of the game world. here's how the details about a new game into the franchise had to be translated by blizzard entertainment to fans' ears, and how much of the game conversation had to happen in specific chapters where clans in medieval japan were fighting over knights and dragon. the newest game iteration still ""stinks,"" said riccio. and the words ""ring"" and ""sword"" offer no insight into what to expect from the game until it's released. over time, though, the games are evolving, and take the story by surprise and blow a soft blow. as a result, it's clear that hardcore gamers are suffering from spasms in their concentration as they try to keep up with new franchises that we haven't seen before. robot is a relative newcomer to competitive gaming. ""it's kind of a weird game, and people like it,"" said mikea johnson, one of these figures. in many ways, the game is like a hit for shrek that's in keeping with the show's popularity. after the first shrek cartoon, fans flocked to the batman reboot that spawned a total of 40 million worldwide copies, selling out their shows and conventions across the globe. still, one shows why console makers aren't on their best behavior. nintendo did a huge effort to ""disrupt"" its popular motion-sensing console, the wii u. the game system -- meant to better mimic wii u's motion sensing features, plus the graphical software underlay -- showed it could be retrofitted to the motion-sensing changes, too. the motion-sensing technology was a key factor in the wii's breakthrough wii u and subsequent playstation predecessor, mario + rabbids kingdom battle. modern gaming is undergoing a ""quake"" that some critics fear could leave consoles behind with games being held out of common viewing purpose. last year, halo fans gasped at the rumors microsoft had ""walked away"" from a reboot of the halo franchise. it wasn't without merit. it was worth its tarnished reputation, but it was also risky. microsoft is working on the next iteration of halo at microsoft. a link is already being put up to efforts to share inside information on the game. but what's easy to understand about star wars: galaxy of war, the latest entry in the star wars trilogy, is that star wars fans are turning to it to acknowledge that its modern, traditional fare is less interesting -- and (hopefully) comparable to a knockoff. star wars and its resurgence, of course, will ultimately be made up of all sorts of other people looking to progress the franchise for the sake of keeping both fan interest and buzz alive. but there's one game that calls itself an ""integrated systems integrator,"" meaning it's somewhere in between the cutting-edge games companies like sony, warner bros. studios and, on the whole, microsoft's games.",grover

276,"The designers changing the conversation around lingerie one of the coolest trends in lingerie is getting more fully focused. leading the conversation comes the statement age group that is strongly dominated by the 'fashion' line (of the more recent era) and has, for many, transformed the bulk of its time. the dramatic transformation in the 1990s, as well as the powerful influence on teenage models such as jessica simpson, kendall jenner and bella hadid, has created a long-term core group of cool young women in powerful roles. ""designers are interested in having a greater influence on this shift,"" says meg white of asos, who discovered a time-honored trend that drove early adopters and their clients into new forms of luxury. models, if you have dreamed of seducing and showing a glimpse of yourself, are now once again the face of the brand. gone are the days when models focused on the sexiness, the luxe comfort and the glamor of the clothes. look no further than tommy hilfiger's fall 2013 show in his signature designer studio. ""in the past few years, we've established greater influence on models by getting everyone talking, including the race, that is who they are, and which clothes make their person,"" he says. ""this includes a greater fear, confidence and sense of self."" since the start of fashion's shift toward more premium stretchwear, craftiest menswear designers have brought their pieces into vogue. no more traditional lace and sheer dresses and tuxedo-like jackets (but no longer are they so off-the-wall). no more decadent vixen outfits, just regular ones that give the image and fun of the brand. the health and beauty trend, which, until now, was more focused on women's needs, is back in fashion. ""only a few years ago, it was considered that the top ladies did lingerie,"" says white. ""instead, we see a crop of bold, inspired garments that reflect the current industry."" look no further than the elaborately embroidered calvin klein pieces and elevated pop in the spring runway, an ad for this should surprise no one. ""i understand and appreciate young women getting the attention and the attention to themselves, the treatment they receive,"" says white. ""but instead of trying to force the attention back on other women, they're repackaging something very powerful and frivolous."" and with that more tailored in mind, brands like hermes, givenchy and balenciaga are now diving deeper into the wearables space. in 2018, the trendiest fabric in the runway was the stainless-steel beige, with the runways serving as an appropriate jumping-off point. now, over 50 percent of dresses in showrooms are in stainless-steel; 5 percent are in black leather and slim-capped tykes. at the same time, designers are expressing some of their own thinking on the subtlety of the fabrics that feed into the wearable elements they're designed to deliver. they're mixing elements of both bathroom and air purifier systems, extending the era to make actual men's clothing look literally woven in an important way. ""the goal is to fully develop our wearables into custom-designed garments with the natural relationship of texture to function,"" says oren karstinic, president of dolce & gabbana group. one of the ways these innovations can stretch the boundaries and impact on everyday life is by giving people what they crave. in a recent interview with french media, topshop founder patrick stewart described his new line inspired by heartthrobs like rebecca minkoff, david jones and alexander mcqueen. the italian designer would have nodded nodded as he wowed his entire audience in wearing skin-tight, tasseled gowns that mucked out a backpack, while wearing one hand underneath. but with the new tone, the streetwear is becoming more sophisticated, comfortable and chic. ""the french look is much more deeply focused on the black leather and t-shirts; trousers are luxe yet they don't feel like everyday-life staples,"" says white.

279,"Why Beijing's Serpentine Pavilion signals a new age for Chinese architecture like a clear path to a higher order. for the week of april 5-13, the chinese government has put a palpable new age under control, leaving the grand central ballroom in new york city to its rear, a new public space to chart china's new urban scene. the belt and road initiative, which officially kicked off on june 23, is a massive effort to launch cities across asia toward denser urban living and innovation. that is because china's 80 million urbanites are aging -- moving from urban cores, especially in cities, to expanded suburbs and urban mores. these data can be a significant shift from ""modernist"" cities like beijing and shanghai, where new and redeveloped areas are being ground zero. as a result, the beijing theme park is much closer to suburban and new design. the theme park is called serpentine, for ""our new design"" and features a glorified glass terrace for elephants. it's open daily from 12:30 to 5:15 p.m. it also offers a ""great park"" -- which caters to hong kong, the capital of china -- that enables young urbanites to travel underdeveloped island-like islands for breathtaking views of the city. the design is heavy on modernism. it includes scenes like bright blue tents and huge lights the size of around 2,000 ping pong balls. its centerpiece features 52 stories of 'deconstructed' tall skyscrapers (about the size of a basketball court) which are a source of modern urban architecture. imagine creating 200 or more high-rise contemporary buildings of the kind unveiled in new york. then there's the tower of tsukuba, one of the tallest structures in the city, with 30 freestanding ""sinks"" in its tower. it's an historic landmark, one of only two in japan that still hang as an ancient temple of the cross-hunting kakaburu warrior. when it was completed in 2004, it was seen as the dawn of urban culture, in which rich oil and coal resources, fresh air and raw materials are turned into urban scenery. over time, it became a model of asian design -- its ""houses of the 21st century,"" said chinese architect wang yunxiong in an extensive exhibit at the yangtze river cultural center in beijing. the size of tower of tsukuba? no big deal, as liu yunxiong pointed out. it spans 18-24 miles and costs about $32,000 -- which, no, the guangzhou studio had earlier mentioned during its time as the premier of theme parks. but that number is much smaller than what the tower of tsukuba cost. as for the central theme park (called serpentine gardens), last month, the movement of the exterior of the 3-story pyramid, unveiled a distinctive ""multi-nocket"" -- a six-tiered structure that expands on the grid. it will be visible for 60 years, according to wang. the biggest design update is in the design and construction of the public and residential buildings, which is already scheduled to be completed before the end of the year. wang said that the new public square city is the closest city to the serpentine that has yet to be completed -- for a host of reasons, not the least of which is that officials have suspended construction. the changes will come at a great cost. this summer, the people's liberation army will declare a regional championship football tournament, which will mark the grand opening of the capital's new baseball stadium. tickets for that tournament are already sold out, according to wang. and then there's the sight of the grand opening of the 13,000-seat east river aquatic center, which is expected to debut in november. it will be open through september.",grover

""aren't you lovely?"" she asked. ""look there she is,"" he replied. ""she's beautiful and i am going to marry her!"" i see myself hanging out with the handsome, smiling gentleman that accompanies me on trips to muslim temple sites. i see women in pink and gold rubbing shoulders with the men that side me instead of falling asleep at the couch. i see beauty in women like tila de larraga, whose amazing eye makeup instantly brightened up the eyes and forehead with the rubbery side of her forehead down. i feel incredible right now when i see makeup, mascara, bronzer and loose lips that reveal the bumps and brown and mottled breast, and even skin-tone scales from the after-dark hours of the beach. it's hard not to picture my mom at the beach in the morning with another woman, drinking a glass of soapy water, floating in a bucket full of coconut and trying to scoop the rough seas off my arm. by the time the surf came up, every penny was piling up, the river was pouring rain with smoke and rain, so me and my grandma were sweating through their hair and i stumbled across a gray island before the ocean moved into the middle of the tarp and i managed to cover up my coat and brow. i remember the rainbow logo boards on my glasses reading ""bulory theme."" in a lull, i looked over at the tree in the street where the rock stopped so i could snorkel over there and help my cousins at home to reconnect with where they live and what they missed the most. somehow, i found ourselves inside a safe room and realized that my mom's adventure was just going to live on. we could be cousins, grandparents and husbands and parents, grandmothers and granddaughters. today we look forward to sitting in the cave on saturday mornings where we can relax and enjoying our curls and see our fair cousins as i do. when i forget, i hope i forget and know there are so many different things that made my mom happy, old and young. we couldn't make this trip without my mom. she did a fascinating job of bringing elegance into her world, giving high standards of elegance to her workforce, their home and her home's life. i loved being there and felt cared for and respected, but i would never forget why i chose to be there. i wonder whether today we will have the same kind of sense of community that my grandmother's brand icon raised. are there any ways we can feel more self-acceptance today and share our beauty experiences with each other? i'll never tell them, but i hope so.",grover

287,"El Helicoide: The futuristic wonder that now sums up Venezuela's spiral into despair it's at a distant middle-class apartment block in downtown caracas on the south side of petare avenue, where neighbors from the capital's wealthiest families have started to demolish buildings and annex entire neighborhoods. just days ago, miraflores palace, the sprawling neighborhood center that spanned the neighborhood from central avenue to centro and beyond, was being used as the trump national football league headquarters of the fledgling economic and commercial institute, or eec. until this past week, it was a fixture in the neighborhood's nightlife: a sprawling array of cafe, bar, nightclub, movie theater, impromptu nightclub, and the world's tallest roof over the south barraza boulevard to the right. but the alameda was soon headed for an even further odder frontier: venezuela's newest capital, at the highly trafficked intersection of petare and carrillo. so, on wednesday, the city's planning commission and valor development agency began enforcing an ordinance mandating that any buildings being demolished, or an annex or control in one of the adjacent neighborhoods, be no more than occupied and recoup all of the cost with no profit. the legislation, passed with the council's approval and then briefly approved in a meeting attended by representatives of the venezuelan red cross and medical society, is now going to the national council of municipalities and most of the elderly. but i like what i'm seeing: giant dusting clouds of dust, which would, in this new era of desertification, make living as normal as the market would, and my friends at the keyboard baglaw have given a concrete forecast for the next two decades: ""the rubicon at the intersection of telesallu and the barraza is a bright, vibrant community,"" said the woman from the community, stephanie bowers. ""the new rules are already forcing us to move into mass demolitions. when the plans begin to come out, they will start demolishing people's doors, their houses and even the families' televisions. and of course, my friend who just moved in [from dominguez] is still in a construction project."" and it's not just people who are in hot demand, according to bowers. it's also high-profile citizens from caracas, el salvador, and el salvador. they have dedicated weeks or days worth of activity in the neighborhood to making the rubicon's wake up. ""just over the past four days, our partners in the project have been busy building hundreds of new façades, upgrades and rebuilds that make access from petare & caracas terminal congest to caracas public buildings that also occupy the space,"" said banistan valerioz, a nearby urban planner, who admitted that she received a phone call about her good-looking neighbors' demolition plans on wednesday. what's even more exciting is that residents from nearby neighborhoods have been raised in this uneasy orbit: frequently bombed by crime, chaos and evil. venezuela isn't the first country in which neighbors have tried to break up families or families have tried to build new ones. in 2013, some cities developed a three-part plan where one wall of regulation were to be temporarily erected, one wall used to be to prevent the building of houses, and one wall was to be erected to prevent the demolition of trees and other delicate fields, to ensure a stable environment for farmers and the rest of the building-and-developing country. which is precisely what venezuelan residents are demanding. thousands marched and chanted with the demolition of neighborhood homes in caracas. but in caracas, they were only one part of a bigger plan that promises to push the neighborhoods like plague – illegal structures, scaring off or breaking up residents, especially homeless people. without a sense of direction, the neighbors are left wondering just how important the new government is to their neighborhood, which is undergoing a so-called zero-emission revolution.",grover

""since change is as much about staff and services, our findings suggest that change-oriented, heavy editing of short and long investigative reports is more likely to require post-shutdown operations,"" the company said. of the 82 corporate divisions that made up 83% of cnn's distribution and production staff in the past 12 months, 39% had no people at their desks during the shutdown. that figure may have declined, but there were still 11,000 people at cnn's main newsroom. some studios had relationships that were devoted to researching conservative media like wired, and some projects looked at ways to fight climate change, emarketer said.

297,"One man lost his life savings in a SIM hack. Here's how you can try to protect yourself a man was killed when a bogus sim card linked to his iphone suddenly turned on and ripped off his bank account and then switched on at&t, at&t said on monday. dangerous times, lies, fake phones! you could be hacked to lose your job. but how to protect yourself? if you've been a victim of hacking your phone, you should contact your banks about two things: a bank is held responsible for the sim card usage and a check isn't the only source of funds, at&t said. here's how: you can get rid of any sim-card modules that someone used, as you would if an iphone. for example, if you have a couple that have sim cards, consider swapping one on each you need to stay in touch or what the bank is charging for the sim cards. more frequent than that, if you carry less than 1 of those with you, or if your phone doesn't show its three times normal speed, take the phone off a sim card. while the bank wouldn't publicly say exactly how many sim cards were used, a person's sim card would still be valid after withdrawal. all other networks are following the same standard as customers. the us federal trade commission says it's an ad-hoc agency to track stolen credit and debit cards and trace the payments to an account. google and mycit is also doing this. now that it's a viable program, you can try to limit the risk by disguising the sim card as a mobile phone. under the us copyright act, a bank has the right to collect information on your phone and reimburse its customers. if a bank ever conducts that investigation, it is liable to have you remove your mobile phone, at&t said. you should make sure the bank hasn't failed to conduct an investigation, and you don't make suspicious purchases unless you have a legitimate credit card or travel card. that doesn't seem like a high priority, at&t said. at&t says you can trace your phone to an account with the bank. you'll have to be specific about your possible account information in order to notify the bank of your identity theft. you can also change your location, perhaps by getting off a samsung smartfinder, at at&t's branch at kbm bond in savannah, georgia. it doesn't make it easy, but you can receive payment for any transaction. there's no telling how many you can swap sim cards to another sim card, at&t says. and though at&t is still working with banks to determine if a bank will have to cover any sim cards up front, it doesn't seem like you will be able to dispute where you're transferring funds from when your phone suddenly turned on, at&t said. if you're concerned that your sim card won't work again if your phone turned on, you can seek a new sim card with at&t in exchange for a swap. the bank will pay the money back as soon as the sim card is recovered, at&t said. but that might not be a perfect solution for emergencies and emergencies that can be caused with phones simply out of circulation or while you've been using the sim card. it might be time to move the sim card from a usb to a charging stand for battery power, at&t said.",grover

308,"What is a bear market? new york — this is a question that most americans are asking themselves. the answer seems likely, and it depends on which way you take it. the bear market has started out with a slight uptick, but it quickly rose to a rally of sorts, reaching an all-time high of 11.28 before slipping back to a five-week low in the early morning hours. and as the supply of high-quality stocks gradually increased, stocks rebounded — especially in the fine industrial and consumer stocks sectors. and this has not led to a long, steady, frothy rally. we're not here to rest on this evidence. what is a bear market? it's not just about 1.2% annual growth, as the standard & poor's 500 index appears to be getting, but also of roughly 0.8% annual rate for the past five years, according to a 2005 survey by the msci world index and by my own calculation as a number of guru custodians from goldman sachs group inc. it's based on the theory that every expansion in prices leads to further price declines. but we may look back at the record 2001 bear market as that one. the big-cap telecommunications operator xcel energy inc. has been one of the worst performers over the past three years, losing over 90% of its value to the late 1990s and 2001 recession. ""we are watching the drop in stock prices as a way to gauge if it's more likely that the rise in prices is becoming more like that behavior than something else,"" marc birtel, the portfolio manager of gamco investors, told cnnmoney. ""all the big changes are going to come from the rise in the price of certain stocks and that changes the number of people who feel comfortable with that."" one major reason this could impact stock prices is due to the fear of higher corporate debt rates. earlier this year, the federal reserve eased interest rates for the first time since 2009. these lowered borrowing costs reflect a desire by consumers to invest even more in their homes and retirement plans. then they see these higher interest rates get pushed up by the credit markets, particularly those with lower-rate mortgages. while those higher interest rates may be a negative factor, the ""only rationale for selling stocks is a fear of rising prices,"" said rick jaffe, an analyst at technomic inc. in new york. ""as households grow more comfortable borrowing money to make purchases, they need an asset to buy back."" indeed, the s&p 500 recently hit a 5-week high. with profit taking taking the market higher — folks selling stocks because the rally is too slow to grind upward — stock prices are being sold again, jaffe said. others in the investing world say there are some signs that things may pick up, but not as quickly as some people may be hoping for. ""many investors recognize the premise that the current high doesn't reflect expectations,"" said nicole trimingham, the chief investment officer of north shore financial group in new york. ""it's too soon to be a bear market. but when you have a so-called bubble-buster or bubble-gum type of event, you can do damage."" as for stocks that took a hit last week, trimingham said it's not enough for investors to own them because the down-cycles do not seem to have started. if they are able to survive, ""we'll know the fears and uncertainties have been carefully thought through, and some are still unforeseeable."" jaffe said potential gyrations in the market are to be expected, but he doubts you need to panic to know they're high-risk. ""if people are still panicked, that could make that stock much more attractive for other investors and their portfolios. so your best bet is to put your money in stocks before a big downturn,"" he said. and that's ok if you don't want to make the mistake of buying stocks at ground zero for the next bear market. this is the question the experts are wondering. how do you evaluate where your money is based on what happened in the past?",grover
309,"How facial recognition went from bad TV to Big Brother what used to be called a ""facial recognition showcase"" goes through a new phase. researchers at the kansas city state university think of the show as an experiment in how people can use facial recognition software to recognize faces. since the program premiered in 2005, the vast majority of people who watch reality television are the standard ones. two thousand people may use the program for a while. but after it becomes available, most viewers will decide that's fine because facial recognition is made to recognize skin, ears, or facial expressions. the program uses a recording device. it records the movements of a person from a smartphone, adding those movements to the program. the hacker takes control of the camera, and turns that recording on. the program said this is the equivalent of scanning e-mails, making an entry on a page online, and then using facial recognition software to scan in the images. what did it do? the 'facial recognition showcase' attracted about 5.5 million viewers last september, according to web site beyond the head show. five years after initial stars bob marley and jamaican singer jessie j came along, the competition for the most ""touchtyles"" was completely closed. however, ex-smilting lord tim robinson says the program's viral appeal got real traction this week. he created #facialrecognitionshowcase within hours. wen at the turn of the century was the first non-local tv show to put on-screen face scans. the canadian police force that was like that show noticed a knock at the door of a new york city apartment. robinson received the required camera to scan into his nose, the motornet, and, after the game, his face was scanned in a flash, while presenter steve johnson played a ghost face in court testimony.

310,"How a coronavirus 'infodemic' is infecting the internet a coronavirus ""has recently hit the internet, infecting almost 1,000 people in just over a week, experts say, according to cnn digital bureau. it's not the first outbreak, though. earlier this year, five people died, and officials still have not released the virus' origins. but just this month, the centers for disease control and prevention said coronavirus activity for the moment was ""in progress"" and ""far advanced"". for now, though, coronavirus activity is clearly visible through the sky. in a viral-like outbreak, it infects adults and children, often in the run-up to christmas. and users of social media sites like snapchat are so informed that they are often sharing their personal details like where they have been staying at, instead of direct medical tests or identifying where they came from. nonetheless, there's a big difference between the two. infected people tend to be sick in one way and treated in another. individuals won't be rushed from hospital to hospital, nor will they be diagnosed in a doctor's office. the risk, at this point, is a little too low, because in the past, these things work out badly. the main event while the coronavirus is not completely unheard of — a norovirus was detected in 2012 at some california beaches, briefly causing severe vomiting, diarrhea and possibly kidney failure — this outbreak suggests that children are not immune to the virus. it's impossible to definitively say for sure — the public health agency is only starting to address the disease — but more and more people are becoming aware of the link between the virus and people. risk is in the air, though: people have been identified as potentially infected once or twice in the past, with potentially a fifth suspect being removed from the picture as the public health agency sees fit. and the viral viral sides of the animal cannot be spread by mean-spirited, harsh doses of immune systems. it can spread easily through viral transmissions. so, we can rest assured that the global warming solutions network is watching what happened and reporting on it. not knowing who to trust, and don't know which agencies are issuing updates on where they are reporting on the disease is as risky as the internet at this point. alas, the problem's still not totally solved. though coronavirus officials are looking for signs of the virus, while doctors are working on more than 2,000 cases, they haven't found evidence yet to support the notion that it is the cause of such a widespread outbreak. in its study about coronavirus, the cdc described the virulence of the virus, with the company mainly attributing increases in infections due to the potential to infect animals and humans. but that isn't the point. ""there's a terrific possibility that something more severe was going on, and it was not the lead element in the viral race,"" explained jane whitlock, chief epidemiologist at the cdc. ""the viruses represent a huge and thriving infection pathway, and that a lot of these factors play a role.""",grover

314,"5 things to know about the payroll tax washington (cnn) — americans will soon pay a second year of a five-year payroll tax cut, known as a 10% payroll tax. the tax was first phased in in 1991 to partially reduce the wealth gap. to read about it, click here. here are five things you should know about the tax for 2019: it's the longest of the tax cuts, which was enacted in 1991. the government has estimated the tax cut reduces the value of the u.s. dollar by almost $54 billion a year by year three. it's not automatic, however, so workers who do receive less income will pay more income tax for their workers. because the tax cuts take effect from 2019, at some point in time, the federal government will have paid approximately $50 billion in personal income taxes under this bill, a figure called the tax shelter. that's the cost of the tax in most states, and that's also the cost of the tax in taxpayers in more than half of the states that don't have a state tax shelter. the 11-year record was 12.2% by contrast, it was 19.8% when it took effect in 1995. the senate passed a law to lift the tax deferral period. by law, employees in states with a payroll tax are allowed to claim tax deductions after tax breaks have expired in a consecutive year. most of the people who took advantage of the program would have taken advantage of it if a sign-up had not been extended. employers will earn a lower personal exemption under the tax cut compared to the top of the range. to read about it, click here. saying ""sorry"" for it isn't going to lead to higher insurance premiums. the tax cuts are subject to a one-time rate of 39.6% based on the value of the u.s. dollar. it will remain at that level throughout the tax reform, which is scheduled to take effect on april 15. many of the remaining deductions will also be automatically taxable and indexed to inflation, which should make an impact on ratepayers who don't save enough to cover the government's obligations for the $8.5 trillion budget deficit, which grew by an average of 0.5% a year between 2013 and 2017. the tax law then also makes it more difficult for businesses to deduct annual employer-sponsored health benefits from their federal income taxes. for the first time, the costs will be shared among individuals and the states, which will make a cut in the corporate tax rate. if you're worried about losing your job, keep in mind that this plan does nothing for middle-class americans, who will receive fewer benefits and may pay more in taxes in some cases. the number of hard-earned tax credits will remain unchanged. the tax cut will also ease some of the capital gains tax rule. the estate tax will be halted after 2027 for estates exceeding $400,000. the tax cut, meanwhile, will go into effect for most estates and will lower income tax rates for families with assets valued at $1 million or more. those with more than $10 million in assets will still pay an exemption of up to $250,000. those with more than $50 million will be paid a tax break. the rates on individuals and couples with total assets exceeding $10 million will remain unchanged. companies will continue to be able to deduct other deductions from their federal income taxes.",grover
315,"Your coronavirus workplace questions answered if you started your career as a part-time student hoping to be a paid instructor and grad to partner with a local soup kitchen, you've been probably surprised at the number of job applicants who shy away from any discussions about workplace hazards. the workplace is about workplace conditions, pay, terms and conditions. every time you're asked about the companies you were hired to help, you turn around and go back to school on the cv with all those jobs left to you. we all know that there's something about the proximity of some cashing cash or home office that's really scary to some of us. so when we go to a place like southern california's orr agency, there's an internal workplace hazard code that sets a high bar for safety. how can you protect yourself in such situations? yes, employers need to be vigilant if a coworker or friend is making you the target of an on-set threat. thankfully, there are new safety rules being developed in california. thanks to the latest law you may be in too, to be even safe to work in the workplace. it's called the occupational safety and health act of 2007. the law requires that any interaction with a career operating operator – including video gaming, email or im — constitutes workplace hazards. some suggest a security guard and a cybersecurity guard. others suggest hazardous areas for anyone to work in with an on-call manager or doodler. to be considered a hazard, employers are required to make it clear who your supervisor or human resources department is and who authorized your to work there. when workers leave their jobs they are expected to have been doing a thorough and safe review of any potential hazards, whether it be related to the construction or warehouse work they have done, the medical condition of a member of the employer's medical team or the work rule that specifies a day that is required by the employer to leave. they also need to be able to be independent of the person or team that is allowing them to work in their workplace. once your employer makes it clear who authorized you to work in the workplace, you're legally protected from workplace hazards. you're not subject to workplace hazards like armed robbers or carjackers because you feel comfortable stepping out of their car after work and waiting for them to leave and risking your life. would that someone had been trying to blow up your lunch table and ruined the lunch of your coworker, while doing a gentle, due diligence for your mother's pediatrician or home physician, and everybody else who had worked there just because they loved the company's name? who would have prevented that. just imagine your coworker, waiting in line, pulling your shoe off and stuffing it in his pocket just to test the results. is that what you'd do? if you were able to avoid hazard, while it would be expected to bring the company to the point of tragedy, you'd have to come clean about the safety situation to the manager, your employees and also for the company. and you wouldn't be required to have a manager or a lot of supervisors to help you navigate. thankfully, the new regulations in california state that put a requirement for safe working conditions on the books for most employers have been effective. you'll have to change the paper job look-alike act to become a hazard. and if you work in an office space where hazards are not cleared, you'll soon have a warning issued by the contractor to protect your employees and get them to change their job looks-alike act before the new law takes effect. we're having the discussion ourselves. can you imagine what it would be like if your coworker thought of yourself as a producer in a field that might want them to place a product on a newsstand somewhere if the small supermarket they were standing at nearby was the target of a mechanical or manufacturing job? or how would that affect your ability to work your job? can you find yourself the life of a philosopher in a field with a bad write-up of your job? there are practical reasons to go back to school. the carbon emissions the u.s. emits can cause carbon dioxide production to skyrocket by 6.2 billion tons over the next 30 years. and lowering carbon emissions with carbon tax credits seems like a wise choice in the face of what we now know as the 28% to 40% reduction in carbon emissions from energy generation over the next 20 years. that much wind and solar burning alone wouldn't take four thousand or five thousand tons of carbon dioxide each year. in addition, if you work in a building with few or no employees and with no personnel check by inspections and training, you'll miss out on about 80% of total carbon emissions from that building. you might not make the job a good one but you're",grover

""you know just by the basic flaw of the game that the library lacks massive amounts of resources,"" said poppy champ, the founder of website slippery fishing. ""it's the holes and gaps you're missing in the game that make it so very difficult to program that library to program the game."" ""it's a blanket ban that says that you will not be able to play on all your devices, but unfortunately it's not true,"" said dave hankinson, the product development director at address. to combat this problem, you can turn off folders, not folders, off all supported libraries. to do this, you need a second set of folders and screenshots. ""making a small substitution a few days later and a full library in the same image and location was probably just a matter of designing a little additional library that people could download and use,"" hankinson said. hankinson said doing that simply required combining two unrelated libraries, and the potential is there for long-term benefits that will outweigh any negative consequences if you accept the message. ""if you can't master the art of maintaining libraries, then it's somewhat less important that you rely on positive forums where people share stories and look into the exploits of holes and quakes and other unexpected and controversial events.""

""but we also need to make sure the ecosystem of developers, everyone on the platform, engages developers as we evolve."" developers, developers know that ipads are the biggest revenue source, so it's important to figure out where everyone is contributing to tech spending growth. that's why the shows at apple's annual developer conference usually end in a speed bump last year, when smaller numbers of developers attending for a typical live gig show emerged unscathed. they cancelled altogether, selling out of tickets, other attendees started looking elsewhere or cut back on their efforts. ""they chose to isolate the success of the incredible star developer ecosystem from revenue,"" apple analyst mark gurman wrote in a blog post.

""there are several apple events within the year for ipad and iphone events,"" she said. ""you'll hear more about these events over the next few months. but to date, a great deal has been made about the way apple is managing various problems and enhancing the community. we're at an inflection point where we are working as a team and with our customers to engage and learn from them."" though gurman offered a suggestion to figure out if people were giving up on the ipad, or if they were running out of room for an idea to pop up with a better platform, anyone who has purchased apple products is likely to be surprised. one of the biggest selling points of the ipad has been its ease of use and safety. apple released the ipad air the week before apple opened its new icloud service to developers, and apple chief executive tim cook responded by talking about how much more safe and up-to-date the company's main product is now. though the ipad pro is considerably better at making photography better, the pro doesn't hold its own against what apple is likely to gain by giving the ipad a stylus that can actually mimic a photo — but if the ipad pro can help the position, it could make it a little more palatable to families. let's say users don't live in california and live near apple, which has new ipads in every market in the world in 2019. they'll be able to take an apple tv and watch videos, chat with apple speakers and use their ipads or tablets as plug-ins for tvs and more. according to mckinsey & company, the lower-cost ipad pro offers buyers a cut in the initial costs of cloud services. that, or it could cost anywhere from $200 to $400 less to $499. copyright 2019 by cnn newsource. all rights reserved. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.",grover

(that's a problem, because i used to play video games and watch movies online every day, but i hardly make a dent in online storage.) determining where to look for accurate information is a difficult process, and people increasingly are relying on live-streaming services that typically start in foreign locations and last from a distant family or religion. the examples here include the viral games with games, which has streamed live-streaming christian prayer services at the world's most-popular festivals (such as saint peter's in the jewish quarter of jerusalem and the ghetto visitor in buenos aires) and the walker qq service, which also streams online. and according to the washington post, global internet watch estimates that 34 countries have services dedicated to palestinian religious organizations, as it reports. the figures are based on tracking visits to the services by 23,000 people worldwide, the online giant's data shows. it's not surprising that such services are popular in some countries: seven of the nine countries are leading asia and europe in membership in the world internet day for electronic religious media (wtop) worldwide, and 73 countries have applied, according to the report. the poll of 62 countries came to pew's conclusion that 68 percent of those who are internet users are religious believers (that is, they follow the faiths of others on the internet). more than half of those who are internet users still participate on a regular basis – with 60 percent of younger u.s. internet users — and the median age of those who are internet users is under 20, with 32 percent of ages 18 to 29 among them. but when asking people what religion they belong to, 25 percent of those older than 20 said ""christian."" there's a strong sense of religious pluralism in conversations, and that two-thirds of those online use a religious site. the data shows that the sites increasingly have come under increasing scrutiny – and has stirred new concerns about the digital sexting habits of companies engaged in sexual conduct in order to get or maintain youth demographic attention.

""we now have to see this through, and try to make the debate for an informed one about how this is affecting all of us."" for how long may this wait? the pew report found that the u.s. social security administration might see an uptick in the number of religiously-affiliated bodies affected by the rsvp pandemic. that would make it one of the few surveillance strategies with upside. still, it's a big deal for two reasons: it will reduce the amount of time individuals spend looking for religious services in their own locale and reduce the potential vulnerability of religious sites. for churches and synagogues, the political concerns arising from the pandemic leave them baffled. even more troubling than giving a loved one a phone call is having him or her profile on another religious site.

""i was actually away from the web when we came here,"" mccue joked. ""it is paradise!"" the creative team behind bumble bee reads on the instagram post that: ""we've been to exotic new places like mexico and hong kong and they're all fabulous places,"" that ""when you visit one of these places you're away from everything you love,"" that ""when you visit one of these places you're away from everything you love"" and that ""restaurants can be so hard to find, but bumble bee will be the freshest and healthy combination.""

334,"BMW redesigns its iconic logo bmw officially changed its logo from original 1962 in all those years of being a member of the supercar world, first as a member of the baupost group and then as a member of the parent company of the f1 team. the past appears to have rested on a change in the work of vw to build out one icon while traveling the globe, forcing many other companies to make changes. the model has been modified for a tastier hue to emphasize movement and reflections over calligraphy, and it adds a more contemporary look to its signature paint design. like the baupost group. tix there are a lot of changes in bmw, so the redesign may help ease some of the undercurrents created by the baupost group as it enters its first tranche of big-league design projects. back in 2006, 10 years after signing a u.s. agreement with audi, bmw named it the ""primary line,"" meaning ""voyager."" initially, that phrase meant ""the mission and the purpose of bmw is to, by and with the people and agents that drive vehicles, lead the society to a better future,"" according to the company's website. now, the badge icon is not a flag, but rather a form of self-expression: a place for on-the-road experiences where customers would get to see and hear the vision and experience of their lives if they drove a bmw. as such, bmw plans to alter the look of its cars after an initial update as soon as it is possible to get behind the wheel. ""the main change to the bmw products in 2017 was to take on more, more and more of the car's realisation, thus increasing the level of relevance of the product and its ownership,"" bmw said in a statement. ""also in the past, this company had a series of brand changes that caused them to change further its identity and in recent years we have been shown in the most recent development cycle to change its overall identity so that it can be more recognized in the eyes of customers."" the departure of roger hargrove was an essential shift, and a statement from bmw reiterated the company's other decisions to focus on more technological aspects of the production car. another adjustment, with the introduction of an adaptive wing mirror in 2016, involved merging bmw's signature features with the offerings of its digital signage. among the upgrades, the lightness of the headlights, for example, and a number of other changes, include standard body and wing tail lights, as well as a wider ""full-up moonroof"" featuring fog lamps, a more upright backview and a narrow rear wheel-drive.",grover

346,"9 things that will make flying on an airplane better there are some basic problems flying in the airplane — cabin smell, probably. in 2014, an faa representative sent us our first flight plans since the 777x. we were on a long, busy flight that included an active passenger on board for approximately 30 minutes and the rest was just before the nose-rubber popped the cabin door. of course, that got us talking — and some important recommendations, too. now, why should you be concerned about your seatbelt? how about the seat, right? whenever one of these contraptions performs great things, you'll have a myriad of reasons to be concerned. a car's driver — who takes in less than a third of the amount of traffic in a plane — can't keep up. even though it's all in the cockpit, there are some inherently dangerous controls that hurt your soul and probably don't help it at all. 1. your legs. shoving around arms that can bend them hurts your heart a little, but the chance of it making you turn into a 360 mask is slim to none. if you're testing your legs out, you shouldn't put them on your legs as much as you're giving them to help you pull around your plane. if you can find something in your chest that makes you feel good, go for it. 2. your head. bystanders need to be reasonable and specific in their suggestions, and you need to take those safe measures. at a recent briefing in the scottsdale airport, our transportation security administration officer came up with an ingenious way to bring over a security line in advance of a flight. he pointed to a chair position behind your head. i grabbed my phone to make sure there were no guards at the right height — not two at least — so that we could see in advance that there was an officer behind us. 3. the added weight of your cargo. with a body load of tons and loads of bags, and probably hundreds of people flying in the same period, some people just can't fit on the plane. thus, a thick transfer material like the trunk lining helps lighten weight on the armrest, removing the weight off the flying inks and re-stripping it away. 4. you're all riding in a new seat. the lack of bodies required to perform in an airplane is a problem, but the added weight makes it hard to seat more than half of all passengers, every one of them, on their seats. 5. you're allergic to oxygen. too many people in a flying system allergic to oxygen. if a plane is forced to stop working before landing, that infrequency of food in the seats is a number that will be significantly reduced. 6. your behavior. sometimes there are passengers that meet the same kind of special needs. for example, an international student who enjoys walking to and from school. or a person who's good at yoga, but might want to know how to get out of a plane to learn how to express themselves, or a person who has inherited a form of cancer. 7. you don't know when you should stop. basically, people who do well on their sick days get in trouble — but they don't realize they're going to be trapped for as long as they can. they never realize they're made to fly by the government. 8. you have a fear of safety. if you are experiencing a moment of extreme trauma — a sudden knock on the door, for example — or when your job has become too important to you, if you're driving for 24 hours, you are going to want to get out of there. without a step, they're not going to have what they need. 9. you have to wear seat belts. if you're starting to stumble over yourself, part of the solution is to wear a seat belt, but the more people you have on the plane, the better. getting them off the plane sometimes requires watching some tv — but the money is good too.",grover
347,"The best travel photos of 2020 so far photo: auxpeolar.jpg london (cnn) — these images were sent in the wake of the election of donald trump as president of the united states. that includes an interview with french sociologist jean-louis churin and a batch of french-argentinian photos he sent to trump jr. some believe that he somehow convinced trump to support wikileaks for a secret ""surveillance"" operation, according to french journalists who have taken part in the selection process. nevertheless, those images should be of concern to anyone following the debate about the cia's involvement in the 2016 campaign. that's the biggest challenge facing intelligence analysts, whose job is to catch journalists who might try to steal information or otherwise undermine those organisations. a trial-and-error process is where some have sought advice from france's existing intelligence archives, and it takes time to work around lengthy records. that can get complicated. cnn had twice asked for photos of three different presidential elections during this decades' transition. no pictures were taken in france. the resulting series of portraits calls to mind what may be french interests now. by that, i mean how the elections might have played out as the time goes on. but there also seems to be confusion about the now. trump jr. apparently seemed anxious to show off his new comradery as long as it would ensure his future — and not a single amount of money. whether trump has a large inheritance on his side, he's very excited about the possibility. by contrast, the most important photo on the right is of the corrupt mayor and his current heir apparent, gianni versace. one of the president's ambassadors, seif el-erian, is busy consolidating his influence, which is seen as an antidote to the personage of gianni versace, brother of versace. who he is pros, he may be a stern and fiery character of his own time, but gianni versace is a ne'er-do-well of an architect, whose biography is unimpressive, if not off-putting, as it seemed to a lot of americans following the election of trump. his massive wealth is not seen as a revelation, it is seen as something of a mistranslation. impressed with gianni versace sati lucia in full: his carnegie marten, on paper: surrounded by historians and lawyers: in contrast to his coronation wife, which he described to the editor as ""psychological"" and was described as ""corrupt and boring,"" gianni has an impeccable proclivity for losing. why did he propose to the palais royale with his mother? the cover page — commissioned from a magazine for magazines in which the owner worked, gianni — was allegedly written by a catholic nun, who wore a long dress for his weekly pubic hairband. only the ""professionals"" are mentioned, but gianni already moved across territory with his idea of an investment banker who would become the future president of france and then of russia. how did trump jr. develop his worldview? by dangling the money to either hillary clinton or donald trump jr. how did he aim for his communications manager to be questioned about his business dealings? by asking, ""if you can make the cia take a more credible stance on this, how can you convince the cia not to prosecute you?"" favourite hopperreits brothers the 6ft 23in daughters were in an affluent london suburb when they were stolen in a burglary. a friend of the sisters told the financial times that the thieves read them the double-book subscription in the fine collection and decided on using it to buy a car and raise the alarm. this is something that friends on the isle of wight will be keen to know, but with gianni being is he inclined to think hard about that because if it does happen he is a political figure. robinson and tranter the pair are a favoured combination. robinson and tranter used to help secure the transfer of somalian pirate leaders from the country to the u.s. so that they could export their naval victory to libya and also fought pirates in the caribbean. but the brothers are not happy with the u.s. presence, and they do not want the u.s. to stop from supplying the people of some countries and undermining their struggle. the no. 1 goal, they argue, is to bring back the local coastguard, and to prevent the navy from taking hold in these increasingly tense seas. i mention that because it is not limited to marine species.",grover
348,"Private jets are taking off because of coronavirus most americans now have trouble catching at least one or two coronavirus incidents because they can't catch the correct one, and for some reason they're righting that wrong, experts say. in fact, another third of americans, only about 2.5 percent, might have a breathing problem from breathing on a private jet, according to research conducted by the national air traffic controllers association. read more about this story from national air traffic controllers association ""conventional coronavirus testing conducted in 1990 is suspect and unusual,"" said robert bianchi, president of the association. ""the air carrier safety team is not performing 'safer' tests in its areas."" the association believes it may have made an error, but not likely. the aircraft manufacturer has an air carrier safety and accident assessment and detection strategy. the air carrier safety and accident assessment and detection system monitors aircraft based on air traffic patterns and the type of aircraft used to perform the tests. this leads to that first indicator: how fast is a jet coming? that's followed by the speed at which the aircraft has approached that speed and other signs of breaking airworthiness and safety standards, bobby wolf, a spokesman for boeing aircraft's scientific and technical consulting group, told cnn. since 2013,, the number of incidents of an airborne coronavirus has quadrupled, from 3,961 in 2012 to more than 21,000 in 2017, according to the national air traffic controllers association. the average wait time for an air carrier to evaluate a flight is 30 minutes, according to the association. the air carrier safety and accident assessment and detection plan is reviewed by the aviation safety board and air traffic control and network enforcement units and overseen by a school bus escort, wolf said. bianchi said coronavirus cases appear to be occurring in mid-air but in ""random"" waves. he said coronavirus exposure may occur as the plane comes in contact with a traveling companion's stomach. ""typically pilots look in first, second and third floor, which could be an individual taking hold of the seat,"" bianchi said. ""there could be a body strain."" bianchi said this happens routinely in other planes used to operate commercial aircraft, including helicopters. the maximum safety level for aircraft is 500, according to air methods, an air force air-safety practice organization, which certifies and evaluates its pilots and pilots through questions about air quality and safety. among the planes involved in the largest coronavirus cases, both live and depart aircraft, are boeing's q400x, which contains more than 50,000 pounds of melon, according to the association. the flying party knows that picking up passengers who are near or within the ""middle"" of a flight, on a commercial business trip, has good aviation safety, but few of them know the fire that causes symptoms of coronavirus before they notice it. bianchi told cnn the airline industry is an effort to preserve ""the risk that a passenger is going to die."" according to the association, more than 20 separate coronavirus cases have happened in 2016 alone. last year, mcdonnell douglas, maker of the a319 jetliner, reported a 99.5 percent chance of an airborne coronavirus. a diagnosis was given to an aircraft operator who was 65-plus years old and was ""extremely unwell.""

349,"A bipartisan Buttigieg effect? The people of this gorgeous island country say yes iowa, the land of beer and brisk northern californian backdrops, must be one of the toughest places in the country to live. it's also among the most famous, arguably the world's toughest, with a plentiful number of people crowded around in search of a place to settle, work or vacation in the middle of the desert. but the truth is that ""tribes"" of writers and musicians who populate the willows' solarium have found a way to pass as well, its feel more accurately defined by geography. the willows is supposed to be a picolutination of the ohio coastline, but many people do not know about it. chris kotlikoff, better known for tackling real life issues in that late july sketch trump's life might unravel, about 47 minutes in, stood in the freezing rain as he reflected on the news about what ""to do"" if congress won't cave in to republican demands, $4 trillion in tax cuts and a massive infrastructure bill. it wasn't just a ""who says, we shouldn't do it"" moment for kotlikoff — he made one, too. he played the president of the united states, insisting that trump ""deserve to be put back to work and make a difference in society."" in his video, kotlikoff welcomes reporters to the space. he takes us to town, past a group of veterans living off houses. he has drinks — as the one there demonstrates with plenty of wisdom — and can hear them chatting in the gallery. they all are english, or likely to be, and stand a bit, like the bad boys, about to unwind, two of the sisters in the baby fuchsia outfit. kotlikoff tells the crowd, ""you don't need to have a photo op with a special agent, or a shot of gold barks in the air — you need not need a photographer; you need pictures. so just — once you're here, when you get to the other side of town, take pictures of it all around you — so if there's anybody, you can point your rifle to it and if he does not, you need to ask."" ""you don't need a picture op to reengage in politics,"" kotlikoff adds, with his somewhat quippy tone, taking shots at senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, who reminded the crowd that, as the willows' host, kotlikoff is the full stopover from politics. again, he's a canadian, meaning one of the world's richest and most sought-after hosts. he's a politician, and he's got as much going on as he does at his offices. he doesn't speak new slang, but he knows a thing or two about places that serve as a metaphor, a place that at some points reminds you, too, of a place you can return to someday. in general, he does at least as well with press shots as he does with video. as kotlikoff sits in on cnn, telling us how he felt about the weather, you might be forgiven for missing it. the sky with plenty of greening is an interesting measurement for the position of the sun in the sky (both, of course, if you ever take a land cruiser in this state), but what really matters is the place you visit. and the potential of being in that place might become compelling enough. a couple months ago, washington's capital was heading in a new direction. washington, oh, so awash in money and progressives, but it should be a place of optimism that the political zeitgeist could be swung back into action. a long list of new ideas is about to take shape, and big questions are being made about what's needed to wake the country up to the political system being feckless. what's needed is a half-rotten, people-powered approach to government. not even all-star politics would be able to give it that realism. the price of freedom is going to come down.",grover

""as a young guy who traveled the world for an adventure, i spent a lot of time in argentina and chile while my father went to chile, making the wine,"" he says. ""when my parents came back, we started making the wine in argentina. it was a fantasy to see the wine as something that was very natural."" lavocel grew up a big fan of wine grapes, especially grapes growing in peru, which he first visited at the beginning of the year and saw the vineyards of tavecchio and don echoc, who both started this was their last. ""my father proposed to me that i should come and be friends with the young people who started growing grapes,"" he recalls. ""we discussed the decision. and we realized that you start the step-by-step process of making the wine with less pressure."" beginning with an annual tasting, which he started with tavecchio, he was introduced to some of his favorite flavors of fruits and herbs, like the red cherries and tulips of mexico and pinot noir, and then a lot of the grape varieties of his hometown that he grew in the years since. after that he began to train in wine making. much of the food he made in paraguay, puerto rico and uruguay took some time to make and his love for the wine world and labels he learned came from his upbringing and travels as a child. ""i remember the little sour apples i got from paraguay and the special old films with robert de niro and líros peron,"" lavocel says. ""and then i also came across a beautiful wine from spain and i thought, you know what, that's my name. and i wanted to share with my family from it, that the scent of fresh cherries and vinaigrette would carry my wine to give a change of direction. so i started and started making wine for a simple reason."" after a lengthy, tasting of the wines, lavocel made the final two bottles for his cousin to add to the family. ""then we started to have happy memories of it and of sharing it with everyone, and of how it tasted,"" he says. ""and also of the beginning of the process, my cousin came and picked up his grapes and tried them. and he happened to be one of the great wine makers in south america, that's what i am seeing right now."" while it takes two years of competing, blending, mastering and refining the grape varieties of his native land to make these wines, he ended up winning one of the biggest prizes in south america, the 2010 world record for keeping food sakes. this is because he cut a special sauvignon blanc to account for the growing pours of uruguayan grapes that started for south america, and used them in the recipe for making the wine of life.

""what these animals are being forced to eat is going to be difficult for them to find food and other undisturbed, nourished creatures that are so nutritious,"" compton said. people will also have to endure some new challenges to make it out of the jungle, without a full-blown tourist experience from the park.

""the era is saturated and modern and traditional on the center, and now really foreign heads of industry come to the area. there are people who come to do business in sweden every year and they have great idea,"" topelinka said. topelinka said senior employees are understood to visit the high rise in downtown st. helena and believe everyone they meet is from sweden. the resorts are shown to have plush interior areas. hotel rocha has a bathroom beneath the blue-clad diners on the ground floor, staffed by chefs trying to replicate the welcoming vibe of the city's restaurant scene. the hotel itself has designed natural wood flooring, matched by lush gardens and colorful carpeting. topelinka said at the holidays, stockholm has enough hotels and resorts to support the same type of lifestyle as dublin. this reflects the city's interest in creating a memorable visitor experience, in a unique and impressive way. ""but we do offer different things from the hotel world. for example, stockholm is usually two-days away and stockholm has basically a day-and-a-half, two-hour walk from your hotel. there are no swiss's — it's just a bit slower, not very competitive in the market.""",grover

""i would like to stress that i have spoken with my health secretary about the report that the british medical association publishes with regards to the accusation that i may have contracted the coronavirus, the one that was really passed to me personally, and that it is a false statement."" johnson has been in the public eye ever since he told reporters at the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, last month that he was ill with the dangerous virus. he said in a lengthy letter that he began experiencing ""a very low rate of sleep"" two weeks ago, because of fatigue from the trip. he said he experienced mild headache and difficulty breathing while in the ambulance, while was stitched together. the infection was suspected in early february while in brazil with his wife. health experts at the time said that the presence of the virus was not conclusive enough to confirm that johnson had contracted the virus. a second source — a person whose symptoms have included weakness, confusion, severe vertigo, and suffering from acute intoxication — has also become ill after arriving in london. doctors said their operations could have resulted in further infections — the source has yet to be determined — but they also said they believed they would not have contracted the virus since his symptoms had not been noticeable at the time of the trip. johnson told the press association in march that he was taking steps to protect himself from the virus. capping an hour-long news conference on thursday, he said: ""the only conclusion i can draw as a person is that i should be taken more seriously because i know how much (my medical troubles) have contributed to this particular tragedy and that is why it is necessary that we act now."" he added that ""if i can get away with it, even if i mean it"" he was ""not going to get me back into the crowd."" campaigners have been increasingly calling for action against british health ministers and health insurance companies over the investigation, claiming their response to allegations from the bma was biased. the new labour party government of jeremy corbyn is facing questions over its handling of the scandal, which has led to weeks of claims that ministers were secretly involved in failing to give evidence to parliament. the foreign office said it had received all of the 100odd official misconduct complaints sent by the health select committee. johnson said he understood that the bma has informed him ""all the time"" that its investigation would focus on whether there was a broader pattern of failures in the industry. but he added: ""my mind is clear now: no other member of government ever is going to take the fight to the media and press who allege the wrongdoing of my ministers. ""i understand what is going on now. but i am not going to act to make them lie.""",grover

Now vigilantes are threatening the welcomers (cnn) — women fleeing life-threatening conditions are flocking to remote mountains and ziplines, rescuing people in low-grade ice and in often intense heat before returning to the villages or rivers that feed their push towards the world's most dangerous and impassable places. at a sweltering munich, sweden's modern equivalent of the arctic circle, about 1,300 people in croatia are scheduled to leave croatia for switzerland, but only about half of them are physically enough to travel far enough for crossing the river into austria and switzerland, according to the migrant-refugee crisis center international rescue committee. what's more, despite international aid organizations' desire to address the issue, more than 2,600 people have managed to go since september — still more than half as many did a year ago — with dozens still too exhausted to try to get across, icrc said. ""the challenge is continuing to rise at a rate similar to the number of european migrants, since the situation on the ground, including in some of the ziplines, is not fully democratic,"" said peter gabriel, head of the icrc. sections of central and eastern europe will be affected by the scaling back of winter aid deliveries to some of the region's poorest eastern europe, said gabriel. according to an indian official, 250 people have arrived this week in germany and 300 in hungary. traveling expenses the icrc estimates the economic impact of the tightened aid shakedown efforts in central and eastern europe will be worth a minimum of 10 million euros ($12.5 million) over the next two years, while humanitarian group doctors without borders estimates the cost could be up to three times higher. the icrc worries that more than 2,300 people have set foot across the route from slovenia to austria in the last year, crossing from the nordic country's volatile border with austria and slovenia. ""from austria we were at about 6,000 euros per day, about 10,000 euros in the last year, and this period is going to increase,"" gabriel said. ""they're going to have to take even more desperate measures, not the least of which, because we are under-construction in hungary, or in many cases belarus, so we're seeing further straining on the infrastructure of hungary to build the borders."" after months of talks with the communist governments of austria and slovenia, the international organization for migration has advised hungary to distance itself from smugglers. german authorities launched an investigation and foreign ministry spokeswoman urrike giordano called the icrc's human-rights report ""textbook."" their fears are echoed by falun gong practitioners in hungary, who also await final decisions on who will bear responsibility for the human misery inflicted on their adherents. sobriety, stress meanwhile, migrant arrivals have increased. more than 500 passengers have managed to safely cross the icy border between hungary and austria since september and 2,200 have crossed into italy since that date, with others landing in berlin and several moving to austria and germany for their own benefit. officials say they're monitoring the situation closely, but there is a ""high risk"" of additional migrants landing at the border and making it through via bulgaria or macedonia if they are in hungary. hundreds are expected to make the crossing, and a ""call-out"" warning has been issued for the two balkan countries. one turkish official says the country is already considering asking for the rest of the migrants to stay. ""these figures are true of every other country, but we need to see a real and moral risk to be a part of the global plan to help people in the hard times,"" gabriel said. yvo leipold, deputy chairman of the un high commissioner for refugees, said at a conference here thursday that ""i hope that 2018 marks the beginning of a new era of refugee arrivals."" some are fighting in europe to get out or get back to their home countries. in the arctic circle, a relentless flow of up to 4,000 people by the thousands has spread throughout central and eastern europe and has prompted predictions of a ""second migration wave."" but media reports on monday express a different prediction: at least 15,000 migrants won't be inside hungary or austria if the authorities fail to reroute those attempting to reach europe.",grover

""it's not an (election) decision, and a promise is not simply. it's an attitude,"" putin said. ""i'm glad we can now consolidate this relationship,"" he said. but putin also defended us-russia relations in general. ""we are an alliance which is not just a bilateral relation, but one in which our two national interests are always central,"" he said. putin said the present push for change is a recognition that for the trump administration, the 2016 election was a classic case of the trump effect. ""the manipulation of the electoral system has been accelerated by people who, to a great extent, saw not only the election outcome but also by trump,"" he said. notably, the kremlin says it has reached out to its partners and allies to try to support the proposal, which putin says is being aimed at hitting the ""threaten"" of the americans' expulsion from the united states. putin also gave praise to trump's counterterrorism adviser, michael flynn, whom he says was critical of the us government in syria. but putin found some of his praise to be rather petty, accusing flynn of lying about his conversations with trump. ""i say very forcefully that, in the very first in the process, flynn lied about having these conversations,"" putin said. putin also questioned whether russia had to pay for those sessions. ""i find it perfectly clear that there have been exceptions."" but putin and other world leaders also accused the trump administration of fabricating evidence to justify its crackdown on journalists, including trump's former national security adviser, michael flynn. ""my explanation is that these were decisions made by the american administration and — such as the informality [here] — they happen to fit the worldview of the president of the united states,"" putin said. ""trump has exhibited in many ways what he has said all along the last few days."" clinton had said trump's repeated calls for the withdrawal of us troops from syria last month ""deserve the same degree of scrutiny as what's happened here."" but it was trump's campaign adviser, rudy giuliani, who said in an interview with nbc that trump's campaign had been ""pretty inconsistent."" he also challenged putin's assertion that the situation at the summit has improved.

""we wouldn't think that after every children have fever, they can start remembering symptoms and keeping up with them and keeping them safe,"" she says. if vogelbaugh, nobley and a group of third-graders can increase the rates of catching the symptoms, it could be the biggest pre-school need. and it just might save some of the remaining kids from having to go through the misery. if that happens, vogelbaugh and the child-and-family of three wise girls have two more children in the school year. they will get married after school in september. and when the woman sees them, she'll choose them for their wedding, not getting married. copyright 2019 by cnn newsource. all rights reserved. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.",grover

The story behind Taiwan's newest airline, STARLUX all aboard the rebel jet, a commercial version of the russian starliner, which could be tested sometime in the near future. the latest name-change is a slice of taiwanese, our largest carrier, whose unveiling at the weekend is even more intriguing. the company is known for their standard fare like k-rates, and for bringing along carrier carriers like china's dalian airlines for the long haul. as japanese papers here are known, china is admittedly a flight shy of international traffic. unlike most of the international carriers in its sphere, z-jet has come to resemble a civilian passenger carrier, courtesy of the built-in cameras that shoot x-rays and 24-x7 intelligence and medical imagery. while china's 10-year-old starjet has operated in just 25 cities — well fewer than a dozen of the vietnamese counterparts — it has made that feat less surprising with starline. they've been flying up to taiwan for one year. ""the starliner will follow suit in 2020, and perhaps 2021 or 2022,"" lead corporate development manager wang chiong told euro pacific dispatch. ""it will be for independent passengers,"" he added. with traditional business tourism cranking out an estimated 35 billion yuan ($6.29 billion) in turnover annually, starlux offers an idea of how many independent travelers taiwan has to offer. ""there is so much easy connectivity. the starliner fleet will be very easy to maintain,"" shen peng, idfa head of airline business at starlux, told the asian website. it's the first example of taiwan's aviation industry practicing entrepreneurialism — something just ever since the country's communist tsar was deposed and established the country's first carrier, inn. but the at&t deal handed control of the state-run airline to a private company, altair, which was privatized four years ago. altair let starline do the selling and provides free flights, something only within the country. the hope is a similar business model is set up in the country's next generation of carriers — one that uses video-ready equipment like cameras and eye-tracking to provide security to passengers in the security stage. according to idfa, the pilot tax would be 43.3 percent, for a private carrier that's allowed to carry up to two aircraft (lj 120) in any given year. bottom line: an entrepreneur from a hit show to get into the direct flight business doesn't hold together just in terms of technical innovation. there's going to be more customer competition because starline seems like a shareholder, compared to other carriers. in may, china-based lj has agreed to sell its assets to national starline holding ltd. and takes over starliner group flightworks. new york-based starlux recently secured a three-year carrier agreement with china's largest airline, taiex airlines. the relationship, which marks the first time starliner has held a pilot pilot license, makes an affiliate airline subsidiary in the country the parent company of starliner airlines. among other things, starlux operates in china alongside chinese carriers neng power and guwahati aviation. a qantas carrier, qantas joins the starlux fleet sometime this year. starline airlines has 62 domestic flights, with 116 international flights at the moment. its international flights are operated by hong kong airlines virgin china and vosiors international. but this isn't the first time starline has entered the international aviation market. in 2011, starline launched its premium x-ray escort service, starflight china, with an eye toward lucrative international airlines. it has since deployed a fleet of eight boeing 737 and one airbus a380 aircraft in passenger flight.",grover

Mountain air after several long bouts of leukemia, brain cancer and pneumonia, jesus diaz had a new medical diagnosis. a cavernous but noxious, 10-year-old boy's lungs were leaking blood. his disease had widened beyond the outer walls of the wall and had been the foundation of his life. the b-map from the sixth doctor's manual on lung transplantation identifies the secrets to the long life of black lung from research in the 1930s, which showed only lung clones in central regions of italy. z. sebastian welcel told travelkeeper how he spotted drugs from a near alien world in the 1960s and in the 1970s with the help of university of california, san diego aerospace engineer charles early. welcel's illness gradually died out in favor of an adolescence that allowed him to mix the pursuit of culture with medications to decrease side effects. in the end, welcel and fellow lander chris helene discovered that melanoma and lung cancer are not of the same sex. but that doesn't mean they can be just biopsies. ""that's the predicament, in your life,"" he told travelkeeper. although rumors about the secret help of cocaine suggest that cocaine power in sixties may have been widely misapplied during the 20th century to treat other diseases, welcel says there was no credible cause for the buildup in front of some of his body. ""i can say that indeed, it was not anything or any one drug,"" he told travelkeeper. in the 1980s, a software engineer by training at princeton university and black knight, who passed away in 1999, discovered that crack cocaine could kill tumors by coating muscle tissue with a different kind of silicon coating, which simultaneously was an alkali substance. the drug might have killed cancer cells in the cloned cells, but it lacked the same effect on other organs. it wasn't available for use in cancer surgery, welcel says. ""so in some way these drugs do not fit the mold, that's my main problem."" still, he says, ""rigorous treatment from time to time is much better than a hospital stay at a dying patient, and often effective treatment,"" welcel said. references to genetic pollution don't mean that a vaccine's effects, too, have reached mainstream; do we really need it? of course not. ""you know, there are certain control techniques that give you the ability to give your own immune system protection over time. you're relying on genes that support that innate immunity that feeds off all sorts of other organisms, whether it's bacteria that test their sense of health in their bodies or worms that fight pests, so if you want to control your own immune system, you need to have good genetics as well."" welcel and his friends bruce thomson, david goulding and neil o'neill found the underlying secret behind cell death in the 1950s and 1960s. their research allowed them to induce about 200 conventional tests in people with two illnesses each. without such protection from smearing, theologics found that non-experts could be mistakenly ""born with the germicide of salmonella and/or mescaline,"" as colleagues called it. that much germicide was largely reduced. not all cancers are caused by certain chemicals from other sources. but most tumours grow their tumours in cells outside of one of those chemists' control centers, and some cancers that seem to fizzle out with a wash of a stem cell becomes a thousandfold tumor. for example, only two classes of cancer cells in the family that only grow outside of one person's control center are usually found in person.",grover

""i simply can't cook in paris. the phrase 'room for food, for service' is one of those moments in life, a moment to experience somebody else in depth."" the chef also said that ""unless you are a cynic, you'll find something in paris where you don't think things will improve overnight."" i spent years working for a number of legendary chefs like roux, giorgio armani, bon appetit, angelo scola, carlo faria, pierre bernardini, jack valenti, pierre eustache, rosemary vigen, and many others. roux was among the unsung heroes who helped shatter hollywood's film worlds. throughout his career, he won numerous awards for the role of ruthless chef crédit du mommas, or ""master of the naughties."" he also competed for numerous international awards for his contributions to popular culture, including being nominated for an academy award for ""call it zakat."" the cook raised awareness about feeding the hungry, had years of charity work to help poor children and disabled people, and even turned his life around on a hunger strike to protest the reduction of soup sales to supermarkets. photos of roux's wife of 34 years, elisabeth, passed away in 2005, leaving him with an estimated estimated worth of $250 million. on facebook and twitter, the names of many of roux's heroes were shared and shared over the years. roux was one of the most admired chefs in the world in the late 1980s.

""when you make the ultimate gender inequality game, it's like, 'fuck you!'"" she said. ""and that's in and of itself racist."" rapinoe, a u.s. olympian and former wall street journal economics editor, was among a dozen women who accompanied head coach jill ellis, recently thrust into the national spotlight after revelations that she once sent players teary-eyed on social media about being coached by bill donohue. sean jansen, chairman of the canadian soccer federation, told reporters that his country will alter its mental and physical screening procedures for its sport before matches in the next several weeks. jansen said canadian officials will send letters to players informing them of the change, while an american technical director is expected to be in place for every soccer match. players in english, the most popular sport in the us, have to be checked at home for signs of foul play or bodily harm, while american officials will run anti-doping tests as well, which rapinoe described as ""a whole game changer."" after u.s. soccer's last international match in toronto on november 23, 2015, rapinoe tweeted: ""i wake up every day like, 'no, i'm really sick. nothing can bring me back.' i wake up like, 'i'm really sick. i'm really sick.'

383,"Ohio governor explains why he closed all schools ohio governor john kasich on monday decided to ""work all year with the students"" to close the schools until possible legislation to prevent ""scheduling conflicts"" at other schools is implemented. kasich clarified the move when he addressed the ohio chamber of commerce. kasich recalled that he opened three different schools in the state prior to the 2008-09 school year. these were convocations, presidential retreats, and lectures for ""unfettered access"" by non-native speakers. ""our governor has decided to leverage all of these lessons, as he articulated to us in 2016, for the school closings ... in 2014,"" kasich said monday during an event at the ohio school debate center in parma. ""if if you close any more, this one you will do,"" he told the audience before switching gears and asking them if they supported closing any school or programs. for nearly two decades, kasich has pursued opening all of the schools. the only president who allowed those closures was george w. bush. kasich didn't directly address whether he still holds that view, but did say he continues to believe a closing of the school would never happen. ""that's all going to happen and even if it ever happens ... in the states of ohio that you talk about, we're going to re-think things and we are going to re-evaluate the opportunities that are open to us,"" he said. ""and that's what's really driving us to have these choice decisions, the choices that we want them to be open ... we want them available to everyone,"" kasich said. at the april 2013 commencement ceremony for michigan's university of wisconsin's paul t. ashe school of law, kasich made clear that michigan's lawsuit against the state is a ""very serious issue"" and the case is set to become a hot item in the 2016 presidential campaign. ""and if we need one more way, if we need another way, we are going to come forward to come forward and we are going to fight with all our will,"" kasich said. kasich said ohio has roughly 30,000 law schools. of those, he believes 67 to 79 will be hit with the statewide or statewide closings, while the remainder will be shuttered. he explained the closed schools would mostly be closing school day operations, similar to schools with a larger campus, such as the southeastern ohio university school of law in saginaw, and many more smaller. and he cited the four-year project he had with wachovia to purchase the principal's and custodian's properties and to take them out of office areas. the state has increased capital investment for the school districts, and for the businesses that will be closed, kasich said. ""i also think our revenue was very much sustainable,"" he said. kasich also addressed two of the reasons he closed dozens of schools: ""one, there is less mobility. you know how there is with school days and there was a, i think, an undue anxiety about time times that children don't have a second break that feels like they're coming into full-time employment,"" he said. the other reason he closed 50 schools is, ""some schools just won't be closed anymore,"" he said. ""and therefore our schools are going to be closed,"" he said. ""because of the tuition and fees and other things of that nature, there's not so much – there's not at the school level, either. and we're talking about really, really important projects that will build a successful institution, and there's going to be educational programs,"" he said.",grover

""today, i'm confident that the eu's bedrock partners, greece and turkey, have approved this latest development of negotiations to sign a full-fledged project to liberalize the european union into a truly free trade zone under two million strong,"" the eu official said in a statement, adding that the group would continue to seek an alternative. yildirim has been ill since the two-day eu-turkey summit on friday saw the usually vigorous opposition represented in the european parliament and others who led the charge to push his candidacy for prime minister. earlier tuesday, turkish foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu said: ""in the summer's international community there will be a free movement of people; in the summer's international community there will be not even free movement of people."" it remains unclear how turkey would react to what it sees as a violent crackdown after prime minister binali yildirim finally rejected an eu offer to host the 1 million turkish hryvnia (1.3 billion euros) aid package. akseddin demirtas, the executive director of the turkish media institute, said despite turkish concerns that the deal has not yet been fully implemented, it remains a point of hope. ""for the turkish people, this is a potential hostage for the deal that we are seeking as a whole,"" demirtas said. to try to contain the eu, ankara had adopted a common language with the european union that highlights challenges. but this would not have allowed for turkey to negotiate directly with the eu, dealing a blow to its eu-brokered aims. relations between the eu and turkey soured sharply after turkey blamed its terrorist groups for the chaos in the south. erdogan blamed ethnic kurds for the strife, trying to undermine popular anger for next year's presidential election. turkey rejoined the european union as part of the 2015 deal but president donald trump opposed the move, insisting it will free up eu foreign policy. since then, erdogan has used his crackdown on protest and repression to seek the eu's blessing on a group of rebel factions running a rebel coalition in northern syria, threatening to bring war to turkey.",grover

395,"Louboutin wins fight to trademark red soles (cnn) — danish metal grinder and electronic super fan stefan louboutin beat out the other three competitors for the coveted red soles at the 2018 winter olympics. the 25-year-old austrian held off the doubles team of manchester native shawn sloss and german teaming stalwart toby kuhn to become the first professional male to triumph at a winter olympics. the gold medal was louboutin's second of the night after he won the bronze-medal victory over lithuania's yulia yaggin in the semis. he also won the bronze in men's alpine skiing last year. louboutin had his bronze medal in the men's single-pine skiing moguls crash on a snowy piste at st. moritz just a month before the olympic closing ceremony in pyeongchang. the gold and silver medal in the men's figure skating will play a big role for this year's winter olympics when the three medalists are announced in early october. louboutin received an update on his progress on thursday, tweeting out ""most important time"" after he'd raced his first road race of the season on friday. ""i think my first practice victory was probably around 3:40 p.m. in the morning,"" louboutin told the munich-based newspaper darmstadt zeitung. ""and by the third quarter i had broken my neck."" on wednesday, the 30-year-old tweeted out a ""thank you"" to world championships medalist jonas hojn at the rosa khutor alpine center in february. ""thank you to the russian team, joe olina [sebastian] and [tom] kronshild,"" louboutin wrote in a tweet. ""your healthy spirit made for an awesome moment. thanks for allowing me to have such an amazing run."" the austrian faces a tough task in this week's big meet, hosting a short track event at san jose in california at the weekend. sloss, whose pursuit of a maiden olympic gold medal in the women's skeleton won gold in the 2014 vancouver games, had a nasty fall during sunday's medal push, plunging to her knees and gasping for breath before being stung by louboutin's heels before returning to the track. ""this, my second start at the olympics, was a spectacular one,"" said sloss, who also raced his father ryan sloss to the 1924 salt lake city olympics. ""the success i've been enjoying this week and all the hard work i've put in throughout the season has helped me continue my development."" meanwhile, louboutin told darmstadt zeitung that he is still frustrated at missing a chance to compete at this year's olympics. ""it was really amazing,"" he said. ""i was surprised that i was at these olympics because you see so many upsets."" louboutin will take an advanced package from his father in his attempt to compete at pyeongchang, where his dad won the last four events. the austrian, who finished fourth at this year's baku winter games, is best known for his electronic style in tight pants and sporty caps, and has won gold medals at two of the events he competed at at the sochi olympics. louboutin's strong standing in the world of electronic music certainly wouldn't hurt louboutin, who just last week entered a record book with twenty new songs. louboutin's songs have been included on billboard's hot 100 countdown. he also recently landed on the concert soundtrack for the disney channel tv series ""flowers in the attic,"" about a singer-songwriter who gets hitched to his dreams. he tweeted about celebrating his feat on thursday.

396,"Netflix is worth more than Disney every year, data from entertainment websites like research in motion's research in motion ltd. and starz shows a correlation between the number of monthly netflix subscribers and the number of hulu subscriptions. is netflix like this? yep. the activity is quite random, though, and, really, what they show is over and over again. netflix's $40.1 billion in revenue at the end of last year was on par with disney's $47.3 billion in revenue. unlike most on-demand entertainment providers, netflix doesn't stop streaming content all the time. netflix also tracks subscriber engagement and demand; with netflix's first year's number of u.s. subscribers i'd consider an early indicator of engagement. netflix is already grappling with declining monthly user base, with subscriber costs increasing while streaming revenue is falling: about 25% growth from 2012 to 2017, to $1.2 billion. two of netflix's key sponsors, itunes and disney, recently announced a joint venture with apple. itunes is a digital music store offering content from artists like miley cyrus, ray charles, and many other artists. itunes said that streaming video on netflix and itunes is over 95% penetrated. all of this illustrates the one thing netflix could do differently. no matter how open we are to sharing our internet, simple information or snooping on our friends, the way we use our voice and screen is going to disappear. the tech companies that want to fight at-large control and censor content, do so in ways that benefit consumers. microsoft, google, amazon and the like are currently unable to do so, as a result of their stake in satellite tv distributor directv. they can't fully build any ""computers"" when those control groups aren't removed by the dmca. the far more worrisome tactic they're using might be to get their overly profitable cash cow out of the way. dish wants to kill that business model and grab 10% of the space in the whole pay-tv business. netflix is so effective at doling out such free tv content that some analysts believe the company could be on its way to being the dominant video content provider around the world, if not a satellite tv provider. there's a price to that: significantly less than apple and google could require such a truce. fortunately, the studios in attendance at this week's cinema conference are accustomed to this concession: netflix has also signaled that its content will also be marked down if it gains significant market share. netflix is more than just a streaming service that consists of massive data streams. it also manages the astonishing size of its subscriber base. since 2014, netflix has grown almost 13% from 58.6 million to 73.7 million. and, if this trend continues, as expected, the company's subscriber base should exceed 400 million by 2018. it's where we're going to see serious inflation over the next five years. netflix's move to crack the $30-per-month for streaming is a stroke of genius. consider that at the end of last year, 40% of its current subscribers streamed more than one service, so the company is shooting for 200 million monthly netflix subscribers in 2020. to put that number out there, you can't say the same for just netflix. it's not a singles or doubles market.",grover

419,"Your waist size may be more important than weight for multiple heart attack risk early pregnancy leads to a higher risk of early heart disease, according to a new study in the british medical journal. researchers examined 14,000 women after giving birth, and three-quarters reported a risk of heart disease. the 27-year-old women were randomly assigned to keep their waist size in check, and had a 0.6 percent chance of getting heart disease before giving birth. women who had a poor testroplege (negative exercise habits) or a poor testroplege (negative weight) were assigned to see how much weight they shed during pregnancy. the second dozen women gave as much as 80 pounds. the researchers found that the late delivery of a child increases the risk of a heart attack by one percent and by more than one percent, as compared to women who ate more calories in a pregnancy as early as 32 weeks, after the first trimester. so what was behind the lowered risk? if women whose weight was very high compared to women who were obese were underweight, the decreased risk of early heart disease would continue to increase. we're not talking about people's weight, we're talking about women's fitness. ""people are not very skinny and they're too fat, so if you become overweight you're going to have cardiovascular problems, lower blood flow to the heart and that can lead to a really bad result,"" said dr. ewen bennett, who worked on the study. ""so in this case you were in a little bit of a 'big fat no-breaker' diet. here we used a large population of women on a fat diet to go out to exercise and eat more often,"" bennett told cnn. ""our findings are pretty convincing. in fact, there are plausible reasons not to be overweight. it's simple -- but you have a genetic predisposition or biological predisposition to develop cardiovascular disease,"" bennett added. ""one of the places i think we know is that your body is both a fat-burning machine, and it's complex, and it's very hard to appreciate as a person,"" he added. the study suggests that the prenatal obesity raised other risk factors for the heart. first, participating in the risk-reduction diet did mean that in addition to being overweight, obese women also had major body mass index readings of .75, or about 24 pounds, and six people had an overweight body mass index of .10. bennett said those who ate more calories during pregnancy increased the risks of an early heart attack. so while obesity may make us leaner and meaner, women of certain racial and ethnic backgrounds also have greater likelihood of an early heart attack. frequency of pregnancy first, birth can make you more likely to receive an early heart attack, said bennett. the study used data from a recent multidisciplinary heart review trial, but includes longer-term reports of cardiovascular events. ""the lack of certainty that one may have the potential for heart attack and therefore a quick heart attack is very problematic. too often we see those who want to be thin and people who want to be confident saying, 'i'm not having these fits,'"" bennett added. during pregnancy, women with unhealthy weight were 25 percent more likely to get a heart attack.

422,"Exercise advice on food labels could help reduce obesity, researchers say new york (cnn) — fitness, detox and meditation can help ward off risk factors for obesity, but how much exercise really helps with weight control, aren't seen as helpful in reducing the health risk, a new study suggests. treatments, exercising and meditation may be helpful to reducing weight, especially for people living with diabetes and non-diabetic conditions, and for people who are feeling extremely weight-conscious, researchers led by researchers at the harvard t.h. chan school of public health found. but the results couldn't separate the two approaches directly. the investigators examined the role of exercise, inflammation and inflammation-related conditions in obesity, and found changes in specific measures of inflammation. specifically, the team showed that a heavier person who exercised had a smaller and weaker than average daily body mass index, meaning they consume fewer calories. in contrast, overweight and obese individuals whose exercise was targeted only to specific diseases were actually at more active risk for obesity. ""these findings bolster the ongoing evidence linking exercise and inflammation, and highlight the need for further research to study the impact of exercise on obesity,"" study researcher dr. jozef faderam of the t.h. chan school of public health and cambridge university in massachusetts said in a statement. researchers studied data from two epidemiologic databases: a data set representing the amount of exercise time a person exercised, and an excel spreadsheet with a daily rate of daily calories burned. to come up with the effect of exercise on obesity, the researchers scanned the data for serum oxygen content, ph, ph4, and ozone. they also analyzed the data for elevated skin ph, a measure of chronic acidity in the skin and the ph of the tank. they also looked at the levels of both two types of inflammation, in comparison with the 0.75- and 0.65-degree ranges in calorie, insulin, and abdominal fat values, respectively. they took tissue samples and compared the cortisol levels and insulin levels for both groups in the sample. they found the levels of inflammation and inflammation-related conditions in the cohorts were significantly higher in obese people with obesity and those with non-diabetic conditions than in those with controls. the study was published in the journal healthy people.",grover
423,"What this sunny, religious town in California teaches us about living longer a few two years ago, i had a cup of coffee with my liberal coworker to talk about life ahead and what some of our community's younger generations (one of them the kids of my parents) might be thinking about. what she and i had shared, in no small measure, was that our grandparents, who lived to be 50 and were predisposed to alzheimer's disease, had been walking long distances all along their retirement years before we were going to die. this was a wise decision. after more than 20 years of hoping for a normal life expectancy, we entered my niece's home in northern california. i was looking forward to lunch and weekends away from home, but while i was tired at work when i was sick, i found the plans for a quiet home and the mind-bendingly expansive views of the pacific ocean to be incredibly challenging to design and execute. upon my arrival, i found a guy who was in his late 30s living around 50 to 60 years old with a predisposed to alzheimer's disease. well, his five years and the time he was spent in his 90s didn't end with him being a good husband. he came back home and missed his family, the first time i had had a conversation with him and i wanted to speak more freely about his situation. we talked about whether or not he had an environment in which he knew his fate. for many of us, planning is a process of moving away from poverty or isolation, and often in much worse moments than we usually do. the choice to move out is critical in deciding if to live long enough to endure the agony of failure and hopefully slow down the process of becoming a normal person. and when we have families in place that are ready and willing to hold us, even as years or generations pass and there's time for us to be comfortable knowing that we can stop the process and live life with minimal regret. for many older adults, starting at age 50 is the place where we finally begin to pay into the nest. as seniors are nearing retirement and becoming, maybe, new, qualified providers, we're starting to listen. we can't be complacent, we can't seem to believe we have enough time to be certain that we're doing well. with the passage of one vote in the last decade, we can now boldly head out for better, healthier life choices rather than pursue every option we're afraid of. before i reached 62, i did a couple of things right; one was getting in touch with a pediatrician. she is widely regarded as the best prognosticator in the field of pediatric care and offers diverse advice and resources. the other was getting involved with a community project involving the children of parents with oncology-delinquent families. every month we prepare an end-of-life paper for our grandchildren and their caregivers. each december, we write a thank-you letter. the paper was inked into our palms, leaving us with a touch of hope, hopes and love. ""in each year since then, i have had the opportunity to say, 'thank you,'"" writes ruth whittaker, our kids' director of child development. ""i am grateful for all the additional blessings i have had in the short years since i have been old."" i know that as life moves forward, we'll have to change our negative behaviors; how we respond to strangers and see them as often associated with our ailments, talents, or abilities. there are many reasons why we're not living to our full potential, so imagine being part of these systems of well-being that we're not able to enjoy the privilege of just hanging out with friends. i know. you don't. you don't bring life, sunshine and ease to life when you look at it, saying how grateful you are that something like this came your way. you're a person with a deep connection to god, a reason to not care anymore, a reason to find the inner peace, the reason for feeling good to begin with. if anyone thinks our culture hasn't changed since our pioneers and elders were old, try ordering yourself a birth certificate. just don't think this is a ""pro-life,"" ""sisterhood,"" or a lifestyle choice. these things, more than anything else, can all be changed — with or without a few conveniences and certain basic behaviors. as we age, we must change our attitudes, our behaviours, our behaviors.",grover

427,"Social media use may harm teens' mental health by disrupting positive activities, study says new york (cnn) — of the millions of texts, tweets and facebook posts posted daily to the social media sites, social media users in teens face more social anxiety, a new study found. the researchers led by joselyn cadavilla, a psychologist at new york's amherst college in amherst, new york, looked at positive response rates for all messages about mental health. they found that these tweets and posts caused anxiety for more than a year. they also observed the elevated anxiety risk for teens. and of the critical words in these tweets, anxiety about stress likely increased, the study found. ""any kind of emotional tension or anxiety could've been impairing the functioning of social networks, but rather than allowing [riskers] to reach the level that they should reach in this post-health rush, the risks were lowered,"" said cadavilla, who led the study published in december in the journal plos one. prevalence of negative response emotional anxiety can lead to depression, anxiety disorders, epilepsy and other mental health issues, a public health crisis with high rates among black youth. during the study period, women were more likely to have negative responses to social media messages than men. cadavilla said it may be that the increased connection between the connection between social media and mental health symptoms, because comments are often re-traumatized when things get out of hand, doesn't help them. ""their words and actions need to be reviewed,"" she said. ""i don't think they [investigative experts] have looked at it before."" this leads to a ""continuous cycle of punishment"" to restrict social activity that puts people in the ""reproductive mode"" and makes them feel ""depressed,"" the authors of the study said.

428,"Vaping: What's a parent to do? the consumer product safety commission has received 4,006 tips from parents about their children's use of their own e-cigarettes and phthalates. the cpsc believes about 80% of cigarettes containing some form of pvc are going through the correct safe procedures, and no other products are being properly consumed and consumed. here's what your kids need to know about cigarettes. consider afternoons when they're lounging in the sun what is the impact on your child if you're just outside the gym on the day before an exam. your teen might be more excited when he or she enters a school restroom as they kick the book on the floor so they may be in shape to take more exams before heading out onto the street. what are the risks of smoke and plastic products? according to the cpsc, very many potential health risks associated with tobacco products in recent years have been documented by experts. the fda has identified more than 12,000 exposure-based products with potentially fatal or non-fatal effects in the past decade. in addition, research has shown that a person with cigarette addiction can suffer from behavioral behavioral change—opulsive behaviors that can manifest in many different psychological and emotional responses. what are known about phthalates? in 2016, the fda said polyethylene that is manufactured in an injection mold and is similar to that in cigarettes or suntan lotion are used for ""microbial composition and adaptability,"" that could potentially be toxic. on a recent news report, a local tv station reported a study using vx, a phthalate that is known for producing increased cholangiocyanate and other effects, on 12,000 adults in the u.s. what should kids do before vaping? if you have kids in a secluded area of the house, it is safer to vape in the privacy of their bedroom, and the ambient surroundings, and in the bathroom in case of an emergency. just because the smell of vaping can be a little high isn't really what you're seeing. however, if it seems too much, young people can sleep with big glossy bangs and folds of thread. read more if you don't have electricity or faucets, you're not going to be vaping and what happens when you open it? before vaping in the heat of a couple of hours, the child can tell his parents if he's feeling nervous and anxious, and/or fatigued. when is vaping not safe? vaping can be harmful to your child as its effects can put you at risk for respiratory distress. symptoms can include low loyalties, lack of concentration and fatigue, fatigue from inhaling thick amounts of gas or pollutants, exposure to low and moderate concentrations of fatty acids, if exposed to the e-liquid, and effects of e-liquid-by-wire. how much do these products get through the fda? vape cartridges use a certain amount of glycerin and contain potassium chloride instead of magnesium chloride. both illegal drugs have to be squeezed out of the cartridge and turned into a biodegradable and biostatistic additive. vape cartridges can also be very heavy and can turn your blood into a large natural vapour. you may want to consult a physician before you buy any more since the particles cause so much damage. what's the proper age to vape? establish your age before you buy any vaping products. just remember to look at the label or packaging of the products you're buying with your own eyes. the labels label with the product name apply to the consumer in the convenience of being able to purchase the product; you must purchase the product on its own and not reliant on third parties. if your child has physical ailments that can be treated with these substances, they are at a higher risk than those of chemicals, possibly as a result of the more toxic e-liquid.",grover
429,"Leukemia: Could germ-free childhoods could trigger illness? the immune system works perfectly against mice infected with leukemia. but a new study has found an intriguing correlation between germ-free childhoods and the risk of leukaemia, type 2 diabetes and brain cancers. the research appears in the april 11 issue of the journal cancer. leukemia and type 2 diabetes are very common in children, and children who are diagnosed with the disease every year are at increased risk of developing these diseases, according to the centers for disease control and prevention. in these cases, children with leukemia are at higher risk of developing diabetes and more likely to receive it, scientists said. the virus that causes an autoimmune reaction causes lesions in the brain and is known to also cause birth defects. scientists have already shown that mice afflicted with leukemia, other types of autoimmune conditions, have high immune cells, which invade parts of the body and can trigger inflammation. the new research showed that mice infected with double the number of immune cells in their blood do not produce white blood cells, while the mice that received the double number of cells in their blood did not produce the white blood cells. the proteins called malinophores have a role in producing antibodies that work as defenses against t cells, which is one of the more dangerous types of t cell damage. ""our findings suggest that animal models of the immune system take different, less radical route of attack from an animal model of the same inherited genetic disease,"" said lead author dennis bradbury, phd, professor of disease sciences at the university of washington. in the experiment, researchers measured the immune response in two groups. in the first group, mice with extremely high levels of immune cells had a mean genetic mutation in the b antigen, and this response meant they need more tumor cells. ""by randomizing this defect and targeting it in mice with high levels of immune cells, we saw that mice with both very high levels of immune cells were not at the same extreme risk of developing leukemia and other types of autoimmune diseases,"" said bradbury. this prompted researchers to investigate whether the most common lifestyle, including high blood pressure, alcohol consumption and smoking, would predispose individuals to a specific type of immune system, the authors said. ""it could be either immune-mediated by high levels of cells versus limited immunity by high levels of immune cells,"" said professor roger bischoff, phd, professor of infectious diseases and professor of biology at the university of minnesota. bradbury, whose lab is currently developing a vaccine for leukemia, said the finding shows that research currently being done at uw is focused on finding other strategies to improve individuals' immune systems, especially the b antigen. ""the effect of these combination therapy studies are quite intriguing,"" he said. furthermore, the new study found that mice with the most low levels of immune cells in their blood do not become leukaemia. ""an under-trend is the increases in immunity in the cells where the relative absorption level of immune cells is lower than are seen with normal immune cells,"" bradbury said. ""since we would want to see that this signaling pathway of the immune system flares,"" he said, ""the ability to maintain a sufficiently high level of immunity is important.""",grover

434,"Sit, stand, sit: The new science about how to best use your standing desk before i begin — and you know the answer — i need to share that right before i talk to you: 1. everyone has clearly said that ""all workers should have the same opportunity to have a standing desk."" but given that that so many of us were taught to be physical when we worked for work long ago, and may well not still be in it, sit is the best decision to make. without fully realizing the science at hand, the truth is that in 15 months of training at the national standards institute it is no wonder that 43 percent of the american workforce is currently sitting — three times as many as the next most common way to sit is on the desk at work. in fact, if the college educated are to continue to support working together, we must do it every day. 2. as humans, standing desks are precious treasures in our lives. granted, this is a body of work that might be the american work culture's most successful field, but it is also true of standing desks: however difficult it may be to get to them, they are replete with physics and heroines who rejoice the triumph of what you can say with your feet. you need to know when you need to use them, in order to feel good about your own feet. if you are lonely, or alone at work, thinking about who to partner with if you need a better bench when suddenly finding you isn't easy, sit now and get used to it. 3. standing desks are famously popularized by joanna herring in the 1970s and the post-modern surrealist joseph pulitzer and anna kournikova in the 1990s. and certainly no tech-based heroines are aping them to stand — in fact, there are a host of confused and tepid ones out there who have begun to wonder whether, for the first time in our lives, we can be the complete best form of physical exercise. we must fall back to doing what we love and letting go of any inhibitions of staying upright. if standing desk isn't what you've been working out for, just pick the start line and give yourself a good, pre-work routine: related: an adventure in muscle memory 4. standing desks are definitely not a male priority. the fast start-up of l'oreal has a reputation as the unsung hero of muscle memory — everywhere you look and smell your way around, your legs sound far ahead, your arms like they are moving their way out of you. yet even as in, you feel a little sluggish — and i'm not joking — standing with a super stiff leg doesn't just help you beat the clock — it makes you feel good about yourself.",grover
435,"Not all screen time causes kids to underperform in school, study says rebecca black is right. it may be time for kids to start looking at screens a bit differently. according to a new study that published monday in pediatrics, kids who sit a low or four points behind their peers at school are much more likely to become delinquent in their assigned class. those with less screen time are more likely to become delinquent within four years of graduation, according to the study's findings. for the rest of that time, kids aren't much better. there's a basic reason why: kids, particularly those who do not have a lot of screen time, spend as much time sitting in front of television and computers as they do playing computer games. ""an overly active child is a little less likely to get into school if he's exposed to other activities,"" said study co-author madeline ellens, an associate professor at university of california at davis school of public health. children with less screen time tend to get less emotional rest and social mobility, and also get worse in the long run, the study authors write. meanwhile, those kids are clearly more prone to setbacks. ""but this finding shows that that can certainly have a significant effect on behavior toward responsibility and response,"" ellens told cnn. her study focuses on primary school children, and is not the first to say that shorter-than-normal screen time results in lower social mobility, which seems to be especially important in low-income communities. but it points out that the study's conclusions don't mean our cultural biases behind screen time will stop. rather, it's likely to become the primary means of checking the kids in class. schools, schools and kids will need to be more scrutinized. the kids will need to feel they are contributing more, ellens said. ""even though they need to be likelier to be in school and be proactive in supporting an array of behaviors we see on a daily basis — playing for an hour for a friday afternoon, or watching tv in a 15-minute period for a period of time — eventually we'll begin to see broader declines than even this small but significant number of students,"" the report said. that means kids coming from less advantaged households will experience a relatively larger drop-off in social mobility, and that may have a big effect on ""an adolescent's ability to participate in and experience studies and parenting,"" the report authors wrote.",grover

437,"Mixing less than 6 hours of sleep with chronic disease is deadly combo (cnn) — in a study that included more than 34,000 people who took more than 6 hours of sleep a night, researchers found that people who slept fewer than the recommended 7 hours a night also had a higher risk of developing chronic disease. ""we believe that when people become severely ill that their body's biological clock changes between 7:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m., it plays an important role in chronic disease,"" said the study's senior author, anthony luh, m.d., lead author of the study and a board-certified general-market dentist who lives in the district of columbia. luh said a variety of factors may contribute to the health problems of the participants. for example, people have higher blood sugar levels in adulthood. pain and stress may also play a role in maintaining a healthy immune system. blood sugar in adults is common in adulthood, and immune systems can be more prone to ""stress weapons"" — such as food or medicine — that trigger chronic disease, luh said. in the latest research published in the journal of the american medical association, luh and his colleagues found that insomnia was the most common cause of death in such patients. other researchers have shown that chronic symptoms and chronic disease are related. the study focused on a group of 200 people. those who complained of low body temperatures and low-quality sleep quality were shown to be higher risk of having multiple different chronic conditions that produced similar benefits. researchers divided 2,485 people into two groups, those who had experienced no chronic disease or chronic sleep fatigue, and those who experienced no chronic disease and chronically ill. the researchers found that patients who were affected by chronic disease had 30% higher levels of insomnia than patients who had slept about 7 hours a night. those whose insomnia led to accidents or suicides were even more likely to have a risk of developing chronic disease compared to those who didn't suffer from insomnia. the risk of dying in the study is higher if people used a long, longer sleep schedule over the course of the study than if they were alone, said the study's co-author, senior author zorgy m. geragos, m.d., a major research economist with the cdc and a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the national institutes of health in bethesda, maryland. they did note that the lower sleep duration did not lead to higher cardiovascular risk. ""but we think that isn't enough to persuade anyone not to sleep the night before a doctor prescribes sleep apnea,"" geragos said. the study cautioned against extrapolating where insomnia was on the table — it was too early to tell if patients at higher risk had shorter sleep schedules and were likely to be harmed by insomnia. but the study's conclusion that people who slept about 7 hours a night had a higher risk of developing chronic disease was broader than the findings earlier based on other studies, geragos said. ""if you don't sleep during the week — like 12 hours a night — you're probably going to end up having a higher chance of developing some type of chronic disease,"" he said. the researchers identified 14 common symptoms in patients who had chronic sleep issues: insomnia, chronic headaches, headaches and frequent flushing. the one risk they found for chronic sleep issues were chronically ill individuals who had not slept at night. but it was the effects of the conditions that were most common among the older participants — stroke, stroke — that was not widely known. ""the biggest limitation of this study is that the participant respondents were all healthy,"" geragos said. he said the researchers recommend people having nightly sleep for most of their lives, and he had no worries about keeping them all awake. ""if you're really in the throes of a high risk event, the things that protect you are the drugs and other treatments — recovery from physical or psychological trauma, or power loss — and then the antipsychotics and such,"" he said.

""as the story goes, 'oh, well, why didn't she find another tree?'"" said gary titlock of new jersey. ""he managed to get the tree down to the top, and made sure it was propped up."" what happened next is anyone's guess. the north coast couple called police but the cops came back calling them and determined to locate the tree, according to a story in the salt lake tribune. the man, who was 19-1/2 months, was recovering from surgery when they finally discovered the tree. ""it looked kind of glamorous, but it wasn't,"" titlock said. ""it was like a white-knuckle set-up."" the couple that called to find the tree were afraid that needles wouldn't fall off and said it might break in a few seconds. instead they did what many families do in less than a decade: work with local animal control. dietitian brian brian mason, director of the food safety section of the national center for disease control, said the family was very careful. they didn't skimp on their ""rattlers."" ""if they're storing something that can fall off someone's clothing, they're not going to put their toothpick and skew it,"" mason said.

""and that's just what this story is about."" it's a story that has further touched the lives of doctors and society. but stoner's story isn't unique. in the united states, thousands of people each year get the procedure. some opt for iv lines. some don't. a recent study found that those experiencing infertility don't even have to worry about needles causing their true reproductive dysfunction. yet, experts caution that people who get the procedure have a higher chance of developing complications such as postpartum depression, fertility problems, anxiety or/or low body weight, as well as behavioral and emotional complications. ""overall, what's most important to understand is that, in an era when the internet is going to be the latest social media, myths have advanced,"" titlock said.

And then anti-vaxers attacked her how brutal that is. my son, adam, died yesterday, dec. 17, 2015, from complications from a rare genetic cancer of the umbilical cord. his body was wrapped in a layer of food and sheet, and the bedspread was encased in a plastic wrap that no one would reach. on a daily basis, his father has told us, he has never seen his son with flesh and blood. his death left me dizzy and berserk. he started clenching and rambling — a symptom, not necessarily inherited, as his parents want us to believe. and there is no way he could have survived without it. at least no one else to care for. when his father died, he would say, ""forgive me for not knowing better."" he would tell us, ""i will spend years and years now helping make a memorial to my daddy."" but then, those words became fake, because adam was never given the proper context, or proper family support, because adam was dying, and he never had such a ring of support. he would tell us, ""i want to make my daddy proud of who i am."" instead, adam would tell us, ""i'm happy to be my daddy's girlfriend."" neither of adam's two sisters — who aren't named (in this case adam) nor their children — were acquainted with his father, and so adam ended up in his father's arms. not even adam's parents could stand up for adam, without mentioning his right to take his life. now, half a century later, i'm still figuring out if my son had known better. does he have a sense of who we are, or how he might have reached a place as grand as here in this story? my journey of revelation opens a path, one not without its woes. perhaps adam's death shed new light on his love for the jews and perhaps that link altered who he really was, to believe that someone of adam's father's stature may have been searching for the spirit of the man he loved the most and that he had lost all that he had loved. however, for all those who think that all this unhappiness and divisiveness are preparation for surrender to the corporate noise about the possible sale of british beef to israel or the dissolution of the so-called nuclear non-proliferation treaty, at least i have tried to understand adam's chosen issue by explaining how he and his father work together. i could set up clear rules that only the idea of their fate should be established, and then divide their battle among them on various levels. why would anyone support such a deal? at the core of it are the two jewish leaders whose ideals include justice for the jewish victims of genocide and a safer future for humanity. how could those two be in conflict? consider the following solution: the reason we chose to remain apart is to realize that we just can't live without each other. it does not matter that no one other than adam's parents have met the nazis or that his parents have met those born from the norwegian birthplaces. neither of them seems to have had any time for planning. neither of them seemed at peace. if there was ever a time to meet, to form an understanding of one another, adam certainly was one of them. we knew he was a uniquely jewish boy who wanted to break out of his parent's arms and turn into the spirit of him, while remaining, in his, jew's, father's arms, the most fabulous in judaism. one might ask why adam chose to break away, even because he thought he wanted to become an heir to a different family's sins? in his plea for god, adam touched on such dark subjects as that of the holocaust, and reveals as much when he describes his love for the ancestors of the poor and that of the sick, i think the way jesus was blessed, for that was ultimately for all of us. as he described those who tortured adam, his father's tragedy and his mother's death, he refused to accept his destiny alone. that's a fate other jews just have to fall in love with. t",grover

There's nothing to be ashamed of' sanford, fla. - men growing intersex body parts are no longer acceptable as parents-child advocates grapple with their children's likely reaction to the practice, and raising the topic brought to light by a florida patient. as a result, several florida families have petitioned their state legislature to require such practices to be prohibited in at least four different states: in multiple states; in three states; and in many other states. ""for parents who are already concerned about their children's reaction to those parts being inserted into them, screening and medical procedures done for gender reassignment [is important],"" said dr. cyril coleman, director of the center for gender, sexuality and relationships at children's hospital at philadelphia, pennsylvania. coleman was among the first to respond to the florida petition and asked his pediatrician to conduct a urine test to see if there was any evidence of the gender expression on children in his clinic. but his daughter, and she happens to be seven months old, doesn't seem surprised by the fact that her parents would like her to look at adult gender expression. ""i had kids growing up straight... i said 'you know what? a double gender multiple sexes up,'"" coleman said. when asked whether he believes gender expression on children is affected in his clinic, coleman said ""absolutely."" but his recent campaign has created an international outcry, according to cnn affiliate wjxt in florida. ""i have my daughter born intersex,"" a supporter wrote. ""she was born straight. why is that? what is wrong with her? she is not born with no clear disability."" and, ""this is your body. ... there's nothing to be ashamed of."" families that have filed the local effort had a higher level of passion and commitment as they approached what seems to be a pivotal turning point for their discussions with parents. for one particular doctor who knew about the view of intersex children and the impact it has on their symptoms, the involvement of a treatment provider sparked a passionate response from parents. the efficacy of the therapy, and its prevention, were among the arguments parents lodged with their legislature. dr. john o'brien, a vascular surgeon, said he had a child with one of the two female personalities, which is primarily males. ""i felt like, to this point, this is a critical moment in my career, so i went to see my doctor and we discussed ways to start,"" he said. a health professional who worked at an endocrinology clinic noticed a difference in patients' perception about the implications of intersex-related genitals and even a non-psychological gender expression. ""and if you are attracted to a non-diverse variety, it could be a barrier to treatment because you would want to know that you were attracted to someone else,"" o'brien said. ""and then if they have their problem with that, it might also be a barrier for treatment because they may not have resources or services to address it because of the gender expression."" o'brien recommends that parents consider whether their child can name their gender — whether a partner could even be identified in the patient's name — or share information with their doctor. the idea of accessing medical imaging to identify genitals is long ago considered obsolete. today, dentists routinely perform cardiopulmonary, breathing and soft tissue examinations to measure the size and shape of the penis. one of the most popular techniques is to have genital diversions measured, which appears to be the subject of worry. the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention recommends for parents, reproductive physicians and emergency room employees the creation of a free consultation program designed to test the possibility of a female gender in their children. testing the results of the identification will involve the results of an external clinical panel funded by the centers for disease control and prevention, which will examine the information and techniques used. panelist dr. david kehler, a behavioral biology expert at sanford health, says that screening and gender evaluation for intersex children have always been very effective methods. ""many of the docs that i talked to at ob say it is a big issue and we feel like it has to be done right away,"" kehler said.",grover
443,"Surprising factors that may keep you thin if you look at your body composition in the five things you study most — nutrition, diet, exercise, and exercise. but for those of us who don't diet, exercising and managing our body weight (and sleep), sleep deprivation (or, for any of the other ones that we look at, picking up and resting) can be factors for what goes on inside our bodies. and each of those factors might be another reason why you're vulnerable to near-term cardiovascular problems. traditionally, we study our body biology, and the work done on our bodies in order to measure the metabolic rate — which we then observe to evaluate trends in our muscle mass and/or heart health. but, finally, we get the idea that — when looking at our genetics, we don't always see very good or bad things about ourselves, or anyone. so, our fate in the world can rest entirely on our genes. research has also shown that there are some special genes that inhibit life and the development of the body, and that people's metabolism in the body may be impacted more by their metabolism than other genes. but, other genes may have significantly different costs for the body (at least in terms of health). that's why, one of the most important factors that can cause a change in how a person metabolizes your body's food (intraubercept, il_16), another important factor in how metabolism works, is exposure to hiv. this infection is especially dangerous as hiv/aids itself is still very uncommon. you may take a cocktail of anti-hiv drugs either hiv or their type (dehydroosis and overheating), and continue to consume small amounts of these medications. so, one of the important factors we are under here in the world, a known genetic difference between us, is that of connection between genes. depending on the time it takes us to set the circadian rhythms of the body in order to differentiate ourselves from other humans, mutations can sometimes explain this weakness. so, perhaps when we're talking about blood clotting, oral therapy or some other potential solutions, we should think about the connection between blood clotting, blood volume and flight that we're getting from our bodies. let's start with our limits, pronto. at first glance, this may sound like gibberish. but there are really just a few other common patterns that seem to creep us to our limits at most. for example, two tests of hemoglobin affect the heart, and one of the first to do this is bpr (the standard blood measuring tool). so, it's very possible that we can literally recognize ourselves as hot and humid in order to compensate for this. so, one of the main considerations to consider when thinking about maintenance of blood sugar levels is that bpr is caused by a release of sodium from cells. perhaps this isn't completely accurate, so we'll have to monitor our health closely. depending on the time it takes us to set the circadian rhythms of the body in order to differentiate ourselves from other humans, mutations can sometimes explain this weakness. so, perhaps when we're talking about blood clotting, oral therapy or some other potential solutions, we should think about the connection between blood clotting, blood volume and flight that we're getting from our bodies. we'll have to monitor our health closely. being exposed to adverse events like heart attacks, strokes, or skin tumors may also make some people more likely to switch to other therapies, such as surgery or restorative treatments, to avoid a recurring blood clot. those screenings are a small fraction of what we're facing, and you don't want to be spending much time worrying about your supply of medications or weight fluctuations. ultimately, health and sleep — which often results in long stretches of sleep or at least some good sleep — can shape the body's ability to function in a deep way. yours truly has to look at that as well.",grover

""last year, there were a record number of people infected with flu during the mildest season in history — but the virus has declined over the past few months,"" cdc director tom frieden said in a statement wednesday. ""we are now seeing lower viral load and fewer cases per year, and it is also showing signs of weakening."" according to cdc figures, two or three people will die of flu-related cause by this time next year, while the other half will become sick with illnesses likely linked to flu. an estimated 450,000 people who were sick with flu in 2016 in the u.s. have died. the centers for disease control and prevention estimates the number of sick people includes as many as 500,000 infected by 2017. there is a nasty bird flu virus called h5n1 avian influenza. this strain of avian influenza has an 85% chance of causing complete disfigurement or die. who's to say that the people we've seen in the press this season won't be able to re-enter the rapidly evolving environment that they've termed ""normal."" so far, there have been a few serious complications related to the flu virus in the united states, including a scare in which a lab worker died of flu-like symptoms due to the flu. but unlike all the other illnesses they've spread through the air, h5n1 flu hasn't so far developed on surfaces even of the gravelly sneezing form it strains. it's possible that the slow development of h5n1 caused a break in the virus' global relationship to birds as it is now. in other words, the trend for the flu has appeared to shrink as a result of viral pools in both the u.s. and canada. but in the way people usually die, a few are awfully late to die — yet another case of the flu. and when influenza can get worse, the chances of becoming infected is significant. vaccination rates of childhood up to 18 months are typically passed through by adults — the cdc has attributed the rise in viral stress that causes death to a new vaccine that has not yet been approved. so, while flu-infected people often do not have a credible experience with flu, parents can still get the virus from other sources, including friends, family and businesses. for many americans, the coronavirus pandemic means a normal life is on hold. but what if they die from a flu-like illness after too little protection? according to a published study by the national center for health statistics, there are over 21,000 deaths linked to influenza in the u.s. over the past decade. at that rate, the flu could wind up killing more than 350,000 people by 2050. considering the number of people estimated to die of flu in the u.s. as a result of the h5n1 epidemic, don't count on folks dying. take it as a sign you may not be able to get the flu vaccine until someone has died of complications, such as pneumonia, left acute respiratory failure or kidney failure. what if something can be prevented? poptromlike pain in the head is one of the worst common symptoms for people with flu. it can also be severe, like an eyes or mouth ulcer. if you or your loved one are feeling particularly ill, try to think about what should happen next, but you know that causing a flu-like illness could be deadly. • if you haven't had a good antiviral treatment recently, you may be a little too late, says a new study published in the journal fluinfo. • if you like how long you're sitting idle and feel sore or sick, feel plenty of pain — perhaps at work.",grover
456,"'Prolonged, unprotected contact' led to first person-to-person coronavirus transmission in the US, study says san francisco (cnn) - investigators have discovered a person-to-person travel/travel-to-home (gtp) transmission of human coronavirus in the united states, according to a new study. the coronavirus in human test cases suggests that prolonged time spent in or near people during or during an gtp transmission may result in a longer and more virulent life-threatening infection of the gastrointestinal tract, researchers said. cape-cending case of a human case of coronavirus showed that individual patients infected with the virus between 1976 and 1994, who died during or after the initial infection, were nearly ten times more likely to transmit the virus to a second person, the study was reported in the journal of the american medical association. the virus can easily be passed from person to person in coughing, sneezing or mouth rashes, the study noted. ""this is the first case to describe a significant and distinct link between two types of transmission,"" said lead author dr. ruth hansen of the mayo clinic in rochester, minnesota. in addition to a brief history of human infection that ended in septic shock or death of a person who has died, chronic infectious disease transmission generally occurs over time, she said. because a virus is acquired by a person, viruses from flu can infect people, which means that people who have never had a disease experience a period of prolonged, unprotected contact with their body, the study said. the second case of coronavirus between 1994 and 1994 found in the us ""may be an extension of typical ""travel"" travel to the country and a ""clinical hazard to people,"" hansen and colleagues note. the similarities between coronavirus and non-travel travelers account for their cross-symptoms, the findings said. ""another key point is that inter-human people rarely come into contact with their own body cells, which could lead to an increased risk of infectious diseases when all interaction is deemed to be preventable,"" hansen and colleagues said. when the flu pandemic struck the u.s. in 2009, fewer than 20% of population was infected with the virus. as of march, almost 15 million people had visited hospitals or emergency rooms during the flu pandemic, the new study said. that number is projected to rise as new cases become common. the new study isn't the first to show that people who have traveled to the u.s. are at higher risk for viruses to infect their bodies. but the new findings were the first to compare those travelers to people who had experienced symptoms similar to those people had died before sharing their hospital room with the infected other travelers. in that case, who are still in hospital and who have been sick for the duration of the outbreak, another known risk factors for infection in the united states is no longer there. so, the new results reinforce all of the points that it appeared that people are less susceptible to a flu pandemic because they do travel more frequently, the study found. but no one yet knows for sure whether travel days traveled to the u.s. were as important as people traveled to other countries, the new study said. ""it is much too early to tell,"" said jody adam, a professor of human infectious diseases and infectious diseases medicine at johns hopkins university in baltimore. the three countries that received the strongest cases of pre-existing viruses of which there were currently still only 20 cases spread to the u.s. by the 2008 and 2009 outbreak: mexico, australia, italy and new zealand. there were also one new human case from italy (planting the virus in the intestines of a patient in the hospital), two from greece (coughing and vomiting of an infected person) and one from vietnam (blood poisoning of an infected person in the hospital). it is the first known case of a h5n1 coronavirus infection of a human, the new study found.

(cnn) — flu season is heating up in the united states, and not just the riskiest season yet. the centers for disease control says that by the end of december, there was some evidence the flu might have reached epidemic proportions — and any weather event tied to the season could pose a risk to anyone trying to get sick. there's not a lot of time to panic, the cdc says — you can easily raise your alarm through coughing or sneezing, but quickly ventilate yourself, according to the guidelines. who's at risk? the information on the flu cases you've seen in recent months might give you some idea about who might be at risk, but researchers have still found people under 40 often have a relatively large risk of becoming flu-like symptoms. most of those who get sick after starting a flu-like illness are either ""weeping, lethargic or incoherent — with tired or breathless voices and very faint and unable to breathe,"" says sheila siegfried, m.d., m.p.h., the flu medicine researcher at west virginia university in morgantown. to catch the flu, the cdc recommends waiting until symptoms appear to affect the other symptoms, and stopping any breathing they do not normally go through. if symptoms aren't over one day, the cdc recommends waiting two or three days before any symptoms appear.",grover
458,"Broadway theaters to suspend all performances because of coronavirus have you noticed one z or two people whose noses pop out in the toilets? well, now those sirens are coming to broadway. at least, that's what one broadway theater decided to put in place wednesday. subdividli, a british baudette from the age of 80 that was touring the plays at the national theatre in london, decided to suspend its performances at their regular venues for the rest of the week amid the coronavirus outbreak in south korea and also for its unseasonably warm weather. the tragic situation prompted the cancellations. the troupe at city of hope, a new york city-based dance club, decided to risk it for an epiphany when it realized that it is being hit with a spike in gastrointestinal problems. the incident, which started around 1:30 a.m. friday, occurred as the troupe's owners were celebrating the company's posthumous tony-award winning production of p.c. annette bening, who won the tony in ""my fair lady,"" was one of the first to notice the situation.

""she stood there, pointed to the floor, and she realized that it was the first time that's happened in two months."" as the incident unfolded, another security guard arrived on stage and discreetly asked, ""did they notify you?"" ""who replied, i didn't know, but that's ok because it's not unusual,"" bening told stonestreet. ""that's life after the olympics."" ""it was the first time i've ever been on stage in the same theater,"" she added. ""i knew there was going to be a tragedy, but to see these people's faces and their mouths, that's what i remember."" the scene unfolded.

""i was told at a certain point, 'the show is going to close because of this.'"" she decided not to do the show anymore, but rather said ""i'm going to go to the theater that i love, then to the larger theater, where i'm more focused on art and music and relationships,"" she said.",grover

460,"Babies smell 'sweet,' teens stink and blindfolded moms can tell the difference, study says researchers are trying to disprove as clear as possible that the smell of infants in the dark is a hazard to their health and behavior. a newborn's heartbeat, up close and in the face, and their cognitive behavioral qualities are measured using computer algorithms ""can give us certain cues to detect if those cues are associated with a nursing injury,"" lead researcher tanya lang, from the university of ulster in northern ireland, told reporters. using automated programing, lang and colleagues have discovered the two-parent, non-transparent infants behaved similarly to what their parents would normally do in a quality-of-life environment. the healthy infants did so in a wild-like manner. the hooked infants did so in a different, more lit, condition. because kids appear to be more sensitive to the sounds of a scent, the researchers used the same algorithm that was used in the experiment to measure how well their mothers were sleeping. signs as lang and her colleagues pointed out in the team's abstract published on tuesday in the journal pediatrics, babies in the dark may seem to smell stronger than infants in a very open environment. lang and her colleagues examined five different groups of newborns over the past year to simulate the full system, using computing and text inputs. one of the first findings was that the soft-haired babies in the dark were more sensitive to noise and odors. all of the babies spent at least three days in a darkened nursery. the second significant finding was that the bright mothers were more attentive to environments with sound, such as the bright, noisy nursery. the third finding was that the girls' performances had more color, taste, and brightness when provided by each other. the young mothers were 10 percent more likely to crave savory sweets than the parents. the findings could be incorporated into babies' babies' and babies' babies' bodies. all five babies who participated in the study had respiratory difficulties. all had multi-drug resistant infections. ""these findings make it obvious that when babies and children are in the lab, we have to ask the complex questions that a lot of parents don't ask. we must ask the complex questions in order to know whether someone is bothering an infant or not,"" said linette mcguire, co-director of infectious diseases and economics at the school of veterinary medicine at uup. to test for color lang took different photographs of the infants in the dark and diagnosed them with an infection on the babies' back, neck and head. the blood test was generated using a catheter used for diagnostic purposes. using the catheter to control the infection led to detection of a type of thrombocytopenia, a serious lung disorder linked to susceptibility to infections such as thrombocytopenia. lang and her colleagues tested 10 infants with thrombocytopenia—a common form of infections—on the eelbarase automated selection system. the older infants had matted hair and dry skin. researchers determined which infants were most sensitive to temperature and humidity. the older babies and infants both had brown hair and slimmer noses. the researchers then analyzed their brain activity, consumption of a variety of sensors and medications, and their developmental trajectories. those in the dark rated highly on a variety of complex programming measures, but preferred different comfort settings—the plush, comfortable environment, the loud toys. it is possible the researchers found the infants at home who did not see faces the way adults did. ""it could have been that some of the children hadn't smelled. the babies didn't smell,"" mcguire said. the researchers theorize that when children are exposed to different stimuli they notice them out of the blue. ""it could be they were napping, or it could be they were playing outside,"" mcguire said.",grover

463,"Children's coronavirus cases are not as severe, but that doesn't make them less serious after two decades and thousands of cases, the alarming numbers of children's coronavirus (search for t.v.e.) cases are nothing short of astonishing. not surprisingly, the seriousness of the numbers continues to mount. in april, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) reported that 2,331 new cases of t.v.e. in the u.s. (2,808 children were referred for evaluation), up 34% from april 2016. so even if only one child is admitted (like 3 cases were reported last month for two large children), at least seven cases represent a large population. how? simply put, it is a shocking growing rate. what is surprising is that the number of new cases is significant even though there were no statistical differences in the number of cases over the last two decades. the cdc estimates that 2,334 children were tested for the virus during the first 10 years of development, meaning that, for every additional case of t.v.e. detected, there will be at least two more children diagnosed with the virus. this even after the cdc repeatedly and unambiguously stating that you can be sure the t.v.e. will become more prevalent. who were the carriers? to understand the perils of this new outbreak, consider two important facts. first, the children who were tested for the zika virus had not yet been diagnosed with the virus. third, because the cdc had warned that cases could increase following the release of the zika virus in the u.s., the number of children whose potential destinations were changed by the mother's transmission to her child increased following the release of the zika virus in the u.s. in any case, it is alarming to see the extent of the potentially significant increase in victims' cases. what exactly is the likely cause of the large increase in children's cases in the past decade? a few things have been pointing the way: the growth of the number of t.v.e. cases has been slowing, although the cdc has said that the increase in cases was ""addressed to the increase in travel patterns"" and ""'the potential shift in perceived health risks has not yet been addressed.' this has led to an increase in the proportion of children who are tested for the virus who have received vaccines. in addition, the cdc estimates that only one child per 10,000 children was tested as a result of the zika virus last year. the cdc hasn't yet drawn any conclusions about why the rise of the zika virus over the last decade was such a massive increase. in fact, it is something else entirely. dr. kathleen sikkema, cdc's chief scientist and director of the centers for disease control and prevention's zika virus branch, hinted at the likelihood of a combination of factors in the outbreak, but added, ""we do not believe that the increase in the number of people infected due to the zika virus is a sign of an epidemic or a pandemic."" it may be true that the virus has grown exponentially from being passed around the world. but anyone who thinks the zika epidemic will extend to the u.s. is overstating it entirely. less than 10 percent of americans carry the virus, and babies born to mothers infected with the virus are three times more likely to develop an infection later in life. if we don't want to worry about the number of women who unknowingly carry the virus, we have to start carefully studying the risks at other parts of the globe. we also have to focus on women who have never had sex or who don't know how to manage children with zika. if there were any damage caused by zika, the cdc would not be alarmed. but the cdc is carefully evaluating the risk at another part of the globe that brings the virus to those states, including countries with similar restrictions. so there is no reason to view all the cases as one person spreading the virus. it has already been more than a decade since t.v.e. was initially detected, and the cdc estimates that ""all screenings were positive for zika during the first decade of the outbreak, and only one mother had contracted the disease during the first six months of the epidemic."" the cdc does not believe that the increased vaccination rates are necessarily a result of pertussis. the more important takeaway is that zika does have a strong link to any form of childhood diseases. this could even be its downfall.",grover
464,"Lessons from Ebola: The secret of successful epidemic response we all dread the dark days of ebola yet mortality rates are high. this year, ebola has carried at least 141 dead and feared lives worth more than $3 billion. we aren't even clear whether or not it was simply the fear of an overwhelming body count—vicious in its own right, as could be true of any outbreak. either the risk of dying and presumed death are receding or inaction by the public health system is becoming commonplace as well. some simple steps—using public knowledge more than seen in the ""official"" cdc newsletter—were one step toward preventing ebola. sadly, as the cdc studies in bigger and more nuanced language take our medical database to heart, we are missing the apparent path to preventable deaths and, more important, avoidable lives. the interconnectedness of all health systems is leading to short-term tragedy, which can lead to longer-term consequences. in the 2017 outbreak's second outbreak, estimated at more than 157,000 cases of ebola, that caught the private sector off guard, the response was followed by a multi-year mismanagement which resulted in an outbreak/decline of virus. to date, only 15 cases have been confirmed and an additional 1,610 deaths have been classified as probable. even though most of those involved the health sector, which is implicated by large numbers of international partners and pressure on our borders, are strangers to many countries, the country response was never in a position to respond well enough. this is why we need to raise our awareness about outbreaks and the need to prepare. two and a half decades in the ""advanced care and control system"" infrastructure has led to no real response by health entities or providers. it is past time to change the culture and begin the paradigm shift. like many major crises, ebola is transmitting its treatment and containment protocol from farm to factory, without our knowledge or regard for who has contracted and did so. we know and often rely on messages that inform patients that crisis is imminent but don't always manage to ensure their needs are met. these messages are finally receiving their intended safety vectors: cholera, diarrhea, fever, shock, and abnormal tests. although the centers for disease control and prevention is focused on prevention efforts, they are not within our grasp. we need to raise our awareness, engage with the health sector on steps we can take to ensure that the truth of the outbreak is known and recognized and streamlined for health care and well-being, and also we need to make the most effective options available to people, organizations, and government. we need to talk about how we best prepare the public for such disasters, such as ebola and like the drought storrs. in 2009, a drought storrs team estimated that it cost about $2.5 million to respond to the resulting outbreak. in the aftermath of 2008, when the drought storrs team was completely overwhelmed by the amount of response, cdc mobilized emergency medical responses to the entire country. a 2015 report from the center for disease control and prevention calls these efforts ""one of the most effective ways in which we've mobilized our healthcare system to respond to an epidemic."" we need to build in strong communications, risk avoidance mechanisms, and resources that help coordinate and coordinate, as well as activate networks that assist across healthcare systems, government, and institutions. we need to translate our way of communicating with the medical community so that it is true to what is clear in a state of urgency, and something more tangible, so that the public knows. to step back and readjust the lessons learned in recovery is of immense importance. while post-eclampsia patients in the outbreak don't die yet, they will shortly, and we will see when so many others will, the inevitable labor for discussion about our nation's health status, its politics, our differences, and our ability to respond effectively. as ebola continues to grow, it will be difficult to avoid any contagion. we need to support and help coordinate what it takes to provide the best resources and help to develop strategies to combat this great epidemic. dr. mehmet oz, an infectious disease epidemiologist with uc riverside, conducted initial reports on the outbreak in a talk and reaction to the press conference at the white house. the post lessons from ebola: the secret of successful epidemic response appeared first on socal times.",grover
465,"'They didn't protect us' say some first responders for coronavirus a recent effort by the fire department of kansas city, missouri is increasing the reach of the deadly coronavirus, something many of us may not have known or fully understood before. just this week, a black cloud of debris began to pile up from the rubble of a barn that had been razed to the ground by a wildfire in kc and other cities. just days earlier, first responders from burlington, vermont, began their work of finding an incubator that can cure the same deadly and viral virus that claimed the lives of 108 people in london. the devastation in that city comes at a time when the military and police departments have been slashing funding for the general public to help fight the deadly coronavirus and other viruses, including zika, heartworm and the zika virus. the wildfires that started in new york city this week also contributed to the fire's impact, in an effort by authorities to curb zika and other infectious diseases. this dustup has repeatedly highlighted the damage being done by coronavirus during a crisis, and through misinformation and faulty marketing, particularly when it comes to hurricanes. last week, kansas city police department tweeted that a second fire within miles of the turbine barn was caused by an ""activity hazard"" that ignited in the shed's sheds. ""based on the existing safety measures, a second fire in several hundred yards from the turbine barn prompted a second fire within three hundred yards that ultimately caused smoke damage to the sheds and roof,"" the department said. as part of its response to the fire, fire companies from princeton, missouri and lawrence, kansas, which fought fires under the umbrella of the north country fire protection district, announced a new six-month campaign targeting ""aggressive practices"" -- including additional firefighters and police on the job. ""although each program has a different approach to tackle root causes of infection, our approach, as we have been doing during these fires, is focused on taking immediate action at these area communities and saving lives,"" company spokeswoman jessica kure told cnn. but even after those safety measures were in place, fire departments have had a difficult time containing the cases in their own communities. the infectious disease infects thousands of mosquitoes that are used as an infected mosquito and its spores thrive in stagnant water. when infected mosquitoes are flushed from the water, these water-borne viruses bond to their host. officials aren't letting the tide pass them by because of this aspect of the coronavirus, but instead, they are trying to figure out ways to isolate those living in the reconditioned barns so they can be integrated into those who might be affected by the virus, kure said. when the first wave of deaths occurred in the two counties of johnson and lee, employees wrote that there were 14 patients out of nearly 1,300 people born alive, several who were exposed to or had been exposed to coronavirus. more than 5,000 people were infected with the virus. the type of vaccines for the virus in the vaccines that are given out are still under review by the fda, kure said. the culture team at the kansas city fire district has been working with several laboratories in the city of kansas city, kansas, and affected local hospitals, she said. however, having sent out a cease-and-desist letter requesting that ""the public be notified by their doctor that they may not access any locally sourced vaccine, should they start receiving the very new vaccines."" ""you're in the middle of a whole season of #kownunsactiveness and the cdc is still waiting to hear back on your request,"" she said.

466,"How to keep your workplace clean -- and yourself healthy -- during the novel coronavirus outbreak (cnn) -- four months after the swine flu pandemic began, many medical professionals say it's not too late to be alert for the next great outbreak. after state health officials continue to warn about swine flu-like illnesses, policy makers in pennsylvania, iowa, north carolina, kansas, tennessee and south carolina have floated the idea of stepping up their efforts to protect workers, their families and their employers from becoming victims of the outbreaks. how do you keep yourself and your coworkers away from a swine flu outbreak? here are three steps to help avoid the virus: 1. start following the playbook it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that the latest outbreak was random, that the virus's not going to hit everybody every time. however, experts say that's not the case. humans, like non-human primates, don't transmit directly from person to person -- so it's best to start preparing for the worst with a list of everything you can do to reduce the likelihood of getting caught. that's particularly true if you have children -- the risk of your employees catching a virus like swine flu does not spread from person to person easily -- and a family member of your family is missing out on many of the other things you can do to prevent similar illnesses. most importantly, develop a ""common sense"" plan for the workplace that includes protocols and precautions to avoid any possible cases of the virus. this includes: getting out more of the information -- or whatever other precautions are in place and not in place. remind yourself that the outbreak is real and many health workers and consumers are fearful of contracting the virus. keep your fears in the past, and do not carry panic buttons to the door. reinstating checks at the office will help prevent the appearance of a health concern. that's especially true if you follow the provisions of manufacturer recalls or if work involves heavy-duty manufacturing equipment. being in a strong position to deal with an outbreak can make the difference between surviving or surviving out the next pandemic. 2. embrace energy loss while employees have a great deal of energy to store, regular doses of available energy can diminish the reach of the outbreak and contribute to the danger. taking such energy away from workers may prevent a swine flu outbreak, for example. one suggestion from authorities is to eliminate and recycle any food containers left unattended while workers are indoors. if you choose to keep any food for an extended period, report each time to the director of food services at your local wal-mart. people are well-versed in keeping cool and dry, but it pays to be mindful of your behaviors. try to remember all the things you use, and remember that it's your body's job to keep yourself cool. never, ever take anything while working in a storm -- especially when it's in the early afternoon. 3. take it slow with the coming winter, many farms and workplaces across the country have millions of pounds of dry goods to produce. that's why it's best to know what products you can keep and what food you can store. consider buying items like plastic wrap, jugs and black plastic bottoms from home-made retailers and wholesalers. traveling with some fresh necessities when a campus caddy arrives after a long day at work is more pleasant than staying in the backseat or side dining room. what you may not consider is the inevitable death of your boss. making the adjustment now is easier if you can get it right now. and if you find yourself keeping your cool, bring a turkey (or other small red meat animal for you) or any small food item and prepare it in advance. when prepared properly, it's better to ensure that you're finding small pieces of food that're less in need of removal or keeping them refrigerated and in place during the case of a swine flu outbreak. when you're growing your own food, you can almost always get fewer green juices because more food is needed, so that could help preserve the healthy balance. be aware of what's in a food bag -- and be aware of plenty of other things like frozen fruits, vegetables and canned meats.",grover
467,"Why CNN is calling the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic by tanya agrawal "" more columns late last week, we warned people that we needed to see a few people stricken with a bluish or black patch of the virus in their home as soon as they come out of bed, and warned about it possible for them to get sick. that's usually when there's a pandemic that has sweeping populations and global scale to that point. but there was a possibly contagious infection in one particular location. and that's not just something that you can be very worried about at the moment. most people in need of assistance get it only once or twice in their lives, to be perfectly accurate. if that's the case in my situation, i'd prefer to see someone else isolated and already delirious. these days, more and more people are getting infected. i see it all the time from all directions. i know that sharing needles in my local mall, and why people have had to go to the doctor to find infectious agents, like this form of the flu, is common. but i don't know the reasons why someone just ditches a needle and picks up the very next needle, or something like that. as for how often people would get sick? it varies. as many as three to five times a year. but even if we don't think this has happened to someone as great as me, i'd be surprised if it wasn't more common in an apartment building or conference room, parking lots or parks. it's one of those things you can't usually rely on in an emergency. even if you imagine that's the case, you might not go to the doctor's unless you consider that at least a couple of days after getting sick, that you are less likely to have symptoms. so if you didn't go to the doctor to be diagnosed or keep a medical student in touch with the family, why wouldn't you try the first thing out? i was with my wife last week and her husband was coming home, and we have two young boys. both boys couldn't make it, so we decided to get together before school and catch up on information, and we needed to get some fresh air. and it came around. all about those symptoms. they had so many! and they had so much food and vegetables, although i think i was too young for those things when you become sick. i'm the most famous person in the world because everyone identifies with me. nobody carries it all together just for fame, because people know exactly what's on the other end of the phone, just under the neck of the phone, if i go missing and i know what's happening. we're all in this together, but this has become the most important thing because this affects everybody's life because we feel like we belong. what better way to start an international scare than to say, at a banquet, i may have something to say, and i might offer a concrete course of action? well, that would be something we could all study together for further consideration. that's the kind of thing one can take seriously in emergencies, and hopefully someone can offer as much detail about these types of diseases as possible. and if you actually were to have a medical student in hospital, just tell her, as we don't know how we are living, what you need to know. i don't know how to help you, but to tell her you're staying and saying, ""look, i'm suffering from the flu. am i going to have a cure?"" and it will be there in the end because you're hoping someone might hear about it, in your bid to stop this from happening to you, rather than another epidemic. i'm going to do something with my phone, i'm not going to miss the eight o'clock news tomorrow night. i'm going to share with my viewers how exactly this might be connected to our current pandemic. but when i see someone about it, i have to say, ""wow, this is possibly going to be a new santa claus.""",grover
468,"Syrians are in a desperate race to outrun a brutal regime offensive the syrian government is battling an offensive meant to encircle its sunni muslim stronghold of latakia province as president bashar al-assad loses control of his hometown. but making such an offensive across the country is likely to fail: al-assad must either win outright or the syrian population will grow increasingly disillusioned and excluded from the process. after 11 years of civil war and under arab and international pressure, this january marks the first time since the un-arab league's sanctions imposed on the regime that it has turned to its allies to defend the largest minority in syria's 28-year civil war. over the past three months, at least 18 civilians, military and security personnel, shiite and sunni, and most of the city's sunni population have been killed in the offensive. the regime's soldiers have also been using anti-aircraft missiles to target civilian target areas, artillery and tanks. when president bashar al-assad made the aerial assault last month, it seemed to be a direct attempt to prevent a more bloody day for the syrian people. already, assad's air force has air-dropped heavy weaponry to residents of qaraqosh in northern idlib province. earlier this week, an air defense convoy also bombed some neighbourhoods in the city of aleppo, killing at least 50 people. inside aleppo, streets are ablaze with bodies strewn across them and looting shops. they are suffering from seasonal violence that has killed at least 108 people. just a week after airstrikes killed at least 125 civilians, ali abdulla, the mayor of madaya in northwestern idlib province, was unharmed. since february this year, the city has seen 22 ceasefires for a time, with the most recent involving the cease-fire on march 26. this has eluded the government. all assad's forces have claimed the use of artillery, tanks and mortars to defend himself, since isis in its eastern region of syria gained control of raqqa and then retook parts of the northern city of deir el-zour in october. but each side has an advantage in airstrikes, and the most recent offensive offers civilians an opportunity to gather their memories of their days in a largely empty city, which is a poorer and potentially bloodier place. here is what we know about a timeline of syria's offensive: battle: march 11, 2011 when al-assad was on the verge of winning the popular vote to form a new government in march 2011, his popular front for the liberation of palestine (pflp) was being backed by the arab league, the united states and russia. jihadists were a threat to damascus in the run-up to the april 2011 elections, prompting the leadership of the pflp to issue a gazette notice that they were already in control of town of sharm el-sheikh, ""in anticipation of capturing by the syrian army."" the islamist hizbullah movement was the precursor to the alawite militia, an offshoot of shiite islam, that officially supported assad. the forces of hizbullah now controls many of assad's strongholds in the province of idlib. the forces of hizbullah routed the regime in august 2011 and formed a coalition with the military and foreign fighters of hardline shiite jihadist group hizbullah. this war was televised in which more than 70,000 people died. at the time, hizbullah and hizbullah are considered close allies in the syrian civil war.",grover

472,"UN nuclear watchdog finds Iran has nearly tripled its uranium stockpile dubai, united arab emirates (cnn) — the united nations nuclear watchdog has long recommended the international atomic energy agency develop a longer-term, cross-border verification process to verify iran's compliance with its latest nuclear deal with world powers. but its renewed concerns regarding tehran are mainly because iran was singled out by the iaea for so long, allocating 2.2 metric tons of their highly enriched uranium to iran this year — nearly nine times the previous year's allocation. in recent days, critics in the iaea made pushbacks about the iaea's overall findings, including whether iran had indeed diverted some of the uranium to its main supplier, or an additional amount. the objections came amid arguments in europe and north korea over the wisdom of iranian president hassan rouhani's hard-line stance toward the west and the future of the nuclear agreement, despite a u.s. supreme court decision to uphold the deal that specifies iran's nuclear activity will be restricted to peaceful purposes and not military, part of a negotiated nuclear deal. in its july report, the iaea found iran was sharing still more than 2 metric tons of its enriched uranium to kazakhstan.

""if you wait too long, it will find itself telling israelis and palestinians that 'lionel, it's no longer the end of the road'."" netanyahu said. the joint statement, released earlier on sunday after a state department media briefing, said trump's proposal does not undermine or decrease the ""shifting international authority on jerusalem,"" where israel holds most of the land around the jewish city. under the new proposal, a palestinian state will be created in exchange for an agreement that can be made by a negotiated palestinian-israeli two-state peace process. it also would recognise jerusalem as israel's capital, bypassing regional and international agreements that had rejected it and offered to deal with ""the east jerusalem issue"". ""the states parties agree not to advance the onus of finding a middle ground and to make it clear that our method of settlement is the direction the palestinian and israeli governments are heading,"" the statement said. trump, trump, trump: we're open to negotiation. we have ideas. trump, trump: if you want the palestinians to get the money and leave israel, we'll talk about it,"" netanyahu's press secretary, sean spicer, said following trump's policy announcement. mixed results a week ago, trump denied the progress made in the negotiations, saying: ""we've been on slow-game, all indications of failure for what would have been years, so you probably agree with me."" netanyahu, meanwhile, says the conflict created by israel's annexation of the west bank, east jerusalem and any area it had lived in for decades will be resolved. israel and its allies claim a palestinian state under islamic law is a final claim. it is the first time since the 1960s that the two sides have reached an agreement. netanyahu has said only that an agreement made by trump and netanyahu included regional cooperation between israel and the palestinians. the jerusalem post on friday said israel and the palestinians reached a preliminary agreement on april 1 in the presence of a group of 100 top figures from abbas' fatah, a militant group believed to be planning its own interim peace proposal for an israeli-palestinian state. palestinians want east jerusalem, occupied since an army offensive in 1967, to be an independent and unified capital. in a stark rebuke to trump's move, the u.s. ambassador to the united nations, nikki haley, said trump was trying to shift american policy and destroy the budding ties between the two sides. the trump administration had accused jordan and israel, claiming that abbas was meddling in middle east peace negotiations with his offer of sanctuary from washington to ""colonialist"" states like saudi arabia and the united arab emirates. watch: jerusalem austeria - key statements on the u.s. plan to withdraw u.s. forces from middle east: https://t.co/ddgixnehf pic.twitter.com/en54xdwzab — cnn (@cnn) april 3, 2017 trump's proposal would also cut egypt's peace agreement with israel. it provides security aid and provides recommendations about policing, intelligence cooperation and efforts to deal with organized crime. briana kearok cnn's brianna keilar and paparazzi's molly smith contributed to this report.",grover

489,"Source: Trump is concerned about coming into contact with people infected with coronavirus somebody heard donald trump speak this week about placing special tariffs on all types of vaccines. at least, that is what some scientists theorized during a confirmation hearing, noting the president's promise about using a different government's resources to improve vaccines. it is possible president trump made his controversial message from a cave in his congressional campaign more serious than it was. but even putting that aside, what prompted the more serious worry for his administration, his twitter followers, may be whether he intends to apply the same level of anti-vaxxer safety as he did when he threw out the pr bomb of a year ago. and that concern has finally become infinitesimal. the white house press corps had already been reluctant to opine on the president's call for tariffs, except to link it to the terrible record he's produced, which already inspires incessant follow-up questions, just as he has led the republican party's worst backlash to his presidency. then the fact he suddenly declared he wants to impose a 15% tariff on all vaccines and he could make health-care advocates question this or any administration's practice of putting a price on health care. that's the miracle cure for those who shrieked ""whooooooooo!"" at the moment. when he was asked for evidence that the vaccines were safely performing, he did not mention the department. after all, the vaccine industry's mega-billion-dollar revenue stream has been ferried out by government snooping. as stephen chait notes at slate, this only makes the pronouncement more believable. apparently the white house believes that if it can get new levels of vaccinations to work then the trade penalties of one out of three-disease reduction program could be worthwhile. trump had reportedly given a talk last week with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, who is a growing group of russian and south american leaders eager to stake their claim on an issue with a willing nuclear foe. what makes these allies even more alarming, though, is that the white house campaign promise was not one that trump himself explicitly announced, simply a plan to ""increase the amount of vaccines we sell in each market."" just as importantly, the question was about the threshold for yet another round of tariffs. after all, president trump had once touted that, once he made his decision, there would be a ""larger global health market."" he claimed the trump administration was not a country trying to be a trade war with china, but instead would increase the global, trade-based market as the russian government mulls, or reconsiders, its own portfolio. at some point this rubber ducks, as trump comes up with a plan to increase the rate of vaccine rebates, but it is true that the rhetoric on those front will never test the president's political will. though it could go on for years, the best justification for trump making his controversial claim is that his announcement could help spark a greater global trend away from the horrors inflicted by the cold war and more on issues with serious consequences. it's all too easy to pontificate ""come, us, whatever, we're for all kinds of vaccines."" it's just ""our"" vaccine industry. yet, more interesting than the exemption-seeking rhetoric and, well, the hypocrisy of making such a denunciation, trump's ""good friend"" prakash jha recently quipped, ""i don't care about the public sector."" if that was the case, why is it so hard to interpret trump's ""good friend"" comments as more about remaining after all those years of #maga and trump's bad in the world?",grover

""tens of thousands of elephants here will be lost."" africa's elephants are the world's second-largest rhino. while they have always been poorly conserved and are on a steady decline, this means that gushing resources such as elephants' breeding facilities can be secured. yet experts warn that if the poachers and the government don't act together, ""the reserves of these amazing elephants are already at danger."" in a quick analysis of the fatal poaching attacks, africa's institute for conservation and derivatives indicates the two groups are technically two sides of the same coin. when poaching occurs, the poachers do: * a female elephant, which has already been killed by rhino attack, will have accumulated 1,400 square miles (1,000 square km) of habitat, about 90 percent of which is untouched by humans. * a male bull elephant attacked with iron rods (a kind of explosive metal that can explode in a struggle for space) will have accumulated 745 square miles (1,000 square km) of habitat, about one-third of which is untouched by humans. * a female elephant attacked by a beef deer attacked with bamboo poles will have accumulated more than 4,000 square miles (up to 2,000 square km) of habitat, about half the terrain of other african elephants. if the giraffe and other male elephants are still roaming out to sea (winds of 110 mph or higher), that means the national transitional council or ntc should seek protection for all of them, said the regional expert mohamed anani. ""the government of tanzania had an idea but this was a phenomenon it didn't understand how it would actually protect elephants,"" he said. beyond the potential danger posed by elephant poaching to great shaloo — the country's most-populous park and just 120 kilometers (75 miles) from kibinyi airport — is what experts fear most — the chance to catch poachers and the horns they often spray onto giraffes. ""they use huge amounts of steroids to kill giraffes,"" said rufus mynmthakisema, a wildlife and conservation adviser at kenya's national parks and wildlife department. ""that kind of taking advantage of an animal will have a psychological effect. the result will be that there will be physical damage to the animals."" poachers are also often propelled by anger — raising the cost of fighting the brutal campaigns of poachers that continue to permeate africa today. in rwanda's paul kagame government, an aggressive poacher tries to shoot up to 100 animals a day, according to government figures, killing hundreds of thousands of animals. the government has in the past tried to equip the country's elephants with cameras to be used as a hedge against poaching, but is failing to do so, according to ruhu humanitarian action network. ""this is a country without elephants and they suffer from unplanned violence because of lack of research and insurance,"" said ruhu national environmental coordinator mohammed wainaye.",grover

""there may be a number of deaths from the ebola outbreaks, based on different models, other data related to the epidemiology of disease transmission,"" carreras said in a phone interview from the ebola capital of west africa. the ebola virus, which the world health organization said originated in guinea in 2014, was born in west africa after an ebola epidemic that sickened at least 5,000 people, sickened hundreds more, then spread to neighboring countries. yet, carreras cautioned that ""most of these countries are not experiencing outbreaks. if the outbreak are strong enough for it to continue, and it continues, people may live longer and perhaps die more often than the diagnosis indicated."" more than 120 cases have been reported so far in all of west africa, but there have been around 250 deaths, said dr. indira vamil, a public health consultant and african expert at who, at a news conference. the world health organization says that roughly 1 million people have died from ebola transmission so far, mostly in west africa.

""but now the potential is gone. the outbreak is spreading more rapidly,"" said vanderbilt university epidemiologist dr. fumiko yamazaki. carreras, who trained international workers in zika outbreaks in 2014, said on thursday that the federal government should declare major symptoms during ebola alerts -- known as zika outbreaks -- or flu that would be isolated and contagious. his group sees the virus as susceptible to damage and vulnerability and has documented more than 70 cases of transmission, while diagnosing brain infections as ebola virus, known as perfluorooctano syndrome. he said that screening indicates just five hospitalizations or at least 250 confirmed cases of ebola, and a large number of cases should be diagnosed before treatment is sought in a short period of time. in a south africa case, patients are located on the recommendation of a single healthcare official at a public hospital after not knowing the symptoms for more than a week. experts also point out that new cases of ebola in the united states, where infection rates remain low, are unlikely to infect consumers, while the number of potential west african cases per 100,000 people -- higher than that of ebola in guinea -- indicate ebola is spread over two-thirds of the world's territories.

""if anyone would have taken to it more carefully it would have happened in less than a minute and there could have been fatalities,"" said lucile ohmyer, the ceo of the civil aviation authority of south africa, the authority in charge of overseeing aviation in south africa. ""our main concern is to make sure that the crash does not continue to be a tragedy, and that passengers and safety are being protected and that we take the best care of them."" airbus said it was investigating the accident. the airbus a320 aircraft has been one of the most popular jets in south africa — an aviation rarity — for many years and carries more than 2,000 passengers per flight, according to industry figures. south africa is home to thousands of aircraft built in the past 15 years. they include boeing 737-800s, airbus a350s, boeing cseries planes and boeing cessna 208s and others. each of the a320's eight cogs suffer from loss of altitude when turning down altitude. that can lead to a collision with an engine attached to the aircraft. the pilot of the plane or another passenger died as a result of that ejection. south africa's civil aviation agency is among the most stringent in the world with high-tech standards aimed at ensuring flight safety. the a320 had been refuelling, when it was destroyed in an airplane crash in the western libyan city of sirte on monday, officials said. the planemaker noted that none of the a320 crew survived the collision. however, it will test out the plane for flight safety tests and have the aircraft equipped to react to the difference between altitude and high flight.",grover

""good mathematics isn't a hobby,"" yuhui tells the guardian. ""it's a passion."" she's happy to share with us how we tested and accomplished that question. we've asked her for more details about the hardware for which she has made some useful choices. the first is for a folding model of the carmaker. she suggested extending the car's life for a long time to allow for its possibility to replace conventional wheels. another suggestion for a new model might be for fans of displays to make way for even newer displays such as vending machines or sporting equipment. instead of sending your children to school thinking you have to set an alarm each morning or wake up four hours before they get in the house, the choruses would be able to make use of the internet to alert people that you're running late. so of course, as soon as you hit the road you'd be in the better mood to answer your call. as with the calculator, all the choruses are distributed on different sizes and, depending on which retailer you go to, you'd be able to create a whole variety of models based on the learning a new code involved. for each random contact, a joker would make repeated moves, or you'd want to cut a quick google-code spreadsheet in 30 seconds. not only that, but players could simply lift large toys into mass-produced sizes. for those people who probably don't know how a calculator works, consider the tiny size of a plasma tv. the analog entry in tv sets in ""video games"" that you buy for example is spaced a few inches apart, whereas in smartphones they cross the same separation. and when we look at the diagram, it's just one piece of wonderful technology: small screens. i've used tv models in my spare time, but not on our standard commute. i, quite frankly, have no idea how to illustrate maths steps or even understand them. as i wrote in an article last week about yuhui's innovation, ""a study has put the process of constructing a choruses on the internet behind pure mathematics steps."" given the interest in maths equations it's safe to say you don't have to face the maths problems of your dreams.",grover

""this plant is reaching the taste of the tea plant and its inhabitants around the world,"" sarah burra, head of operations at cfb south africa planting facility, said in a statement. and what's true for the world, you may not even know it's true. burra says the plant's other potent, fresh fruit, called chambadensis, is its best thing: a small bite of heavy, naturally strong bitter, sweet tea can make a hefty amount of tea time. ""this plant has its own unique unique fruit. chambadensis is similar to (10 tablespoons of) pomegranate, or madagascar cinnamon tea,"" the cfb south africa planting facility official told cnn last year. the official even called the plant ""the first produce plant in south africa built around a cheap, underground trench where the two species live in harmony,"" according to cnn.

""this partnership is the perfect opportunity to help californians become successful recipients of the most basic public services,"" jon leitner, president of the league, said in a statement. the los angeles shelter business ""has been the conduit through which homelessness and global warming have been established through devastating mountaintop stormwater runoff loss,"" he said, calling the programs that have delivered protection, meals and thrift stores ""both critical public health issues in and around our cities."" the shelters house roughly 16,000 californians without permanent housing in the state, according to the california national guard. because los angeles is the county with the largest population, they typically house only the most severely traumatized.

529,"These states have been hit the hardest by coronavirus. Here's what they're doing to fight the spread it's the climate it seems, but there are heretofore no vaccines to combat coronavirus virus. until recently. after a spike in hiv cases in 2016 that killed a who-accredited cancer specialist, researchers set up a partnership with the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) to focus on detecting and fighting the virus. and now, two states have been the victim of what the cdc called a record-breaking outbreak of coronavirus. in a release wednesday, cdc said the outbreak now threatens only 5,900 people from four states, and 1,753 more are infected since the outbreak started. preventing coronavirus outbreaks that's the ""worst outbreak ever,"" the cdc said. it has already claimed 300 lives so far, and so far this year it claims almost 170 people from 11 states including new york, connecticut, massachusetts, new jersey, pennsylvania, nevada, new mexico, washington, and minnesota. the cdc estimates this outbreak could be the most serious coronavirus case recorded since 2003, when it shot down more than half a dozen infections across the united states and canada. the outbreak affects 2.1 million people worldwide, up from 52,290 in 2013, when it caused 145 deaths and nearly 750,000 infections. ""coronavirus's deadly history is now inextricably linked to our lack of effective therapeutics for the prevention of people with viral and respiratory diseases and other illnesses,"" cdc administrator dr. tom frieden said in a statement. but while older people are more likely to become infected, there's another major contribution they may do. it adds up to many people of low incomes, including one study has shown that elderly people have a 23% chance of having died from coronavirus, compared to those of the general population. the cdc said this outbreak is the sixth in six years of high-risk outbreaks, with the fewest detected cases since the agency started the effort in 2002. under severe pressure and yet, people are still dying from infecting their pets or other personal pets. so where's the help? in a statement, dr. scott aylwin, cdc's chief scientific officer, called the current outbreak an ""unprecedented"" situation. ""when we look at a vaccine, we think we know how to keep that person alive,"" aylwin said. ""and when we evaluate how effective we do that, we see that we need the right vaccines and what's best for our patients."" that, aylwin said, includes an effective vaccine against major viruses. last year, who and the cdc partnered on a vaccine that blocked two major deadly viruses: the h7n9 flu virus and the jrs pandemic flu strain. but only 43 of the vaccines can stop the virus from attacking human beings and that hasn't stopped the most deadly. that deficiency is what puts the disease at risk. second-hand blood exposure can cause severe bleeding and be fatal if untreated. and in rare cases, the virus even passes through your liver. symptoms can include rashes, fever, fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea, and even bleeding red blood cells. for people living alone, death is the number one killer. for older people, it is the second-most deadly, aylwin said. the cdc said it will offer an emergency help line at 800-901-8305, through the agency's national center for transplantation, or ncta. a can also call 211 if they are eligible to receive a new type of heart or lung transplant.

530,"How US spy agencies are tracking the coronavirus pandemic with one infectious disease killing 2,300 people a year in 20 countries, it's easy to forget about the 11 remaining pandemics. a september 2015 cdc study found that only 4% of the world's outbreak victims had been vaccinated, but 28% of those who did get vaccinated never got sick from it. the copenhagen institute for infectious diseases and prevention of the u.n. environment committee notes, ""the climate emergency that is climate change has reached peak effects of the pandemic. the full-blown human-poisoned pandemic could spread to the entire world in its wake."" a key question posed to the 2014 americans with disabilities act is: how do we prevent pandemics from happening to humans? well, one step can be taken at the risk of human-poisoned humans getting sick: to educate families about the potentially disastrous consequences of a widespread pandemic. for example, children between the ages of 6 to 13 are particularly susceptible to all the viruses that might make their way into a world pandemic. for this reason, world health organization representatives are developing a vaccine. this vaccination program can also be used in developing health care systems to help fight the spread of pandemics through immunization campaigns. in the six states that have mandated the vaccine for use, it's estimated at around $900 million, or roughly 20% of the total anti-pandemic cancer vaccine budget for each year until 2029. ""global vaccination rates are falling, and social support has often come at the expense of early and serious disease development,"" says dr. danilio davidi, chair of the who global vaccine program in the global immunization study. through the ""adaptive insurance program,"" u.s. children could buy immunization kits that provide the vaccines to themselves and their children of their own choosing. all immunizations in this plan have to be affordable and effective in order to qualify for the free vaccine program. this affordable insurance program and additional funding are needed now more than ever. ""the vaccine supply is still dwindling and there will not be enough vaccines for every outbreak of pneumonia,"" davidi says. ""it takes money from other government agencies and huge donors to purchase vaccines for every outbreak."" so how do we encourage immunization? with the current u.s. effort to eradicate polio, this means policymakers need to put their best foot forward to help a few million citizens who are suffering from polio in areas where they were previously protected. the health people in these countries need to be vaccinated against an earlier, possibly more imminent pandemic than the ones we previously protected. this means immunizing young people who may have suffered childhood polio, or even those at a high risk, by preventing them from getting sick, and encouraging their children to be vaccinated. anti-pandemic vaccine programs are already popular in countries where there is strong public vaccination, particularly those with polio as well as care and education programs. many countries around the world offer vaccine coverage to children at lower and higher rates than the usa, so this system will help make sure children are vaccinated if they're exposed to anti-pandemic infectious diseases. this may sound overwhelming, but the fight against global pandemics will take a long time, and no one should hesitate to vaccinate their children. dr. daniel meacham is senior manager for global public health at the world health organization.",grover

""after 24 years, in our little lab, they really have learned to consume the same more potent tumor toxin as the other group, which we don't think is likely,"" said delue. researchers see common, biological traits of the aerocotin bug as a strong double-edged sword in a small number of high-risk patients, he said.

""we want to make sure that the pet is safe, humane and happy to be adopted by the other partner who will be caring for them. people might think that something goes wrong after someone dies; in fact, even animal cruelty does not necessarily guarantee a dog or cat will have a complete life because it's difficult to find an owner who can take care of them,"" states courtney. unlike some nonprofits, a doctor is involved in a ""survival tour"" for people with terminal illnesses, including those who have become pets. customers fill out paperwork including documents for the adoption, including vet bills and paperwork for the family pet.",grover

""(the defendants) threatened the victim with severe emotional distress and enhanced fear, (if) they (over) the years dismissed their fraud claims,"" the indictment states. ultimately, the suspects took their victim down a list of 31 such identities, the indictment states. they then obtained fraudulent transactions from the victims and gradually re-upped the charge against one individual. ""further actions were taken by the defendants to garnish the victim's wages, and to attach collateral collateral for loans secured by the suspects' newly acquired hsbc accounts,"" the indictment states. the banks did not immediately respond to cnn's request for comment. the fraudsters named in the latest complaint, admitted to filing a false pretense complaint from march 17 to april 5, while in march they appealed a denial of their final pretense claim. ""the defendant bank fraud scheme was ... devised through the belief that the only other victims of fraud are banks and the accused fraudsters were hsbc employees,"" the indictment states. in december 2017, hsbc and nassau provincial police jointly investigated the fraud. the case was part of the investigation dubbed ncooc 2012. while the three have been convicted in the latest fraud complaint, this no longer is as bad as it first thought.",grover

""hopefully, by testing our baby carriers, we'll be able to get more babies who have trouble breathing into the nicu,"" dr. maria driscoll, a cardiac surgeon at saint joseph, said at the news conference. to help the hospital track that health statistic, saint joseph partnered with nonprofit nonprofit children's development partners to provide the reading service for families with developmental disabilities. dr. fitzenhagen said the goal is to compile a database of children's health data that can be used to manage baby carriers' health — and might catch people suffering from behavioral disorders who don't have access to support services.

""we believe that being educated on beauty, wellness and wellness is life-changer."" the story of the woman who lost her voice to cancer in 2012, for which she became famous, can't be told without listening, and when the story goes to print, she wants to know what she did before launching her business. ramsey felt health was a priority in her last year at school. her kids stayed away from her for periods while she underwent surgery to treat stage iv breast cancer in 2013. her 2014 procedure was the subject of an impassioned debate between her and her husband about whether he would be best person to make her money. ramsey found herself having to confront the idea she wasn't likely to be able to afford another procedure if she went forward, and the reality she faced when she landed a job in the great city jobs website as a fashion designer at harper's bazaar. ""it's hard for me to believe something i know about now that they've seen and heard,"" she said. ""this is my life."" ramsey was able to work with the charity smashbox to raise funds for the skin institute, a nonprofit that helps women overcome the effects of severe body dysmorphia and plastic surgery while working toward becoming successful women. while she does not think there is any way she can break the glass ceiling at smashbox to pay it forward, the idea of a business in which people have collective voices made it onto the scene, such as when yoga promoter, metrot in calabasas, decided to run her own business, has made her believe the post office is bigger than them.",grover

581,"Health officials often turn to praising Trump when facing tough coronavirus questions chicago -- it's almost a compulsory part of obamacare. because the american health care act just passed the nation's highest court, health insurers and administrators are less likely to criticize president donald trump when public officials are facing questions about new viruses that cause respiratory illnesses. the challenge is complicated, as health advocates are pushing the administration to change how it uses official praise. in january, for example, the tribune reported that republican senate leaders had invited alaska gov. mark begich to appear at trump's mar-a-lago resort to discuss what health experts called the ""health coverage contamination initiative"" they had put in place after discovering a second flu case in the state. ""in the spirit of decent government, president trump should step up and apologize for the perceived 'unnecessary' criticism,"" wrote logan featherstone, the co-founder of the group health care for america now, a washington-based group opposed to big government. the national institute on environmental healthyhood, which administers the act, allowed trump to get his views known in february and joined seven other republicans, including illinois attorney general lisa madigan, in slapping tariffs on imports of non-melanoma skin cancers. that prompted criticism, echoing language the trump administration has used to demand and continue pressure on trump to stop the $29 billion to $50 billion this year in $18 billion tariffs imposed on imported parts of the country's largest supplier. the administration has not only refused to commit to committing to ending those tariffs, but trump has also shown impatience with the unwillingness of democratic senators to take swift action, according to politico. in recent weeks, trump has said he wants to reinstate the tariffs by the end of this year, despite democrats' complaints and the administration's seeming lack of responsiveness on the matter. the health organization agrees that endorsing the president's remarks is a small step in the direction of restoring public trust.

""people are looking for allies and they seem to be choosing whoever they think is the best person to work with."" health advocates hope the administration plans to take a more aggressive stance on health care and improve public perception of how the health care system works. until recently, health advocates had suggested that environmental workers were not some other kind of human being and that the u.s. environmental protection agency should designate the gulf coast region as an example of a country that could take serious steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. but newly aware lawmakers, the administration and environmental organizations have taken steps in recent months to overhaul epa under former administrator scott pruitt. the epa's climate action plan, for example, offered a new set of rules for decontaminating fossil fuels, but pruitt had been more receptive to the idea. still, critics say pruitt and its epa directors have prioritized leaking information about potential health problems of the epa's agencies, mainly from leaks of agricultural practices. in response to criticism about pruitt's shrinking role in epa, the epa issued a public statement saying the environmental agency ""will continue to work with officials in the american public on the country's most important health priorities and will be open to information and input from the public."" with few options available to trump, health advocates believe it's difficult for the administration to make any changes that won't be divisive, since the aca requires all insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions and requires insurers to offer coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. the aca, which trump inherited from his predecessor, is a complicated law with many questions to be answered, some written before anyone had read it. it's designed to protect americans from the pitfalls of obamacare, and it has worked, but some say it's a lousy health care system, because of its high costs and dangers. the act also requires medical assistance for those suffering from the condition that poses a significant financial risk to taxpayers. those health insurance policies can have higher premiums than medical insurance, prompting a backlash.",grover
582,"Here's what Trump's coronavirus emergency declaration does washington — president donald trump declared a state of emergency to move forward with his plan to defuse a deadly outbreak of deadly salmonella bacteria. the declaration is part of a new effort by white house chief of staff john kelly, the dea chief, the white house physician, the office of dietary supplements and the usda's bureau of livestock. the declaration is designed to enable trump to win public and congressional approval of his plan by friday. details of the declaration are under wraps. the white house also had not revealed details about trump's other emergency plans. trump called for the declaration in his state of the union address, warning that salmonella is ""reckless"" and ""causing massive suffering among our loved ones and nation's health and welfare."" the nation's top veterinarian advised the president to take the ""necessary actions and move forward ... in any way that can help stop this horrible illness."" the official statements about the emergency declaration monday from the white house and the dea did not provide details about the president's ""support for a world of greater and better food for all,"" nor what trump's plan would look like. salmonella is linked to cases in more than 600,000 people in the united states and more than 65,000 people worldwide. salmonella is found in many packaged foods including unprocessed meats and poultry and now can cause a variety of illnesses including diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever. symptoms can last from three to six weeks. rice and other poultry are the most prevalent victims of salmonella. on friday, trump declared a state of emergency so he could shift the blame for the outbreak to what's known as the ""big 3"" — the meat-eaters, manufacturers and meat-processing companies. two salmonella outbreaks in 2010 — one in california and one in florida — blamed stocks of unsafe food and contaminated food products at grocery stores and food-processing plants in the united states. the 2001 cases were linked to salmonella outbreak traced to the ground beef of beef world in california. trump's order calls for him to declare a state of emergency, which would happen no matter what triggers it. the first public declaration of a state of emergency was necessary to impose federal regulation on food products, a means by which the authority is extended. that was allowed as long as the order was ""reasonably probable"" and ""certainly was not unduly adverse to national security or public health."" the list of probable actions could include unannounced inspections, suspension of imports and the issuance of a release of a state of emergency. a third option is to ask the u.s. supreme court to declare a state of emergency in response to ""preventable, preventable or at all cost to the national security and public health of our citizens,"" the white house said in a statement. ""we must focus on 'protecting' our citizens with checks and balances, just as we do our allies and all of those other things we support,"" trump said in his state of the union address. in october, an advisory panel of experts from the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention agreed that a stockpile of salmonella-tainted chicken may not contain enough ""clean"" raw chicken that can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal cramps. the panel found that an active ingredient in chicken was in ""almost every piece of chicken."" the cdc earlier this year announced it was establishing a forensic control center at the national center for missing and exploited children in dallas to investigate the chain of illnesses. ____ associated press writer amy forliti contributed to this report.",grover

""as i've told you before, i'll never lie to you. i promise. i will never tell you that. and i'll never apologize for that,"" said no. 31, chuckling. the run-up to sunday's televised debate of the democratic presidential candidates is considered one of trump's biggest draws in early april. while sanders has long advocated taking the fight to the ""voter suppression"" of the 2016 elections and the ongoing health care debate, he has received critical support from the sanders camp in the last two days of the primary — including a half-hour interview in which the vermont senator predicted sanders would win the election. on sunday, sanders met with new york city mayor bill de blasio and state sen. dan squadron, the wife of former newark mayor cory booker, to continue the conversation on voting rights, health care and immigration. the outreach to the sanders camp comes after other candidates, including george w. bush and john kerry, also gathered national attention for their critiques of the trump campaign. de blasio, who has yet to officially endorse trump, speaks at the white house on sunday and is expected to visit the white house on monday. but despite being closely aligned with sanders, the vermont senator has been considered for a slew of positions. among those: democratic national committee chairman jim messina. philadelphia mayor jim kenney. a few weeks ago, sanders took to twitter to address a burning issue: ""was never supposed to be an adviser in the beginning; let's move is a movement where everyone but donald trump and hillary clinton can work together. focus on kids and families. stop lying."" sen. kirsten gillibrand, d-n.y., is also weighing a presidential bid, said michelle cole, spokeswoman for gillibrand. the senator has stated her intention to run in 2020 and is working with the party on creating a working group to help candidates create awareness of their proposals and their political action committee plans, a campaign staffer said. gov. chris christie, r-n.j., offered to campaign for no. 31 in a letter endorsing his effort. sanders, ben carson, paul ryan, r-wis., and bill de blasio have all taken pitches from the campaign. de blasio is said to be finalizing details of several political events that are planned for the new york delegation this weekend. he will get a tour of the former westchester county executive charlie branca's home before heading to the campaign trail. team sanders has been sending the secretary of state's office a month of campaign updates, and kennedy even makes an appearance with the democratic national committee. a new jersey delegate reported the news in a tweet that morning: ""sen. bernie sanders and ted cruz are gearing up for the primary & declaring their intention to run in the general. serious candidates and lots of support have been pouring in to help us build their campaign!"" vermont gov. tom kean has said he is optimistic about the potential of the vermont senator. he tweeted on saturday: ""we are building a strong team. we have knocked on 600 doors so far and got a huge amount of support."" one democratic source said sanders ""seems to have seen the writing on the wall.""

(0400 gmt on saturday) on the u.s. mainland. north korea said it threw a military missile into the sea near the southeastern border of south korea thursday, south korea's military said friday. north korea also claimed that it fired a ballistic missile from the east coast of the korean peninsula thursday, an apparent claim it said was confirmed by satellite images. the north said that an unscrewed hatchet to a piece of metal was used to the remains of its cargo vessel, fiery cross, and therefore intentionally caused the remains to be repatriated in the village of loon, south of the korean peninsula, said kim myung-sub, deputy director of the defense ministry's chemical, rocket and explosives commission. south korea's warplanes, navy ships and artillery fighters conducted tests off the north's east coast and conducted aerial reconnaissance activities in the area. the next threat system north korea might build for its missile and nuclear tests is designed to prepare its units for a attack, according to a senior u.s. navy officer. north korea's national ballistic missile (bm) program has been struggling for years and the establishment of such an experiment with defensive systems against united states or other possible adversaries has been paramount to the development and testing of the missile. prior to this test, a small rocket, or missile that cannot be independently verified as an operational force, was launched by the busan-based north on april 2 to simulate an attack on south korea. after that, it would have flown into the territory of guam. north korea carried out another successful test of its new warhead in 2017, which it tested by taking back one on the test range. the missile is ""very effective"" in its ""conventional"" electromagnetic pulse (emp) range, which is designed to allow it to reach the south and reach north korea from major ports, according to cxo young-sun, head of the us-based non-proliferation program at the world foundation in beijing. the obama administration launched a missile defence system that would defend the u.s. against north korea's threats to strike the pacific. north korea first tested a long-range missile in 2017 that flew roughly 9,000 miles (11,000 kilometers). senior trump administration officials indicated on thursday that the administration plans to deploy the terminal high altitude area defense (thaad) system to launch ballistic missiles from within north korea.",grover

""we know what happened with this fungus,"" sara baker, a professor at the indiana university bloomington school of public health in indiana, told cnn's crime lab. ""this is a mass outbreak. it's sort of extraordinary."" there are likely to be a broader group of new infections and longer incubation periods for the person causing the initial outbreak, but she cautioned that the number of people who begin to contract the illness could be much larger than the old doomsday, and explains why high awareness is needed. to shut the door on entry, doctors use these detectors to indicate the location of a water leak or that there is bacteria. though hsc sets the alarm on a case per day at least twice a week, that time in mid-february is the most intensive part of the outbreak, which happened on the islands of hilo and sapporo between february and march. in january, hawaii confirmed an e. coli outbreak that has infected 21 people, where samples were sent to the cdc for testing. in the most recent outbreak, e. coli infection in three others appeared late in the spring and on feb. 9 were confirmed in two people, who ended up in a nearby hospital. the new e. colis are very close to the oldest-known signs of the virus. most have yet to be tested for the virus, but have been confirmed as having caught the disease from an e. coli generated by japan or china. some days, for example, a patient who was at the main hospital in frankfurt but given antibiotics died, according to a study released by the german ministry of health. until now, the most plausible explanation for the outbreak was in part from the sheer scale of the global cluster of cases: 13.6 million people and 10.9 million cases globally. ""this new e. coli outbreak places a huge demand on the future medical standard of care in terms of laboratory screening and diagnosis,"" said dr. oliver gilman, director of the cdc's national center for health statistics. those measures have likely prevented more than 1,200 e. coli cases from a year earlier. last month, the world health organization declared an outbreak in japan to be linked to an e. coli strain, but the actual number of infections was considerably lower.",grover

""february is like a very protracted, serious crisis because the monsoon season is already beginning and which means there's a lot of rain and potentially some beneficial tetracyclines,"" emoto said. the new curbing is yet another bite into the rotation of the banana crop that has grown rapidly since the rainy season began in november 2014. blasco, the crop in caracas state where the central government controls the water system, is one of the most important crops in venezuela, accounting for almost 25% of the world's bananas. the new curbing is aimed at curbing the growing influence of the brackish brackish water in northwestern venezuela, the westmost port of the sultana highway known for a booming rice harvest. farmers have exported brackish brackish water from neighboring provinces near caracas to avoid brazil, a country in which the rain is usually deficient. vanilla cup transportation of brackish brackish water supplies to the venezuelan capital, caracas, have been increased since the drug violence of 2016. the government is planning to begin shipments soon. farms of bananas near caracas have been threatened with closure because of the increased quantities of brackish water destined for other rivers in the country. the government banned brackish importation in 2014. that ban was lifted in 2016, after a caravan carrying laborers, farmers and employees of local textile factories stepped over a black-and-yellow tank on which the water was stored, giving smugglers a ride to pick up the materials from nearby waterways. caracas' regional governor, gustavo hurtado, is tasked with supervising the rollout of the ban on brackish water shipments. if the ban continues as planned, production from the illegal crops in the highway that runs from caracas to the port of aragua will decline, hurtado said. in recent months, the move has been met with protests from banana farmers who said they suffered real losses due to damaged crops and panicked tourists leaving their tourist zone. organizations such as the bolivarian alliance for the colonization and the national congress of south america (acsa) and américa móvil — whose work includes producing bananas, sugarcane and peaches, among other fruits — say they don't have enough of the 15,000 people in the country to function normally. chavez and his brother, hugo chávez, are longtime supporters of his socialist ""liberty and socialism,"" which would be in effect a national independence and peace initiative if chavez and his opponents were to lose their house of representatives and ensure the continuation of the socialist movement. the formal launch of the new curbing order comes as negotiations on a new deal between chávez and his fellow members of his ruling national guard, the supreme army, are ongoing. the government has said that it is still mulling the merits of the pact. the government's monday decision to cut the import of industrial water from baja state and delay the shipment of extra brackish water to aragua through late spring has been met with speculation that the plan will end up easing the tensions around the regional dispute. experts say the demand from mexico to allow the delivery of up to 2,000 tons of the extra brackish water to the region is a significant blow to the country's central demand to increase its ability to reduce its dependence on its exports, said saul murillo, an expert on tropical agriculture at the institute of agricultural education in cuba.",grover

""i could no longer carry this train because i felt left out in the wrong place,"" said one of the passengers, ogun dazonawase, 84. for the former slum dweller and local gym teacher, the plan was also to find a way to ferry his kids to and from school. ultimately, then-japanese prime minister taro aso ""snapped"" oda, a socialist, in the corner, thanks to an innovative japanese concept. ""i want young people to be involved in japan, they don't know why japan came. they only know the country. they've been living there for centuries,"" oda said at the time. lion water rescue: ratgy's fiesta tokyo's tramroad also turned out to be a touchstone of cultural identity. during the second world war, before japanese imperial rule, japan's first tramway was situated between the eastern cities of tokyo and amagio. it was very popular for japan's cyclists, who could fit in the huge facilities and stations that used to be iron houses and warehouses. inside the airport was a tram center, where japanese men were given large bags to give to their elderly citizens. and more than once in the 20th century, workers have cleaned the crowds' cities of scant bits of rubbish to eliminate the unintentional firewood, which eventually ended up in the water catchment. but just three weeks ago, after a long, successful campaign to clean tokyo's streets and parks, the mayor apologized to rail riders. austerity deal: take the drink when japanese cars don't have work delivered, they come with tax on a number of items. nearly 17,000 kilos of beer came from 41 breweries in the past year.

624,"US cities are losing 36 million trees a year. Here's why it matters and how you can stop it explain how and where is too expensive to spend on trees and really complain about ""being shortsighted?"" calls from environmentalists have jumped onto the debate over where the trees are coming from. early this year, the us government announced several bird-friendly measures that aim to reduce trees that drift on land, such as clearing up trees that overgrowth, interfering with traffic patterns, environmental problems and wildlife. it's an interesting line of action because most greenbacks have died off in recent years thanks to very different factors. first, it's about trees. right now, us cities are losing one-third of their trees each year due to growing vegetation, environmental concerns, human activity, and their overwhelming natural resources. these chemicals, biological agents, and the like can change the shape and fabric of life. in other words, during the past eight years, the us has lost one-third of its trees and tree fibers. if you want to fight back, make sure you clean up all the garbage in your neighborhood every year, or otherwise knock trees down. second, of course, if you're a homeowner or business, don't go for waste-buying schemes like planting trees. if you're trying to buy some down payment for a house or even your town's park, and you make a bid for somebody other than someone, you won't get everything in return. get out of this housing game, america's city-by-city map is a website, and it also lists communities that offer practical ways to stop trees. that's right, life in your neighborhood is over. this means you, as a homeowner, don't have to constantly hunt for alternatives to grow trees wherever it happens, so for each new tree planted, you'll get all the varieties you're looking for. as i said, try to brush up on a new, new landscaping and design to trim down trees if you can. third, keep outside. outside, with so many permaculture projects and greenfield projects on the agenda, most people can't imagine losing their forest shrubs, which are often larger than human lifespan and get many larger steps. so actually getting rid of trees is better than losing too many. there are a number of ways in which removing trees is more environmentally friendly than burning them or logging by plants you don't like. most are equally rewarding: removing silt and snowmelt in your backyard and soaking up as much snow as possible as long as possible. putting soil to the ground and water to the soil, instead of just planting the soil, is a good thing that many companies already do. with trees, you avoid having to worry about what the future will hold, or about encountering one more tree after you leave. but the longer that trees still come out of the ground, the harder it will be to get them out. with a fire, the tree has nowhere to go. then i like to use some as an example. and as one of my great squirrel friends taught me, burning the snowmelt not only makes the tree more threatening, but even lands a leg above the tree without the hole. for the hound, however, forest shrubs attract a particularly good environmental threat. the fragmentation of spring-sized chunks of wood and stream nutrients, perchlorate-anxious soil, sediment encroachment, and air pollution is among the things that kill houndbees. on the other hand, the best short-lived conservation species can be put to good use. kathy mckinnon is the assistant professor of zoology at the university of arizona. she teaches a series of photography classes in arizona and seattle, washington.",grover

626,"Climate change: How rich people could help save the planet unfortunately, we are paying double the nominal tax rate to cover climate change. some rich, including many in our own fossil fuel industry, can indeed pay more than others. this increases the life cycle of fossil fuels and diminishes the amount of carbon that can be avoided or reduced. meanwhile, almost all large-scale sources of greenhouse gases like oil, coal, and natural gas can be eliminated in rapid decline. related: climate change war intensifies – and still hitting harder, faster during a presentation this week on the matter, the boston institute for advanced study's nathan a. muckenfuss said that such reductions could result in a reduction in the world's forests of 82.9 billion acres by 2030. that sounds like a lot. but that's like saying it would affect all of humanity by 2050. because it would mean a total loss of over 11 billion acres. now if you're a 95-year-old computer geek, you're wondering, ""is this the most distressing threat to our planet?"" like life on earth today, this threat is all about seeing a bigger planet. this might not sound like you want to listen to as much as you can but it is serious. and it's true. if the continued dominance of fossil fuels is keeping us from seeing that larger, wider universe where we live, we will be living dangerously. because it is happening, if the situation is reversed, mankind will emit 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide and endanger nearly 7 billion people's planet. so we will die the planet before the long term impact hits. if things keep getting worse, you might see a few deaths from here and there. the culprit will be climate change. when you make a deal to become more responsible about climate change, think of previous false prophets and disaster scenarios like the u.s. and canada putting in action to slow the emissions of toxic gases and prevent another catastrophic climate event like the one in 1950. we live in an era of extreme weather events, extreme poverty, extreme environmental degradation, and catastrophic human health impacts. and we all know that if we weren't paying more for carbon-free energy, there would be less need for fossil fuels for energy, taxes, and financing. advertisement and since the role of fossil fuels and solar energy is not sustainable, the danger is that the remaining fossil fuel fields may get sidelined by political, economic, military, and military leaders in washington, d.c. and elsewhere. climate scientists warn that if carbon prices continue to rise at the current rates, it could be well before we get comfortable with carbon emissions growth. while this is uncertain, our decisions on how to prevent climate change will almost certainly be dictated by what's best for the environment and our economy. related: how the world's blackest city could spark a revolt and we will need a humanitarian community, part of an ever expanding transnational cohort, that fosters a level of understanding and will come to see this game in all its forms. the world wildlife fund recently concluded that the development of these groups could save 29 billion tons of co2 – and trillions of dollars. this includes millions of people, which would save more than $1 trillion annually and lead to a reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions globally. our environmental agenda could also change in the process, by getting governments to better understand how to tackle climate change more effectively, collectively and collectively. the global effort for action toward climate change that has taken place has yielded results. climate denialism and global politics are being weakened and replaced by the ideology of ""conscience vs. rationality."" all of this is happening not just in rich countries but in large, developed markets. it's true that the u.s. military is not the world's only customer, but there are some smaller and smaller economies which can provide the technological and commercial support needed to mobilize coal, oil, and natural gas. governments in both europe and the u.s. need to have their own coal and oil fields to support them. these would enable an advanced corporate-owned model that will lessen, block, and ultimately kill the fossil fuel industry.",grover

""i'm willing to be a dictator and have made the abolition of the human trafficking, which led to the criminalization of child labor,"" moore told cnn's dana bash. ""i have 10 years of experience working with these types of organizations. this is what we must do."" she said the united states doesn't fully understand north korea's problems, including the growing economy, the shocking death toll and oppression. but moore is the first person to see that its leadership is willing to face those issues. ""when these social issues come up, sometimes there are dictatorships, there's been that talk of militarization of the korean peninsula, they're just not that clear,"" she said. ""that makes it challenging to us."" north korea's government is also intent on keeping its leaders away from friends and relatives of kim jong un, her father, the powerful leader. according to moore, the new leader has taken a real interest in kim jong un, who is believed to have had ""significant and extensive"" involvement in promoting women's rights within north korea. moore believes north korea's leaders have noticed that the young and established women's movement may not be immune from facing life threats in the future.

""to our eager little parishioners, let me say this before everyone is underwhelmed by this event: yes, we have experienced the pains of the unknown... and, yes, i am also praying to god to protect you both because most of you feel it is time to reach for strength in prayer and ease the already-scheduled duties and responsibilities that lie ahead..."" reads a brief statement posted to a home website. i am praying for these extraordinary people, that they feel peace and calm as they come together as a community at christmastime... the gift of each, above all, truthfulness and understanding... and, i join in the prayer that may have meaning in the time of this time of danger. it will be your contribution towards our healing and eternal peace. on top of all that, there are tens of thousands of jews doing bifurcated baptisms to meet the end of the world. the names of many of these children are as varied as the names of many living british catholics — as well as some atheists, christians and jews — and as they are related. but what is the key: how do you protect the churches of all faiths and all faiths against the rise of the far right? 1. be sensitive the notion that most jews are anti-semitic or anti-immigrant was raised about 80 years ago but the practice has been embraced by most jewish believers in the united states of america for at least as long as it has existed. as i wrote in my book judaism of my mother's son: the temple of sixty b'nai jesuits, sixty b'nai jesuits did everything possible to protect the tenets of judaism and in some cases, therefore the future of jewish life. i think of them on behalf of the entire jewish community. they're standing there in the jewish realm, protecting us all as we stand, taking us seriously and ready to answer the call of our faith in jesus christ, and at the same time fighting against an evil in all its manifestations. 2. be sensitive to the content the focus on jews and jewry today has fallen on the majority. according to s.j. estimates, the population is about 36 million. they are among the largest european-american jewish communities. many are more devout than muslims or christians and more religious than jews, although they have tended to vary in their observance. i find it troubling that in the wake of the events of the past few years, it would be inappropriate to use the phenomenon of jews and jews being out in the open for attention and ""targeting"" as if it were some sort of target practice. rather, i find it troubling that such attack would be directed at jews as a vital national constituency in the u.s. and against whom it seems credible to target israeli jews, many of whom would call the ""israeli""s"" jerusalem the ""zionist"" of choice, or even ethnically arab israelis. i would like to see an effort to stop these attacks on israelis. this may be my opinion in response to president trump's attacks on israeli settlements, continued missile strikes on syria's chemical weapons sites, and denial of assurances by its prime minister that negotiations are serious and feasible. i hope that more people across the world, especially the israeli public, would join this movement. and, surely, more of these palestinians will join. 3. respect the status quo one of the great prophecies of judaism is the outcome of the people of israel turning against the oppressors, who had promised to rule over them as long as these oppressors remained in power, and what the israel government had become over these people. i believe the overwhelming majority of jews are in full compliance with this belief. now it would be appropriate and reasonable to consider how do we best to protect them – a certain level of tolerance will be the greatest for judaism in many parts of the world, but also in many other parts of the world. i encourage those who want to talk to me on this and have more detailed information on each area of judaism in the united states, and elsewhere. because i want to offer counsel not just to those who care but also to those who have spoken. these are true beliefs and ideas and",grover

633,"The tourism legacy of the Olympic Games lahore: the olympic games are incredible. they also represent one of pakistan's most crucial cultural moments, leaving a deep imprint on the nation. in 1964, the first winter olympics opened in beijing – where athletes and officials spent an exhilarating hour on the black-and-blue red pitch – and held for 17 months, with the 1932 olympics ending in brazil. when world war ii broke out in japan and poland in 1945, the united states was thrust into a war that was not due to be fought, but rather focused on the cultural and educational landscape of its own south american colony. during this period, the two countries relied heavily on the lunar new year (uninth) holiday, and the lunar new year celebrations, often managed to confine themselves to san francisco as it happened in shanghai and paris. the three-day long uninth festival, especially during the winter months, brought the country together. all of this with the help of china, where the lunar new year clock is calculated after the event is run and forgotten. according to an official, uninth did not reach every household in pakistan in 1964 because that would have banned the holiday. the actual results, in an opinion piece in the pakistani newspaper wazir, are questionable. wazir's opinion piece stated that the chinese regime did not have the constitutional right to approve holidays and celebrations that were planned and executed by the un in 1964, for fear of upsetting the sensibilities of its neighbours. pakistan's constitution, according to wazir, stipulates, ""public holidays cannot be granted without reason, and some restrictions are unnecessary..."" much of the uninth is purely coincidental, according to wazir. the un was founded in 1934 when nawaz sharif joined pakistan on a visit to the us. in 1979 he held a cabinet meeting.

637,"How this outbreak is adding to the risk of miscalculation between global enemies by alexander ramsey april 5, 2015 the 23rd general authority of the united nations has begun launching a global plan to combat miscalculation. the plan was designed to open up possibilities within the intergovernmental organizations and within their internal mechanisms, such as bilateral, multilateral agreements that undermine peacekeeping efforts in or outside the region. the plan will develop special measures to counteract internal miscalculations in the security council. experts believe that the plan could slow down the rising threat of internal miscalculation. a widely respected u.n. expert, david addington, has said that central stability and continuity of an american presidency could be tested at any time. addington is set to appear on the unt directorate panel as a member of the un legal committee (the un criminal code). members of the presidential advisory council on foreign relations, the u.s. state department's strategic counsel, and others discuss the role of the security council in any crisis in any context. this brings us to the alarming dynamics within this crisis. to protect an organ against internal miscalculation, we must defeat external miscalculations. although external miscalculations occur frequently, it is mainly in developed countries that tend to avoid taking the extra step of looking at the public balance in understanding internal miscalculations and an ad hoc policy toward this trend. the panel itself has a very rigid role, however, as the governments we are supposed to represent are judged on their value. they regard outsiders with special protection, often in the form of role models, to avoid the internal incidents that could cast the region and its oversight mechanisms as a complete failure. the internal miscalculation within the security council is neither the end of instability in the middle east nor the beginning of a new crisis. resurgence of destabilization in the world's major industrial economies is possible. china is likely to be the major influence in causing the problems of the region, and iran, likely to continue its influence in the world economy, is likely to be the main influence in achieving this, either by facilitating new alliances or funding them. we must limit the use of external miscalculations, have more bilateral and multilateral discussions and building more institutional units outside the security council to investigate internal miscalculations, to prevent and limit external miscalculations from exacerbating. finally, global organizations should engage in direct dialogue with their respective leaderships, providing them with the tools they need to address external miscalculations, and to equip them with sufficient legal structures to protect from internal miscalculations by responding appropriately to the perceived role they may be responsible for. they must resolve the internal miscalculations if some kind of systemic response is required. diplomats whose involvement in internal structures has been an issue in the past, however, should take firm action. david addington, who is regarded as a master of hybrid diplomacy, is well established in both international and domestic diplomacy. he was the u.s. ambassador to the council from 2006-2014. (see for an in depth look at the president's position on the syria crisis, syria and mideast.) he has lectured on international law at more than a dozen foreign and domestic universities. addington has been deeply involved in a broad range of relationships within global organizations, including the development and humanitarian policy council, the intergovernmental council on international human rights, and the future of missionational missions. his advice on unt matters include strengthening and upgrading existing mechanisms to address internal security. addington is a well-regarded and accomplished person and a strong advocate for human rights. my colleagues on these issues had better hope that new zealand is not a global leader in this area, when it comes to international efforts to constrain external miscalculations by solving internal miscalculations. such efforts could curtail the warming of conflict zones, enhance u.s. posture in their midst, and help to create a safe climate for peacekeeping forces in other region. t. simon bolivar is the assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency aid at the united nations. former president barack obama once served under one of his presidential first-term appointees: jerry kostelnik, now at the world food program. although not an occasional foreign correspondent, bolivar is also fluent in latin american and african languages.",grover
638,"Photos: The coronavirus is leaving empty spaces everywhere (cnn) — a coronavirus, from a rare sexually transmitted infection called rompscales that are no more contagious than stds, now appears to be among the most severe. scientists hope the source of the disease can be traced to an underground brothel, a u.s. government scientist told cnn affiliate wsoc. on monday, it was confirmed by the centers for disease control and prevention that rompscales, which can carry amoebic hypoxia, have infected 24 in 22 states, the cdc reported monday. more than 30 others have died. that could mean the virus may have missed its usual path, or it could have started infecting people the the virus has not yet previously touched, according to a study published last month in the journal emerging infectious diseases. ""the combination of infection with amoebic hypoxia — the loss of cellular activity that drains bodily fluids — and the virus's passive presence is suggestive of a possible carrier,"" dr. luis adrian, a virologist and virologist at emory university, said in a statement. the highly contagious illness occurs when the body's immune system clatters down into a maelstrom of viruses and bacteria capable of infecting and killing a person. the most common causes of the virus are transmission of blood-borne thrombocytopenia, the body's enzyme that stops the clumps from forming normally. ""this is what started this disease, and we suspect that it started infecting people in different ways,"" dr. keith skinner, the cdc's lead scientist on rompscales, told cnn's eric kyllo. an infected person is completely ""completely unresponsive, but can be given medication that increases the body's overall immunity,"" skinner said. the official cause of the deadly rompscales is unknown. much of the chlamydia virus that started in 2010 was thought to be behind rompscales' discovery, but it's now been linked to cancer, bone marrow disease and other infections, according to the cdc. individuals who have a cousin in the u.s. or canada may also be at high risk for the virus, skinner said. the american red cross sent a well-child and pregnant woman from florida to atlanta to check on her baby. although rompscales are not officially named, american red cross spokesman scott marshall told cnn affiliate wbzz-tv that the infection is ""explosive"".

639,"The week in 38 photos the fed just announced new policy changes, and that doesn't mean the economy is back in growth mode. even more striking is the warning the fed is putting out in the just-released minutes of its march meeting, which said ""the economy is increasingly encouraged by the moderation in labor growth and the increasing use of automation."" this probably reflects the fact that some of the fed's increased optimism is mainly a result of uncertainties in the labor market, but also the fact that the various earnings reports are balanced. even worse, because the fed has launched a $4.3 trillion asset purchase program and consumer debt now at $4.4 trillion, that program will have negative impacts on the economy. it also impacts the incomes of households (but not the wages of employees) and causes the labor force participation rate (which was around 62.1% in january), which has jumped to 62.3% in february (over all those who worked in january and february). that being said, the fed's meetings lately are a little more important. inflation has been a bit fickle during this downturn, and that also comes from an economy that has weakened for so long that employers feel like they need more workers. in addition, the timing of the various new monthly fed programs has been very unpredictable. sometimes they will be beneficial, sometimes they are just unnerving. so even with these twin maneuvers, the fed has been a little more patient since the beginning of 2018. it needs to repeat how it reacted at the start of the year. it may sound strange to note it now, but since the beginning of 2018 the fed has sold off tons of dollars. the fed sold $9.3 trillion of treasury securities in the first week of january and then $7.7 trillion during the first two weeks of march, in the millions of dollars. in the first six months of 2018, the fed sold $37.3 trillion, while the fed sold $37.4 trillion in mortgage securities. in addition, the fed has been buying $3.2 trillion worth of treasury securities since july of 2017. the bernanke funds, according to the latest economic bill plus statement (paid to the washington post), were worth about $200 billion in march, much of which was used for the fed's open-ended operation twist. the fed has said it is ending its program in principle, but they've adjusted that up. so far, the policy has been effective in controlling costs and eliminating uncertainty from the market, but they've also taken immediate steps to boost inflation. the bigger concern is that next week, the treasury department will release the first set of interest rate hikes since the third quarter of 2013, or soon afterward. that's not likely to change the policy stance of the fed, but there are some concerns that could be a cause for concern. if the fed's policy discussion has been sufficient to prevent some pain, then there could be a bit of a jump in the unemployment rate. the fed seems more concerned about the possibility of a recession when it released the minutes of the minutes of the march meeting. the likely result from the fed's recent statement could be the beginning of a slowdown in growth. this is especially so for big retailers, which are the leading members of the economy this year. companies like retailers like macy's and kohl's, aren't strong enough for fed policy to be changed. like all observers, i'm also looking ahead to next year's work being done. so despite all the snags, keep an eye on consumer reports, due out in august. this is one of the first articles i've seen since i got fed up with the economy and turned to them for advice on how to fix it. so stay with me.",grover

""who is the shadowy figure telling the stories of the operatives the police and judges are scouring for?"" asks frank piquet, of the liberal party, who regularly relies on contacts from the media and has helped the security forces identify small groups of charged suspects. that's what senior lawyer amos mavalomo believes has helped create an increasingly menacing picture of the ultra-conservative valls family. shortly after losing his leadership as finance minister in 2014, valls ran a family-friendly bank called valleur. his wife, isabelle, was appointed on a couple of occasions to the public protection commission (pgc), a job given to politicians and politicians in other positions of power. the prosecution alleges that at least some of valls' associates, prosecutors say, used intermediaries to arrange anonymous accounts in france and those of owners of more than 100 international conglomerates. ""the twisted, twisted truth has been made public,"" poulais said last week. mavalomo says most of the plots involved a kind of agent of influence, a person who paid money for something by other means or paid money with government property. he said such people are so exercised with the prestige of having a common clientele that they can now profit by taking advantage of publicity, which can have devastating consequences. he says that, at least, isn't the case. as in other cases, valls' clients can be kept under surveillance as long as they don't leak their identities or do anything untoward. but some details on the valls family's murky business ventures have been deeply muddled, without any official documentation or proof. in one instance, a company that handles transactions to insurance companies helped in the arrest of a german communications expert charged with helping qatari businessmen obtain top ratings on emirates airlines. mavalomo says such leaks are not illegal, but ""they have many cracks in the concrete.""",grover

""our dominant cause of coronavirus infection was transmission of the abnormal precursor bacterium norovirus that is doing havoc on the virus,"" she said. ""by the time we saw this infection spreading so far, we had acquired the world's first person first case. our second victim is now returning to the host, only to be exposed to the virus at the same time as the main cause. an infectious virus that destroys cells, transmits and spreads viruses, spreads very quickly. this is because the virus is spread by a single, broad-organism cell, not a single strand of cells."" in that case, the coronavirus has traveled over the border and isolated enough cells that adults survive for just a few days, then wander off, attacking the rest of the world and killing millions worldwide. ""the wind blows the virus at the will of the immune system,"" she said. ""the disruption that the virus has caused as it does not infect you or your immune system is very severe. the virus then spreads rapidly to other parts of the body. the body and its immune system loses many immune cells and antibodies -- or good defenses -- that protect its body. this leads to the virus being able to destroy the body and diminish its ability to fight off infection."" her findings are published in new england journal of medicine. here's what the experts are focusing on: tracking the virus once it's at a root to start with protecting against the disease early protecting the body from infection early and keep any form of infection as a matter of course if a person has it at any stage in their life and has a clear reason for it avoidant, resistant, and resistramiral infections: here's what the experts are focused on, on the type of infection: a main probable cause of the virus the virus is spread by local transmission of virus or other aerosol particles from infected people or pets these aerosol particles, which are usually aerosolized, include aerosols from one end to the other with resistance, and vapor from another end that may include viruses like bacillus anthracis or merkel's virus. barring these and other potential results, coronavirus infection won't spread very far. however, it could take a few days or more. the virus can be transmitted as short-term as a few milliliters of it. if the virus were spread by close relatives, like the human flu and avian flu (and those associated with both strains), it would be at this stage of the development. it is impossible to predict when people will see disease and have an undetected or extreme reaction. confirmation of symptoms such as fever and cough could appear between five to seven days after an unusual symptom was diagnosed. ""hiv has, again, been very damaging to human population in the past,"" dr. goyette said.

659,"Doctor: How to reduce your vulnerability to coronavirus -- when sleeping dear doctor, last month, i had the eye contact that i have never had before. i was so rested, you always know which areas i want to focus on for improved sleep. after a few days, you tell me i don't sleep in that way; that you wake at 3 in the morning and then get up, then i wake up at 8 in the morning. you say you want to sleep in that way, but in reality, i've never slept in that way with any of you. many years ago, i fell asleep in bed and there was no perceptible feeling going on. it was time to open the book on how to sleep in winter. some scientific study found that women who sleep in ""dark"" airways lack benefits from an antioxidant, anti-microbial immunity, and anxiety, but their sleep cycles get disrupted and rebound. those women reported a morning of negativity and habitual snoring. some studies have indicated the opposite. i think she loves you just fine, but i have started to make trouble because the anticipation builds up in the belly, away from your friends and family. on nights when i'm awake and asleep, it gets more intense and overburdens me, and now, sometimes, i get very angry and defensive. i learn to hug you and tell you we have become a little too good at messing with our senses. i now sleep in that airway sitting on the side of your butt, a few inches shorter than before. sometimes, it's my body that stops working, so i go to bed expecting to enjoy another evening. my problem at this stage in my life is that i'm not an ideal, non-surgical person, and probably never will be. now, i have already started working with my husband and children in advanced engineering in the form of my second career, not for the same reason as you, but for a long time. a normal person would be fine with sleeping in airways, but when your husband and kids wake up during the night, they have to go to bed? my wife is a fine actress, but did you guys really take care of your eyes, when your eyes are closed every morning, and when your cheeks are spotless, deep? do you want to sneak a whiff of your possible sins in your eyes every day, for the rest of your life? well, not to do that is a pretty big bad bet, especially if you're looking for a more relaxed, family-oriented sleep. i have suggested dieting to help with your weight loss, and though you're fine, you have not gotten over your body issues and it's not that easy. cutting out caffeine — as diet pills do — can help, as are other choices, and as they are relatively affordable. but you've talked all the time of knowing, ""i want to lose weight,"" and ""all your tools and weight loss"" can do the trick, right? i know it sounds dumb, but i do find that your neck, not your shoulders, are your biggest weaknesses, so it's really pretty hard for me to pull that off, too. i also suggested reducing your natural fats like olive oil and niacin, and making a meal made with organic ingredients, such as chicken liver, mushrooms, and grilled vegetables, which are low in saturated fat. i also ask my wife to make a small bowl of cereal every once in a while. i don't think she will do this! please, better sleep and find ways to sleep better. i know from the studies we do, that many doctors can tell you about fall-related sleep disorders, but i feel your question is rhetorical. i know there are many ways to help — and there are good ones too. thanks for your prayers, dr. kentashita",grover

662,"A prison pandemic? Steps to avoid the worst when i first came back home in late march, i read several books about the death of a society that tried to become the world's last with the shrillness of a captive human population. it seemed accurate to me. at first, i chafed at reading about the make-believe horror that lay in the streets of a state that hands over so much responsibility for the dead to the authorities. why did the government find itself taking on the needs of people who had all made mistakes or failed, hurting them in various ways, with the lack of moral reasoning, from moving the heads of the state (where they looked like prisoners) to imprisoning the beheaded captives? obviously, we didn't get what we wanted. but let me make one salient point. we failed our country by being so preoccupied with the problem that we didn't care enough to fail (and the citizens of our u.s. might well think so) to solve it. one of the reasons behind the failure to make some sort of radical change in this country was because, well, human instinct did not make up for so many of our failures. we failed to have our disagreements, not to spark our own internal conflicts, not to dwell on the small things (the things of life), not to debate the details (the things of economics, and the things of society). no longer, we put people in cages because of what they did. but we placed a lot of people out of work, and we made decisions on lives, not their lives. the people we imprison are emotionally draining, but they are usually saved – they have nothing to worry about. they're taken, freed and sent home. the fearlessness of they are fine, albeit tiny, save them from being dispatched to the world health organization and the law enforcement agencies. and so we avert some pretty awful problems: we say we just can't handle all of them. somehow, the government got in over our heads – in fact, we gave up on all of them, even the most minor ones, because we didn't have the power to protect them. but we do have the power. and the resources. the existence of large national parks and a powerful pension system contribute nicely to the idea of national leadership, because we value those lost people who died in these jungles, at the hands of tiny creatures like snakes. but we're also making the world less safe, by keeping terrorism (and increasingly, urbanization) on our soil. we can't let people get access to communications if they have no choice but to hide information from law enforcement. and once again, our government is asking us to pay a price for our failure to condemn terrorism. just imagine what it would be like to know, under a prevailing economic market, that all of the government's work, even if it's entirely by my own mistake, will be in vain in some way for our national interests. i don't think we should be asking our citizens to die for the country that always seems ripe for a multi-national fundraising drive for the murder of the father of their children. and i don't think we should be trying to become richer by letting the world rot forever for so many reasons. who knows if there are other things that are more important than having to beat the market?",grover

""he believes it is necessary to bring his country into a state that is a unified and flexible, not a dictatorship,"" said nomaan merchant, spokesman for the palestinian factions fatah and hamas.

That's the challenge we face b.i.g. i quit working for my husband because he hated working women. all he wanted to do was work and get a good job. without coming to terms with it, he didn't realize we both worked for peanuts. he said he would work where he could make it pay. no one was ever paid less than he did. no one was ever employed less than he did. no one was fired less than he did. neither of us had a big career other than doing wrestling and movies. no one can tell if we wanted the same fate for us. no one can say we couldn't do the same. neither of us could. we had two kids. one of them was diagnosed with a cancer. we started counseling each other. when that baby needed some insurance, one of us said she was better than my husband. in colorado springs, colorado we broke up. the baby left the home with his grandparents. before we made another public statement about him, he moved to florida, which, because of the 50% latino vote, would affect every family, including our own. he kept us afloat until she got the insurance. then he left the baby with the grandparents. so you should have been appalled by the investigation (which is especially painful, from a male perspective, given our demographic composition). for example, one would assume that we have 100% white momma-and-baby girls. they have had things happen before. other women never had everything happen before. everyone has different options. it should also be considered before you register to vote for us. we need to be cautious about taking on advertising campaigns not based on gender, so there are a lot of votes that could affect us. but those are the main starting points. first is voting rights. or citizenship. first. the simple truth is that people are not good at voting. there are still millions of people who live in segregation. to lead the way, you have to have proof of citizenship, and identification, id, or passports and possible citizenship. it is more problematic if you're latino. if i make my landlord tell me that i am white and i'm in the closet i'm probably going to look horrible. what is the point of voting if everyone is black, brown, white, or hispanic? second. voting rights. early voting. voters could be deported. voting rights should not be broken up by the few thousand people who somehow hold down jobs and homes. the issues that have been shown to be out of control include race-based discrimination, pressure from ruling class power elites, corporate power culture, and poverty and addiction. in fact, 85% of latinos who are illegally married into the u.s. have no legal right to vote, according to the demos study. those statistics should convince you of the need for change. no, we did not see this study, and we believe that we are dealing with a broken system, not a mania for change. now we hear from highly vulnerable minorities. if we're not careful, the majority of families who have been impacted by such violence will likely be the ones with the most needs. we can't stop them. we can't make these new families vulnerable, but we can make some changes that make them better. when you're inside a household, you feel a sense of connectedness. you want to feel connected with people and you want to move in with them. when you get the opportunities, you move up in life. but you're changing relationships all over the place. a party is a lifestyle. you can't kill yourself before you get married. you're aging and this situation isn't the prettiest place to be. you shouldn't be. the people at fault aren't voters. they're wives, mothers, and wives of brothers and sisters. racism is a disease, a truth. if you're married, you should have a child as an adult. no one is exempt from racism. but we don't want to raise children alone. we all contribute to the community. it's time for change in our government.",grover
666,"Opinion: The real thing holding Africa's female entrepreneurs back to any female entrepreneur seeking a career change, there are several key essential building blocks to success: you have to have a diverse background, you have your skills, you have the money to invest and you have the energy to do it all. that would be a prerequisite for anyone of any age to be here. one of the barriers for women entrepreneurs is the level of discrimination and harassment that impact all gender stereotypes. quite often these stereotypes go into ""them,"" or ""us"" as that is often an official stereotype. many women simply don't know what they are actually talking about. and this imposter is expected to cling back onto the ""them"" stereotypes. if nothing else, it takes some courage to pull back and try to get the conversation moving in a place where entrepreneurs don't get what they are trying to achieve. but how has this impacted entrepreneurship in africa? according to a 2017 world bank survey of women around the world (that was conducted by the state-run global expert report center at the international centre for women and girls) women were the three times as likely as men to take ownership of businesses. in fact, four-fifths of african girls were of the view that ""worldwide, women are less successful."" even the lack of economic opportunities and empowering equity rules around gender equality has changed this stance. a 2015 study by the international partnership for women and girls at the university of rochester also shows that more women are taking ownership of businesses in nigeria than at any other time in the world over the past 20 years. still, women make up a small fraction of all fortune 500 companies, leaving a lot of room for success in any country, but there is clear evidence that africa can lead by example in this regard. the same is true in neighbouring kenya, where women are more than twice as likely as men to own businesses and grow them by at least 50% by 2020. girls and women more often than men are now doing business at a moment's notice, yet leaders tend to focus more on supporting girls in private sector enterprises. so just as gender differences have a huge impact on leadership among business leaders, so have their contribution to the success of children and youth. incredibly, despite the wide range of challenges, africa has the highest concentration of female entrepreneurs. for example, only nine percent of african women say they are more likely to become ""connected and successful"" than those who are less connected, at 41% and 57%, respectively. by contrast, more than 60% of african women say their ""self-dealing"" will be a significant factor in wealth creation for them over time. these women are encouraged to talk about this on their social media profiles; women have two senior roles, both on twitter - an aide (in part) and a consultant; and they work in strategic sectors, including pharmaceutical, mobile and technology. just as importantly, women are more inclined to use social media to publicly support or promote their children, or to ask questions about what goes on in their relationships with their partners or the surrounding community. there are opportunities for female entrepreneurs in america, and they are mostly the ones who are fastest growing ones, almost all of them in those national wealth chains. these women need every chance they can get to shape the future of small business and our continent and achieve a more inclusive society, but if we spend too much time focusing on economic disparities and discrimination and rarely grasp the commonalities that results from it, we risk stifling women's entrepreneurial dreams. to get even more women into management, we need to invest more in research and coaching to ensure that we get more girls to work in senior management positions, as well as pay better compensation. these are all important areas to look for, but money talks. you have to be willing to roll your sleeves up and bite your nails. if you are going to take on the entrepreneurial challenges that everyone else is looking for, there are better ways to do it. but there is no reason we can't do it.",grover

'democrat army' ready to back either candidate groups such as the national campaign for hillary clinton have been pushing for something other than the democrats' preferred positions. instead, they have been pushing the strong passions the gop field often incudes by highlighting bad information, such as the possibility that someone is running for president in a left-wing country. ""rather than focusing on policies that go against our interests, it's time to actually turn our attention to policies that can help strengthen the u.s. economy and middle class,"" said clinton's campaign manager, robby mook. tuesday's debate between clinton and sanders centers on the annual pitch-and-catch nature of television time. saying a message of hope will go a long way toward assuring voters that the country will actually be successful in 2024 when president obama leaves office. sanders was showing little enthusiasm for that idea. ""i think people are focusing on issues that are just short of how the world is supposed to be -- immigration, infrastructure, healthcare, taxes and america's place in the world,"" he said during the debate.",grover
676,"What we're missing about age and the presidency the world has come a long way, a comeback from the rusting pantheon of insignificance that seemed to fail more often than any other world apart from the great depression. it's a story about the return of americans who think, less than six months ago, that even americans who thought they could both be mighty simpletons had a serious drug problem. or at least that's how it started. it's about the damage done to that ""everything else"" routine by the republicans' tax-cut plan, which, without mentioning the more salient buzz surrounding the gobs of drama in this case, drew the broadest yawns of the century and a quarter-million words and an 800-pound beach ball of media scrutiny. and if you've got a question that readers can't bear to answer without at least one extra wrinkle, it is a question that presages a presidential election. what if the nation is now as global a place as the united states, or the latest to join the amazon forest of humankind, or the american college-age population of spangly-hipped teenage playboys in environs that mark twain rewrote from fake or offbeat love stories? it's all quite profound. maybe in general, we're feeling the proverbial cry from sadness. maybe it's what they call a woe is me feeling? who are these groupings, i don't know. perhaps they're shouting about the powers-that-be in an emergency somehow tamped down, and ours, with its increasing ideological acumen, have a legitimate authority to carry it out. maybe the parliamentarianry in washington is just as indulgent. just what they're, you might say, are those things that we'll find out by getting busy, running or having any such thing happen, but it's a subject nobody wants to talk about or get carried away with. it's possible that middle- and high-schoolers from that working-class-low-income generation -- self-described roman catholics, protestants, ahistorians, swank bloggers -- will answer that question together. but they'll miss every single one. we'll still think that presidential candidates and other matters will never attend an afternoon bible study together and remark on the standards of the flow of justice of our very system, or of the long, and never-to-be-repeated, truth of the bible. and if that does happen, they'll be asking, ''what would jesus do? you might pause and wonder what joseph smith accomplished during the last 17 months of his life. he created a brand of civilization that was, in fact, run by the apolitical people of all faith and all races. it's not like there's another methodist in history, a revolutionary teacher, a family patriarch, a half-naked coal miner, a democratic head of state. so, according to the new testament, that sacred law -- the law of we we, as paul used to say in 9) timothy, and the law of mind, and the law of peace -- exists because a kind of bureaucracy exists that is somehow more heavily regulated by the press and executive agencies than by a church or a religious group. it is, if you'll forgive a fraction of the shouting and spitting from members of both parties, actually pretty ancient, and it all traces back to the arrival of our civil right to religious speech. and the law is what the latter set in motion when it came up for the legislative and presidential nominations in 2004. when you hear john milton speak with a brooding tone, it might seem as if he was sipping a bottle of wine or coals en route to a senatorial appointment. but milton was right when he said that all political activity that takes place under this law would be meaningless without this law. but here's something else that he didn't say: there are currently many, many other things that don't require a strong political act. and this is, apparently, what we've got. and we're not really talking about the stuff you say the next time you like to claim to know, ""that's me."" for there are many things on which people take the media and the faith in stride. we're talking about these things that we don't really know about. there are many things to which we assume we are not part, and the lies we try to make about them that we just didn't know about. that's what's happening to us, mr. trump. all we need to know is that we're tired of being told what to believe.",grover
677,"Coronavirus shows up Trump's compassion deficit by lauren trott and luiz inacio lula da silva washington, april 5 (cnn) - former president ronald reagan to trump in 2017:we need to learn to be compassionate to people. (crosstalk) former president ronald reagan, who now works to raise awareness of malnourished people, lobbied president trump's presidency for medical research funding when reagan died two years ago. reagan urged the u.s. government to do whatever it could to prevent the spread of the virus that caused his passing. the scientific debate over how to curb vaccine complications is growing more contentious. health officials say they can reduce the number of vaccine-preventable cases, reduce total deaths, increase access to treatment and cure for the disease. but the substance of reagan's critique was shared last year by medical journal the lancet about vaccines. it was published under the title ofpacing healing america: a global summit on vaccine research. that was the conclusion of new research done by the nobel prize-winning team that led that study. reagan concluded: ""a woman who creates her entire life that she gives birth to is like a blade of wood. she is, by definition, a blade cutter. these minutes of physiologic existance and a sentence or two of discipline they receive for practice and not build upon what they have encountered so far. these minutes of enlightenment? the experience of a bariatrician who no longer had much to be ashamed of his success so he could shed the burden of failure, let a patient with obesity cope with the inadequacies of those who need his professional attention to the complexity of their life. ""yes, we can develop vaccines that can reduce the risk of vaccination, but we also can include every human life."" that report documented how most vaccines are ineffective. and that reasoning was followed up by more than 500 recommendations by president trump and the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention as they worked to prevent vaccine complications. alongside his legacy of delivering on his commitments, the president told health and human services secretary tom price that the u.s. needs a plan for stopping the spread of vaccine complications among young people and their families. ""i want children to reach maturity first, not age four,"" he said. reagan also pointed out: ""a disease like polio, an encephalitis vaccine (fiv) is not the cure we need right now, as the vaccine precludes the effective protection of mmr."" ultimately, all americans are to blame for this deadly health threat. and, it is often the administration of the state and federal governments that supports the vaccine response. no one is to blame but individual communities, where different approaches are needed. some will demand assistance. others will say bad things should not come from washington. ""this is not how government works. it will be a lot easier to build the infrastructure around it than it is today,"" said representative frank wolf, a pennsylvania republican, in an interview last year with a group of former reporters at the uso in minnesota. ""it all depends on what the state chooses to do with how these recommendations are framed."" but nothing has happened yet.

678,"Four women were serious candidates for president. What happened? omaha, neb. — they were hillary clinton and john kasich, the two prospective democrats running to succeed president donald trump. yet as a group, they were also poised to defeat an idea that was becoming — and still is — a high priority among those at the table to determine who will be the nominee. the 2024 gop presidential nomination, championed by republican rudy giuliani, has one party and the entire nation. the other party — barack obama and president george w. bush — are on the other side. the notion of a second, third, fourth — taking a less consequential individual out of the election process — has become a little more complicated at times this year, with first-time candidate carly fiorina, conservative talk radio host glenn beck and rookie new jersey gov. chris christie all running the board. so what was this republican group? who did they choose? what was their base? the vast plurality of americans — roughly 60 percent — who had tuned in to see if they could unite, according to a 2016 wall street journal-abc poll conducted shortly after trump's upset win over the democrat, hillary clinton. fiorina says she cannot see the day they'll hand that responsibility to one another. that's because the base cares about establishment politics — ""it feeds into republican bigotry and political cynicism,"" she said, before adding that she's not convinced trump is sincere. the people who had been thought to be leading the party are also democrats, she said, and that's why the party had its ""spot on."" they are to be elected into an elite executive board, she said. and that's why she, christie and obama didn't end up being huge candidates; because they will never be given a run at their first thought, she said. they may well not have reached that point until years later, when the national discourse begins to get a little more assertive. and they'll have to grow up once the nominations are announced, assuming, of course, that the current president, hillary clinton, and republican paul ryan are not contenders for the office at the time. so what exactly has emerged? there's nothing surprising about gop candidates, current and former campaign observers say. and it's debatable whether the real-life successes of trump and clinton represented what's needed for leadership — and what their next steps might be as candidates turn to the type of outsiders they once considered the weak link in their power relations. hobbs, for instance, noted that if he is one of the most popular left-wing politicians on earth, he will probably be no closer to winning confirmation than the candidate who is there today. five other finalists — bloomberg's carly fiorina, former ebay ceo meg whitman, former vermont gov. howard dean of dean university, clemson university president robert woodruff, florida governor jeb bush and rep. jim greer of indiana — have similar profiles. they are expected to gain help in winning interviews with a variety of media outlets this week, before president-elect trump takes office. in 2004, after the election, gerald ford reportedly said that he believed six different candidates were viable for the republican nomination, regardless of how they received the nomination. there has been a torrent of hope for third-party candidates in the wake of the president's shock victory, according to some analysts. for the first time, trump had signaled a willingness to use organized labor to help him with the conservative agenda. in december, the president publicly offered his top team of staffers to raise taxes to pay for infrastructure projects, among other policy proposals. on thursday, john kasich told the new york times that in the short term, he was worried that the primary race might not make sense to motivate more voters with a non-political focus, and more likely to only focus on what trump has said. yet every speaker at an event to encourage working class voters said that the republican ticket would make a difference if the field remained focused on serious issues. perhaps no other candidate more worthy of closer attention has gone beyond the top ranks. ""i'm optimistic that donald trump can grow into the kind of person who is accessible, able to launch fundraising campaigns and political ad buys that are not dependent on party affiliation,"" said gordon smith, who worked for dennis dennis, sr., the son of a real estate developer and went on to work with trump.

679,"I'm chronically ill, and this is what Congress can do to protect me this version of yvonne fletcher's full story is a great cover story by the huffington post, part 7 story, part 2 story, part 3 story, part 4 story and this is maybe my opinion. here is a fact: congress must create a new set of standards and guidelines for assessing research findings and disease response, including the use of new information about the disease rather than analyzing existing sources. this set of standards will let researchers track new information, check medical literature, and set important other standards. in the modern era, the ease with which information is recorded by researchers has created new opportunities to investigate and identify new treatments and treatments for a wide range of diseases. likely sen. dianne feinstein, d-calif., says that this proposal is more ""truthful"" than the current multi-partisan bipartisan effort, because because ""and this is precisely where the congress should be heading."" but in truth, we must keep considering these claims before considering the results. so, what do we do with the secret declarations made by senators representing states across the country to congress? this is what two anonymous senators wrote about this week in a letters to their colleagues and other prominent people in the health industry: – until congress brings these limitations to their own throats, industry-sponsored revisions to existing protections will likely be ignored. – although this is nothing new to either of the two groups (paul & zoll are working on one legislation), that concern is long-standing. many politicians have gone so far as to outright deny the existence of this so-called biological consensus. not only does our penchant for ""truthful"" statements decry the existence of ""false"" concerns, they implicitly admit to their fearmongering about ""research"". nothing is more upsetting to the american medical community than when a doctor's medical career is called into question. to the extent that it is true, major health providers who are trying to make health care accessible and affordable will seek to pass off this concern as factual rather than a political issue. – but that doesn't make it so. and just because these common-sense changes don't directly address scientific consensus, they raise a dangerous issue of legality. moreover, congress would be left with a choice to reconsider the science or reject outright a wide range of ways it uses scientific evidence to investigate the cause of diseases, something none of us in this case is suggesting. to be clear, we are not suggesting that you can ignore the scientific evidence. we urge the health insurance companies to give their employees legal protection from taxpayer-funded insurance fraud —– through mandatory medical savings plans, a careful inspection of claims and rules for reporting health care fraud. so congress would have two choices: ignore these sort of claims, endorse and maintain the myth that scientific evidence is built on pseudoscience or throw out the scientific consensus completely. – but instead of voting with their paymasters, or passively congratulating future senators for doing what is right for the american medical community, business interests and the united states of america should make a case for the obvious: government support for health research, rather than opposing unnecessary research. – to spare the readers of this story the senseless ""reparations"" that this senators helped arrange. because we didn't know what they were talking about, we were mortified that the senators didn't try to write our article. but we'll be writing about it in the coming days.",grover
680,"Bail out the people first, before the companies, in coronavirus crisis by emile park (cnn) — people in africa have symptoms of coronavirus, a type of viral coronavirus that can cause respiratory issues, but the disease remains in the rare t-cell population. so now people can go to the nearest hospital to recover from the virus. some african countries can be struck by the virus. in africa, for example, the african continent has its own kind of virus — the same virus that causes ebola. the problem is that people in these parts do not get the virus, and believe it is something new. on its face, it is actually from a faulty source — in the form of a diseased nucleus. but now the infection has been rebranded and spread to people in places where it doesn't belong. the disease is spreading to people in different regions of asia, north america, latin america and elsewhere. it is now found in parts of africa and asia, including india and the middle east. the person is exposed to dengue, chikungunya, and other diseases that manifest in respiratory conditions, including pneumonia and ""preventable death"" from aids, according to the world health organization. global disease specialists have acknowledged that coronavirus may have spread into the gulf of aden from yemen, where two other cases were found. just this week, the world health organization launched a new international campaign to fight the spread of coronavirus. the theme is ""decoding the symptoms and how to prevent the disease from spreading."" in yemen, it is the number one cause of infection of the victims. ninety percent of the victims died in the outbreak, said youssef seshadri, coordinator of the who's internal health and education department. he said last week that symptoms might differ from where the infection occurs in the virus. also, most people take for their own safety — with the exception of just those who are walking by the doctor's office and order food, he said. there is no worldwide registry for preventable deaths from coronavirus, he said. in the maldives, india, nigeria, senegal, lesotho, lesotho, uyghur, tuba people there in addition to people on strict quarantine. meanwhile, in chirino, california, a virus is circulating but has not reached the bug, said alejandro ortiz, director of its detection and prevention operations. chirino is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air. as the virus spreads through the air, it spreads rapidly among those near a bug, he said. the infected mice can bite through the skin, leaving them exposed to three to 10 minutes of coughing. by the time the infected mice have died, they had picked up two temperature sensors inside their homes that detect heart rate. doctors believe these are mosquitoes that spread the virus. ""we have avoided all that,"" ortiz said. the virus is not found in chimps, but enough, he said, that they are able to prevent contracting it. a claudia cell is still present in 150 communities on the island of santa cruz. the virus is most common in tanzania, but also in parts of gabon, niger, algeria, senegal, sudan, mali, mauritania, niger, mauritania, chad, guinea and mali. in south africa, where the virus is most common, officials are testing a bacterium there to fight it. they are testing people for the virus but expect it to be there in the next few weeks. in brazil, the outbreak has killed 68 people and sickened 587. six of those are brazilians. all those infected and the illness are from locally consumed drinking water. brazil's health ministry called for the quick reversal of the contamination of the water systems. countries with highest transmission rates are usually home-made rivers, and those upstream have abundant drinking water — some with water catchments above a certain elevation. but south africa runs on lime. brazil could become the world's first country to develop well-protected drinking water supplies because it imports 20% of its direct domestic supply from fotoasomung and its rural ewi people. officials in nigeria also know that the epidemic in south africa had only affected the country's inner cities, towns and villages. the main problem is that only 40% of those living in the inner city are remotely affected, ortiz said. there are also delays in shipping many pharmaceuticals and vaccines and vaccines destined for affected countries, just as major manufacturing plants in the world are prioritizing their plans for the worst affected countries.

683,"The Super Tuesday no one predicted a week ago with only two days remaining before the gop primaries, president donald trump and democratic challengers and independent voters were salivating at the prospect of raising money to help their campaign. but it was just the start of the day, as trump accused sanders's democratic opponent of trying to ""turn our country into a socialist country"" and called in his own candidate, wisconsin's paul ryan, to take a shot at him. the latest set of developments wasn't pleasant for the white house, which was in town to help sanders launch his own ticket. at various stages of his effort, obama himself rallied supporters to a rally in pennsylvania, where obama told the crowd his divided country was ""trying to turn our country into socialism."" cnn's maureen dowd reported in an article published monday that obama had claimed that sanders ""can hold a major key to determining what a new country of america can look like."" by that, dowd meant sanders. if the allegation proves to be true, it would be by far the most consequential piece of evidence of the primary season that went wrong this week, cnn's trump claim or any other. as the long weekend nears, these developments are becoming increasingly important for undecided voters, given the critical implications for the winner in a far-off presidential primary. the popular democratic party primary gives the presumptive republican nominee a chance to offer a bold pivot against the republican frontrunner. during the 2012 campaign, romney lost to president obama by 16 percentage points. what could we glean from this situation? this was not a trump candidacy, but a republican contest that had become about as close as the republican race can get, in terms of demographics. in 2012, in the house and senate primaries, the republican contenders appeared to be a coalition of republicans and democrats, a diverse coalition. they were not the kind of coalition of republicans and democrats that would carry the party to a major victory in the midterm elections. at the time, obama and his team wanted to block a bernie sanders-led ticket from being established. and they weren't about to let trump become their nominee. but sanders on tuesday said the election is also being ""the result of a brand war."" ""he said he was going to win in michigan,"" sanders said of trump. ""he said he was going to win in wisconsin,"" sanders said of trump. ""what he said at the time is it's not about whether or not a democrat wins the election,"" sanders said. in all likelihood, trump and his opponents are entirely aligned, at least a little, with the nominee. trump is going to win the republican nomination, the new york times said. and sanders isn't the only one in the race. and the core of that race isn't among republicans. liberal democrats will likely be resistant to sanders, said robert killeen, a law professor at rice university and former executive director of the federation for american immigration reform. ""he's an enormously popular guy, not so much politically aligned with what the democratic party stands for,"" killeen said. ""but sanders is too obviously big for that party."" clinton has never had a campaign like this, to the extent that she has been able to distract voters from her own unpopularity within the party. by suggesting sanders will beat trump in a state with a sizable democratic electorate, clinton himself is saying that somehow she and trump won't work together. sanders could appear that way, if his campaign is a show of fiscal restraint while bending to popular pressure from republicans. trump has spent years trying to shift control of the democratic party away from the republicans. and his own handlers have toned down their style, pulling left and center in a move that has energized centrist democratic voters and the democratic party. those who favor smaller government or greater freedom are predisposed to support clinton, according to the most recent surveys. sanders has repeatedly said that he and trump could form a coalition of alliances to accomplish certain goals. still, the election could yield a unique opportunity to sway the electorate in a more compromising direction.",grover
684,"Black voters know the only thing that matters a study by the nonpartisan pew research center says 34.2% of black voters are black, compared to 31.5% of white voters. that's a remarkable disparity for a state that holds just 23 electoral votes and is averaging around 40 electoral votes over the past century. so where does that lead us? ""it doesn't surprise me. i wouldn't call it surprising, but it certainly gives you a very strong sense of feeling and calling,"" says brokaw, who played basketball with cheney in the 80s. ""you look at pennsylvania and florida for instance and think about voter turnout and everything else... what could possibly go wrong?"" that may seem like a pipe dream, but professor kowalberg doesn't see anything like it coming from middle-of-the-road voters in the gop. ""well, the iowa voting averages out,"" he says. ""maybe a few others... but somewhere around the 26% of white voters say they don't vote. these were pretty common."" whoa, that's a lot of people out there. those numbers (a handful) don't seem all that surprising – why is this a big deal when one group is responsible for the majority of demographic change in a state like iowa, with an average of nearly 65% of its voters reporting no current democrat or republican in the last few years? pew puts it this way: 43.8% of republican voters in iowa went to the polls in 2016, putting them in great position for an eventual statewide contest. then there's gary burtless, the presumptive republican nominee in iowa who beat democrat chuck grassley, 58-39, for the senate in 2014 and added another 1.2 million votes to the caucus. the rest of the country's electorate does the same. the ""other,"" folks just from iowa, that's the other five states that haven't managed to maintain the double-digit gains obama achieved in 2008. he won on the red and blue lines in 2008 by 36 points, but within these five states his margin fell below 20 points – a loss that created significant resentment for republicans. that's actually the case in south carolina, where joni ernst's formidable 8-point lead over rand paul fell away due to new data from a new poll from the conservative conservative southern institute. and the race for governor of massachusetts is in serious jeopardy: although not super-safe, the presumptive republican nominee is far from the worst: polls give him a 2.5% lead, and he trails obama by 8 points. still, there's something to be said for the diversity of opinions in iowa, even if we simply interpret that poll results to indicate a loosening of the racial nature of the population. ""if you want to be clear and satisfying on how you're affecting the electorate, you have to embrace very diverse demographics,"" says brokaw. ""and i think that's one of the things that has been more of a challenge than any other piece of the puzzle."" but he makes good points in his comparison of battleground states. iowa, nevada, new hampshire, south carolina, wisconsin, oregon, and massachusetts all have historical gains of at least 20 electoral votes – a pretty large sum of support for a candidate on any given map. the success of the democrats in states like colorado and north carolina, say, comes down to a much more predictable ability to control demographics, such as demographics in the midwest, south, and appalachia. whether that means that iowa does have the second-fastest growing racial electorate in a major population group, or that some of the country's rural areas – left mostly by professionals – somehow lag behind, brokaw is certain that iowa will win its first major presidential race. ""if you have to deal with a white population in a very rural state like iowa, then that won't be an issue,"" he says. ""in fact, they're pretty young, and all of a sudden they're in control. i think that's a pretty interesting phenomenon, because it appears it's still changing.""",grover
685,"Warren Buffett has the right answer to crony capitalism: women (opinion) if you call the really bottom-10% of people, you're going to catch your breath. a very depressing study (pdf) commissioned by warren buffett, stock manipulation, and other trendy predictions for the future, all takes place against this backdrop. on a simple point, it sounds exactly as bad news. one has to imagine some sort of logic in the audience's reaction to the idea of funding female scientists who are actively on behalf of the government because they want a little piece of why capitalism works. ""put something in the price of a company, and it is highly profitable,"" the article quoted buffett. but more often than not, a company must sell in order to receive a profit. in other words, if women ceos had to work more to their benefit, there would be less competition. that is the premise behind some of the biggest paid media industries today. but as buffett pointed out, just because your ceo pays less than your ""golden cows"" does not mean that her employees are. ""and she really would be more effective with fewer new hires if the company was simultaneously reopening"" an intellectual minefield which the american economy and business talk about. no, those press pundits are just understating the absurd scale of the problem. on the surface, women now make up 90% of the nation's entrepreneurs, and they provide an incredible amount of profits, the typical ceo pays a whopping 15,000 people 1.5 times the average salary of women. the pay gap is predicted to widen more than a trillion dollars by 2040 if women don't find opportunities to partner or invest with their friends. the simple way out of this inequality seems to be to move from an industry as creative and exciting as facebook to an ever-changing class of businesses: education, careers, work, family, and anything else that's at hand. a diverse workforce or a company that offers an unparalleled range of services makes that list impossible to ignore. the vast majority of companies continue to employ people who are married, whose mothers are secretaries or teachers, and have a professional relationship. (women take home about $50,000 less than men, according to a 2016 global survey.) whatever your reasons for wanting business to move forward, make sure your company has women in mind for its future expansion. already they're tackling issues like military academies and the over-reliance on minorities in major fields like manufacturing, transportation, and construction. also, introduce the technology sector to the kind of people who would dare to put money where their mouth is, leading to the arrival of robots, pipelines, broadband networks, and other labor-saving ideas that can fill a decade's worth of jobs. the whole purpose of the dodd-frank financial reform system is to make sure people aren't trapped in the corridors of power. this article was written by my partner at jeffs & sidell, who is an investor in the world of marketplaces and invests in the best value companies.",grover

690,"The popularity of 'Love Is Blind' reveals what we're missing in our lives dear friend: dear friend, i just want to help the gay community. i have to tell you that i live in chicago and ... too many friends all over america think that we are condemned to be captives to far-flung ideas that on one level meet social conventions. well, apparently so. according to the latest edition of american psycho magazine, which just made up a cover story for hbo's upcoming sex horror series that is set to premiere later this year, 'love is blind' is their annual phenomenon. we want to thank god for telling us this. we also want to thank you, the magazine, for revealing what makes the gay community so captivating and endearing to the world. because, this is why, in the aftermath of the sexual harassment scandal that roiled hollywood this spring, the only thing left for the lgbtq community to do was rise up and hit the reset button with its members. the magazine details exactly how they got this treatment and what they did to improve the situation. apparently, charlie huston, legendary writer and producer, began the fight by talking about the subject in no uncertain terms in the first paragraph of the magazine article. among the revelations included huston's use of ""fake,"" ""fake-or-offend,"" ""le"" and ""silent"" pronouns, thereby allowing homosexuality to be referred to and improving the situation. in his inimitable wisdom, writer huston, unafraid to use any form of non-conformist language, suggested that gay men should be openly confronted with the truths of their sexual orientation, including conceiving of a child with someone else. during the article, huston explained why he chose to use the word ""faggot"" with pride. he explains: ""if i've had my day in courts, i know that speech matters a lot for people in their own state of mind. and obviously you can speak of being homosexual, but that doesn't matter because they are destroying you, because they are destroying your future."" huston also argued in response to the responses of various community members, including his own political views, that there were men in the gay community who were looking out for their own homes and were erecting homes to be filled with gay men. quite an effort and largely directed at the entertainment industry, the aids crisis was particularly significant in the context of gay rights. in his piece about the struggles against the aids virus, huston suggested that it was all because hollywood, instead of their 'bunny vibes' promoting issues, was engaged in a glorification of a largely marginalized community on the gay/lesbian/bi/lgbt space. the presence of such a dishonest white, free-wheeling media climate in light of hollywood's insistence to protect its own homo sapiens by challenging the 'bunny vibes' is quite damning. for huston, gay and transgender people - who the gay and lesbian alliance against defamation is protesting as being ""hostile"" to the ""bunny vibes"" - are well aware of the problems and this is why they reacted so ferociously. and therein lies the problem with the gay community. because, the gay community is not surrounded by a white, free-wheeling media environment. huston's article, while detailing the challenges faced by its members, is meant to illustrate the fact that sexual exploitation is not only a problem affecting heterosexuals, it is even affecting gay people. the story also makes clear that the bottom line is that the gay community has been marginalised, neglected and demonised by hollywood which in turn has driven the gay community to take its own destinies. because such divisive language of lust and violation have done nothing to uplift the trans community or women; instead they have been used as scapegoats which unfortunately attempt to manipulate the lgbt community into believing that things are not easy for them. while it is entirely acceptable that gay people can be critically held and embattled by the bgla-operated media which is patronising, this kind of pseudo-pleasure only creates a fantasy space for hostile outsiders who want to protect the ""s***s"" from themselves, or any other group of individuals who has little to lose by resorting to such extreme language. this is a world where homophobia is defined by its perpetuation. and it's precisely this really sad kind of group that is able to justify and subvert its form of intolerance to what it perceives as opportunity. thank god for the success that you have had with 'love is blind'.",grover

""that's where the public health community starts to come in,"" he said. ""you want to get people back on their feet and be at ease. people tend to be in these situations at higher risk because, of course, they can't possibly do any strenuous physical activity to be afraid of it. ""and that's great news, because it gives them time to get back on track with their physical activity."" one of the biggest symptoms that cpk can cause is fever. to prevent it, people first think of it as a fever and those symptoms usually end up being problems such as irritable bowel syndrome, unexplained chest pain, nausea and vomiting. about 75 percent of people with cryptosporidiosis die from it, although don't worry about finding out through names, friends or family. cpk can be carried by people with immune-suppressing bacteria, and in fact, is called porcine enterovirus dorsolateralus, which is what causes the disease, according to doctors without borders. some people with cryptosporidiosis can develop diarrhea and even a strong cough and cough that kill them immediately. the diseases generally begin as early as the middle of march, so they typically last for around the first few weeks of summer. people can get symptoms during the most recent year from a few days prior to their day of work. don't get caught. people who are infected may leave the clinic immediately if there is any significant fever or discomfort in their arms or legs. people infected, usually couples or pre-existing health conditions, may require medical supervision or that they cannot get help. if you have a family member with pid, do not contact your health care provider. pid is a new infection that doesn't have a history of development yet so there is no way for you to tell that you've been infected. it's common for patients with pid to have symptoms which doesn't stop them from having pid symptoms that cause them to have an increased chance of contracting the disease.

""i do think we come to understand that you need to be one of the cautious ones and think, 'can i go through this knowing i have a disease that i can't help?'"" he said. ""how do you prepare yourself before you go to school to make sure you are as vigilant about your health?

696,"How to improve your chances against coronavirus recent research has shown that deadly coronavirus viruses like clostridium difficile and c. difficile can survive more than three years without becoming public health threats. now a us-based computer-aided-diagnosis team, led by former geneticist andrew wakefield, has developed a way to track the flu symptoms of hiv infection. the virus is already in the medical arena and into real life. so how should you approach this tricky management? remember the ""bunny spots?"" many viral strains have been discovered in people's lives in the past. these include clostridium difficile and c. difficile. what happens to virus a viruses and the e virus? (a distinct antigen, which means you don't like what's in your body.) and how do you know the virus a has caught the bug and isn't developing more lethal infections? the virus a is an antigen that has been used in a variety of products, like droppings for homeless dogs, lawnmowers and skiing equipment. clostridium difficile can thrive for about three years, and how long does that stretch? by our estimates, over three years. in their book ""guiding cybersecurity : two ways to assess and protect against clostridium difficile,"" research team leader anil patel, an infectious disease specialist at the mayo clinic in minnesota, offers three key ways to fight the virus: diagnostic is a tool, but it is only a limited tool. it is important to monitor the virus's activity to make sure it's tracking the vaccine efficacy for vaccine candidates. in the next step, patel and his colleagues applied the same search to identifying new genetic codes for protein groups in how the virus types can evolve. ""if we can isolate the protein groups and improve on them, then we can continue to test new strains. we can use this to find gene mutation-lovers. our interpretation of this may also enable us to recreate genetic changes in other groups of viruses in an environment that offers better immunity,"" says patel. early detection helps the team developed the simon1 laboratory device, which aggregates two layers of a virus group measuring a visitor's blood, the germ line, and the threshold for testing the symptoms. the two layers are then scanned by an infrared camera, keeping in view the virus's presence and then counting the ebola virus as it moves between the two layers. it has developed a way to determine precisely the virus within each case, thanks to its camorbatic properties. alarmingly, one of the team's findings was that one of the seven strains whose virus-fighting test had emerged 20 days earlier in the virus lineage, was five times more potent than clostridium difficile. and it's likely much more effective. to prevent illness, the researchers also wanted to collect the viruses using ecg scanning and lung ct scans. this allows them to conduct a pilot study to determine whether each other in the sample will suffer severe allergic reaction if they are exposed to clostridium difficile. the way to beat the virus it's also important to understand why the flu virus is so effective against clostridium difficile. adverse reactions such as the viral diarrhoea and vomiting, often caused by the germ, can kill an even more innocent viral strain of clostridium difficile, ""because clostridium in itself is linked to drug toxicity,"" says patel.

697,"A common-sense approach to coronavirus crisis it's the same battle each year in this time of crisis for hepatitis c, a.p.h. – commonly known as coronavirus or even norvirus – in which scientists face a crisis of the brightest minds. the first known deaths of coronavirus patients began in 2003, and peak cases began in 2008. we now know that this scourge of hepatitis c is a constant concern for the doctors and nurses who care for it. among other researchers, p. moy is currently working on designing a new vaccine (currently the only one available to treat people of hepatitis c, which has infected more than 5 million people globally and infects more than 1.3 million people worldwide). unable to provide a vaccine to replace frontline staff who failed to receive necessary samples, the team is working with stanford university on a new vaccine. in december 2012, ucsf and hackensack university medical center scientists discovered, they have one unique possibility for initiating a vaccine with essential protection against viruses originating in the virus' contacts – the mosquitoes that act like parasites that carry microvirus, the parasites that are even more virulent and are especially protective against the virus that causes norvirus. in order to begin to identify the one organization that can produce a vaccine, the team asked ucsf and hackensack to conduct a test tube test for mosquitos grown in fish ponds and tracks the mosquitos on laptops. the mosquitos would be tested for parasites, and then zika virus virus, or zika e. the team found an abundance of mosquitos, which were transported to laboratories in california, where they were also tested to be effective in effectively infecting people with certain viruses, the team found. not every mosquito toxin is capable of causing birth defects, but both polio and hpv viruses can help and impair the prevention of diseases like cancer, stomach cancer, and foot ulcers, said study lead author dr. lloyd andreoux, an infectious disease specialist at stanford's huber medical center. that ""demand"" for vaccines, and that ""demand"" itself led the team to develop a new molecule that somehow would offer a potential host of human pathogens capable of causing disease-causing parasites and many other sorts of infections, the team found. this material was published in the april 5 issue of the journal clinical infectious diseases.",grover

699,"Melinda Gates: The women who showed me the way forward i'm not saying i know the women who are doing the best thing possible, but i'm saying that they're the kind of influence who i want to recognize. they were among the people working towards the feminist agenda that was at the core of my success growing up in new york. they made it possible for me to organize around, not only the progressive labor movement, but the women of the world that needed so much help to advance their agenda in a progressive way. as i've written: continue reading below advertisement and continue: a key takeaway from reading those blogs, that is, is to know the women who represent you. those women were the ones with no other choice. they put the third rail, you know, in politics. not conservatives. republicans and democrats have had no choice but to change the stuff they're trying to do by promoting egalitarianism and for americans to become more committed to the political system and to having more female politicians. eleanor roosevelt, though, could not close the door on equality and we should not find ourselves ambivalent about it. fdr taught us, in a very direct fashion, the most important lessons, and the children of the day, whether you were white or male, and what i learned was that this is nothing but the manifestation of the ethos of truth and principle. moreover, it wasn't class. democrats were supportive of racial equality. the united states was the envy of the world. the popular media isn't jewish, nor is the democratic party, nor the conservative, or even the liberal left. we all know that our people can get along, for a few reasons. one is that there's a populist energy to the movement and it's this aspect of the party that i associate with matters of ethics and morals. it's usually rooted in the ideas of a particular faction of feminism or the gender movement or something we see as human beings should be able to get along without problem. but as liberals we're all just beginning to see the great strengths that exist as opposed to the wisest things of the past. they want to create fresh ideas that don't really come from those points of view, which they've rarely been able to find unless they feel that special is what's most important. yet, democrats for years argued that they should have been more progressive. unlike progressives, they understood that progressive economics was an inevitable reality in a time of income inequality and stagnant wages. they argued that having a woman as part of the progressive agenda was the perfect stepping stone. and then they helped launch the feminist movement and pushed it back. finally, the moral compass wasn't so strong on the left's side. it did not fit squarely in the hand of others. it fit happily in the actions of the times, on the other hand, which was trying to get our attention and mandate more openness with a more mainstream liberal agenda. a new generation of people was beginning to express their appreciation for, and support for, it. hillary clinton was the change agent of the progressive movement. bernie sanders served as the defenders of that agenda, on civil rights and women's issues. donald trump was not america's nominee, either. and then the influence of these women took root and encouraged the movement to make the dream of racial equality a reality in the american society. it wasn't an easy task. these women have been crucial players in generations of change. beyond that, they've been tireless in providing reliable guidance and mentoring to those who chose to challenge them on their own terms.",grover

714,"SE Cupp: A third party could get us out of this mess by troy smith, cnn (cnn) — a third party could do enough to protect you, but then it could prove toxic for you. that's why companies are banking on a new gig-by-gig approach to risk, a simplified jargonish place to work on a variety of fronts: the so-called g4s approach. ""beyond risk"" consists of a three-year-long effort to identify the most appropriate risk-related behaviors to manage. in other words, g4s companies plan on getting your company out of these risk-gathering activities. ""instead of the single taggable tagline,"" says lance baker, a researcher at cornell university's jpl (formerly nanticoke research institute) and the director of g4s research international. ""instead of getting a handle on what you're willing to risk, the tagline is, 'how can we prevent the environment from preventing climate change?'"" g4s is part of 18 companies that will roll out a g4s service from may through july — and even more in the coming months. the programs are designed to support companies that treat climate change as a simple luxury; a recognized disaster; and that people don't need anymore. the result is: better outcomes, fewer such experiences and less climate change-related problems, according to baker. but those are just some of the tasks that g4s experts are focusing on. baker says one of the ways g4s helps companies push their boundaries is by giving g4s teams a way to trade over email privileges from the bulk of companies. ""organizations and employees have access to more appropriate email policies and controls,"" he explains. ""competing email providers also allow organizations to specify which technologies the server enables them to use for email updates and policies."" companies can then assign those users multiple emails — such as appointments, donations, reviews and status updates — so there isn't a standard hierarchy for lead, lead or lead management. that means managers can view whether to assign a lead solely for a call, not because it's merely useful. ""one or two senior managers on one team may have a team on that team,"" baker says. ""this turns it into a successful business case for the entire team."" mcdonald's, a restaurant chain that deploys the g4s software, says that contractors such as fedex and ups are more inclined to enter into monthly contracts than moving over to new servers. and fedex — a key customer for g4s and its three partners — says it's given more notice of its plans to shift back to a cloud-based environment. it promises speedier shipping times and a path to inventory replacements by analyzing emails. ""with the data on our servers (as opposed to our centralized data centers), those same users can move to a cloud-based environment,"" fedex says.

""you can work with the people you want in your organization, and then combine what you know to provide solutions to that,"" says harrison.

715,"Confronting the cult of partisan media posted wednesday, april 5, 2017 9:46 pm when i attend university in the american south, many of my peers continue to push for an end to the partisan media: the media the elite select and maintain. this, though, is especially true of all college and university professors. and the universities i attend have their own partisan institutions, which are as well. consider the biggest universities in the nation: notre dame, cornell, rutgers, columbia, yale, cal, south florida, and washington. college presidents are active in congress, and former members of congress and former members of congress are engaging with fox , abc , cnn, msnbc, cbs , fox business, cnn and other news outlets. i have been invited to attend broadcast dinners hosted by these networks, events i have yet to attend. i never met college presidents. when i did, however, i was introduced to media chief bob woodward who asked me why there was so much coverage on campus and radio. he then asked me to write a thesis on the shift in media coverage from its former, and admirable, authorial character. there was a huge surge in independent online reporting in the '80s, and i thought that was positive news. however, the media coverage have increased, as was the magnitude of the increase in partisan outlets: cbs a daily met several times, fox sunday and cnn tied for second, and is more than twice the size of the pro-reform huffpo over the last several years, my generation has become completely separate from the political left. neither pbs nor cnn exist. neither fox nor cnn have time to interact with students or students at cornell. it has been strange. journalism, perhaps, isn't the center of the new politics -- its center is college. everything i do at cornell compares to my predecessors. more importantly, it compares not only to my predecessors, but to my parents' generation. my parents graduated from college in 1964. but my parents' generation are now gone. the media strategy by these institutions that is succeeding right now, how they adapt to the changing media landscape, and how they respond to it, reveals a very disturbing truth. one of the most misleading aspects of college journalism is that they are aloof in fact -- they don't try to be conservative, they don't respond to criticism, they feel they cannot control their audience. when students ask what degree they received, they are often assuming that they were doing a thing right. when students ask what college classes they attended -- not simply what colleges they attended -- they are often relying on the words of the individual on the college website. these kinds of deceptive tactics continue to exist. for example, some media outlets have reported that the colorado springs college had admitted as many as six dishonest students to a school, sometimes double or triple the number of students admitted as told. time after time, colleges have encouraged students to find the truth. the national debate on college admissions has continued apace, after news outlets have focused exclusively on the selective admissions process. at the university of michigan, there was an overnight student suspension after a freshman student exposed he had a ""too-boyish-looking"" obsession with the bdsm movement. the university had a headmaster then. then there was the amherst college of art and design, where administrators fired the dean of students after a sophomore student was accused of taking part in an art contest in the jewelry department. that same group of students remain enrolled at amherst, yet again, because of (the host's) partisan coverage. the underlying truth is that these universities are not doing anything right. this is less about education, more about media manipulation. this is particularly true of colleges who are dominant in their own universities. these schools have been associated with prominent networks like msnbc, abc , fox , cnn, npr, time and npr, not to mention the academic reputation of those networks and professors (many of whom were unionized at their colleges). part of the problem has to do with the role that professors play in society. under president donald trump, colleges have been criticized as caring — much too caring — about taxpayer dollars. republicans, after all, have done a fantastic job at reducing class sizes in recent years. they have been very active in increasing the amount of money that the government spends on universities. also, they are expanding their budgets year after year in ways that favor student neediest students. there is a lot to learn about these universities. but those who engage in both their politics and the factual analyses that aim to advance their interests will have a very difficult time hearing from them.",grover
716,"26 voices on why the free press matters by charles m. smith senior white house correspondent, cnn we're nowhere near full support for the democratic reform narrative in the united states. we have a population under 40, where as the ceo of the small business administration, jessica mendoza was in charge of getting grants to many businesses. our government was introduced to the media by congress, which stripped two major media voices of their power. yours, the late editorial page editor turned columnist, john king. rulings from the editorial board weren't distributed to members of congress. and there were no hearings. that made us all mistrust government. after all, these were people we needed more than an inkling we could be informed by old news clips or scientific data. do you really think we are paying attention to the truth? we must. we see in the paydays of our facebook friends what we can buy and how we can find out about it. and we buy things by filing them to the press. and sometimes by friends. and sometimes by lovers of the free press. think about it. as king observed in his vivid lucid writings of the challenges of standing up for liberty, he no longer felt let down, and he admitted publicly that he was a ""man of honesty."" today, if we blame the media for the trump administration's dismal economic success, it is largely inaccurate. we are still in the dark about the failure of the administration. and we're left with the images that we wanted to portray to make people forget our voices have been silent for so long. and that seems to be the underlying theme for this political discourse. for the last two decades, freedom of the press has been a campaign issue in our country, and we've been working together for years to put it out to pasture. there is talk about replacing the federal communications commission with a smaller one, and it's fair to suggest that this could happen in a democrat-controlled senate. or one with no big white house. but perhaps most troubling is the rhetoric we have heard. i'll set the record straight: the current administration's obsession with free speech isn't just about the collection of evidence that proves republican policies didn't work—it's also about taking the fight to lower our voices. even when we have an elected leader who has her heart set on the presidency, we don't have the political will, or the legal capacity, to wield that power. a powerful executive insists that we stop pursuing laws that harm jobs. even the incoming administration has a tradition of bending to president trump's will, most recently when the president-elect nominated timothy o'brien, then the director of the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives, to chair the agency for public safety. we need leaders who are interested in civil discourse, who want to share the common ground rather than engage in global warfare. those among us who are on the center of the conversation will have the chance to exercise those civic values. those of us in opposition of the president-elect will have the chance to use that perspective in the fight to promote trump and his agenda. that's why freedom of the press makes our democracy great.",grover
717,"Democracy's immune system is in trouble. Here's what we can do tweet. like twitter! yes, twitter, it's the social network where many people will comment on news, suggest new products and often about politics themselves. but it's also like facebook, where people will merely digest the news and post video reviews for each other. but twitter is where the washington post takes its own political satire seriously as it competes with google's daily beast and time to attract readers. everything has always been and will always be different from the rest of us. i've spent the last year wondering if twitter is up to the challenge of taking on our once-rock-solid, inaccessible legacy. twitter announced that it was holding a contest that kicked off tuesday. what it saw was a way to incentivize contributions and increase the amount that people can donate. the company then announced that it would award $10,000 worth of prizes to people who tweet, share, blog or comment about what they saw or heard. those two were top entries. to answer that question: those who click on a link to the contest's winner will be rewarded with a brand new twitter handle: sheryl sandberg's twitter handle, the @sylsandberg. a $5,000 reward will be given in a lifetime. you can still enter. counting the winners is limited to people who can tweet their responses on monday. if you didn't already have your @sylsandberg handle, don't panic. this is the second year in a row that the group won a contest with the hashtag #cleananalysis. by the way, twitter announced that it will be returning to its roots of #thinknow for more information. and just in case you're wondering what twitter did to spark the study of reproductive rights, you just read that sarah palin's kids were involved in it. the trouble is, they're never actually citizens and aren't even eligible to vote. that means that birth control isn't that easy to access. but you still have a lot of possibilities. while you may agree that voting is a pain, how do you imagine changing our culture through the use of social media? researchers at the ucla shute institute said their research on the creation of a government website suggested a way to improve the lives of americans whose social and political movements had made it difficult for them to obtain birth control. it's just a start, though. here are a few ways social media can make us more connected. in a statement, ceo jack dorsey said: today, we celebrate 40 years of leading men who changed the way we do business, innovate and connect. we see the power of big ideas to impact society through active involvement and video campaigns. think now, at 60 million unique users per day, celebrates of some of those 30 years of badass female leaders. that was a pretty massive undertaking. but i'm on to something. do we really need any more women in government? well, quite possibly. but i don't think republicans are going to get paid if they want to. and i hope no one gets pooh-poohed at home when they pick up their phones and watch people in prison complain about not having access to contraceptives. i hope no one is asked about it. i hope we make it possible for women to voice their concerns —whether they get it from friends or corporate or individual or political leaders — directly. but i'm afraid, they're scared to do so.",grover

719,"Why the black press is more relevant than ever ""the fbi and congress should be laughing."" that's the refrain from u.s. rep. devin nunes (r-calif.) at a news conference where he sought to correct his oft-maligned report about the fbi's 2014 raid on planned parenthood. the incident prompted trump to dismiss nunes altogether, for reasons ranging from opportunism to a revealing defect. he suggested the probe was going, yes, tough enough for his investigation of the fbi. his next tweet referring to any probe with ""strong subject matter"" is a reminder of his insatiable zeal for the political right. nunes's findings of an ongoing investigation into leaks to journalists has stoked a national debate over the legitimacy of congressional investigations. the fast-growing, heated press has been a vital, if temporarily embattled, conduit for many investigations over the past two decades. it serves as a critical thumb in a headlong rush by the trump administration to end the partisan gridlock at the federal and state levels. but to those who favor the status quo, nunes's personal attacks are just a trip down memory lane. he has focused on the fbi's investigation into possible links between trump campaign aides and russians during the 2016 election, and blamed republicans for their failure to investigate possible collusion between members of the trump campaign and moscow. none of this involved collusion and didn't happen, of course. the story died along the campaign trail. democrats were prepared for it, but they didn't know how to react. that job should never have been left to a partisan outlet, particularly one that so frequently supports the gop. nunes thinks the fbi acted illegally and somehow lied to congress, and he has issues with the lawmakers trying to flip over the issue. when asked about the reports of an fbi agent planting two leaks at the arizona state department of public safety (psa), he accused them of being ""deliberately a political attack in the spirit of the committee on investigating hillary clinton's email scandal."" ""i'm not getting involved in it,"" nunes said, adding, ""it has nothing to do with me or our investigations."" nunes would be successful. but even if the fbi mishandled the story, it's unlikely they'll provide proof that the agency has in fact done anything wrong, like of the manner in which it found out about the leak of memos issued by tom bossert, the former head of the fbi's los angeles division. ""we have more information than information we could have been given,"" nunes said. the questions are the consequence of what happened during that embarrassing confrontation in the house in december. rep. greg walden (r-ore.) has tried to put on the record why trump made that decision, and he has two eyes waiting for the conclusions. but the congressional ethics committee is willing to add to the furor. the panel's advisory panel on congressional ethics will investigate the fbi's internal revenue service (irs) leaks to the media, and whether any such emails are relevant to the 2018 congressional elections. investigators already are gearing up for the outcome of the probe, as they are in california. president trump has made it clear he is fed up of nunes and his findings, and the constant chatter about the ""russian witch hunt"" has bolstered democrats' desire to hold the probe on the account of ""top political staffers."" but nunes may be right to do so. trump's former legal adviser, michael cohen, was indicted on a criminal conspiracy charge in december. trump could face some complicated charges if he responds to the entire investigation without self-serving complaints by republicans and special counsel robert mueller. nunes's goal is clear: americans should be laughing at all sorts of conduct while a scandal engulfs them in a partisan realm.",grover
720,"Branding news outlets as foreign agents won't make them any more transparent any foreign journalist who scoops a story that gives them a severe audience on social media or sports will soon face a double-whammy. the washington post's reporters, cameron bailey and ezra klein, expose some foreign agents as struggling to navigate media policy over a reported breakup with their longtime partner. their stories that trace many of these non-western stories back to washington, represented at least part of their journalistic modus operandi. a focus on domestic communications — there's a broad spectrum of the global press in both the beltway and in the workplace — makes them as infrequently relevant to journalists as their journalists. but it's not just domestic access that's undermined. the coverage of russia's alleged interference in the 2016 election, and u.s. obstruction of the russia investigation, has given foreign journalists greater access to fox and msnbc. that's why it's imperative we in washington and elsewhere start working in a new, more transparent way — to defend american journalists against foreign agents or foreign meddling. it's not too late. the stakes are higher today, and the news media in the united states must use their power to define the boundaries and the frontiers of a global industry that is already vibrant.",grover
721,"Student journalists deserve a free press too by andrew hill my friend and colleague, mary atkin, just graduated from a female journalism degree in 2012, and this year she and a small group of students from the university of pittsburgh published two books about journalism — one about the 2001 anthrax sting in washington and the other about the concept of free speech. my colleague, nick alden, is one of us, but mostly we're students and students of other institutions. we were interested to see what the writers from both platforms thought about free speech, and largely what they thought about it. i gave this title to a great book (entitled free speech for journalists by mary atkin, in reference to the nature line column about 'spreadability and the evolution of consent' in politics). he wrote about how the ""contentistic"" movement, he said, ""for many of us has become little more than a yawning yawn"" and to what extent do we think and speak as we believe? mary atkin and her colleagues—mary langford, kevin drew, and jesse mathews—found the kind of diverse perspective we need as journalists. as one of our esteemed contributors, i agreed with her. when i showed her a journalist posing a thorny question, she used a pen to elaborate in detail. so why did she put out this book? why did we think that brave young journalists should be respected in their area of expertise? mary atkin said that free speech has always been important, but journalists should have the freedom to express themselves equally. atkin told me that ""it would not matter whether [the journalists] said what they said, or if they said what they thought, whether they stood by what they said."" in my mind, free speech was not just just the form of written criticism, or as a tool that publishers would employ to dress up their books to give them brand recognition, but also those books for the success of the other professions. for example, writers who wrote for various tv shows gave unexpected and unexpected success by announcing that their subjects were writers. women writers encouraged us to think outside the box in popular culture, and writers who had an opinion that could be misinterpreted by anyone. even if we're in college, we're free to express ourselves outside of our free time. journalists from various networks and/or media organizations must take the same risk to argue against free speech at all. for them, the vast majority of time spent covering the earth can give us skills and voice that cover a variety of subject areas, which allows them to show us what they mean when talking about what we do. and speaking to a journalist does not necessarily mean asking you to practice your spoken word. journalists like mary atkin, who speaks directly and comprehensively, can even offer words of support and encouragement, for example, to writers who want to connect, even support, people not to be influenced by a message. journalists sometimes have to show us what's really important to them and how important it is to them, but that's how the small group of them came up with the idea for ""free speech for journalists."" i'll tell you why: because, as we all know, we are precious hanmen. i am so proud of this idea. it's so important to us that we must treat each other with respect and respect without it interfering with our freedom to assert ourselves. thank you, mary atkin, for upping your homework.",grover
722,"Media martyrs: Among those who died while working as journalists in the past 15 years posted tuesday, april 5, 2019 11:00 am one year into holding leadership positions in the government broadcasting industry, the path to independence has been very rough. when president trump announced in the spring of 2017 that he was creating a special commission to study the scope of the national broadcasting industry, it was ostensibly to prioritize new industry measures like better use of and investment in broadcasting. but one year later, this new group of bipartisan industry leaders seem to have stumbled, and, as of last week, may not even be emerging. many of these well-connected corporate moguls have been conducting interviews among their peers and their organizations in the past two years, attracting welcome attention for their collaborative approaches, free-wheeling investigations, and their outspokenness in making the case for both the importance of local media and the limitations of federal law. according to the financial times, vice president mike pence worked with the former prince charlie speechwriter in 1995, and in 1997 he persuaded members of congress to act on economic aid for syrian refugees. (three of them sought the same punishment from congress.) during the 2000 campaign, vice president joe biden also held discussions with the party and the white house on the issue, and in 2007 biden threatened to boycott the gop party convention if the system's elected officials failed to support the convention resolution condemning the islamic state. ""they're no longer dominant groups in the party anymore — they're already gone,"" says david jernigan, a u.s. professor and former u.s. ambassador to the united nations. there has been a rapid consolidation of the powerful within this new breed of media leaders. ""a number of important congressional republicans and senators, and not a few powerful voices, are becoming increasingly vocal in supporting the separation of powers,"" jernigan says. ""it's a fairly dramatic shift. this separation of powers is one of the major contributors to large-scale illegal immigration."" much of the recent upheaval over a proposal to restrict immigration comes from discussion of the specific barriers this effort would seek to relieve, such as the restrictions on the civil immigration system, for the recruitment of candidates for u.s. special forces. but the idea is catching on. and it's being embraced by congress, some of which already has laws in place, such as those concerning outreach to the elderly and infirm. it's almost certainly not the single single biggest issue the republicans and their new majority have debated, though the four senate senators behind the so-called immigration bill have promised — with the hope of being able to iron out major parts — that the divisions within their party will be addressed as soon as possible. ""i think they're willing to get together,"" says jernigan. ""there seems to be a willingness on both sides."" meanwhile, those efforts are small potatoes compared to what has been happening throughout the north american broadcast business at a federal level. comcast corp., the parent company of cnn, with its sale of charter communications to cnn earlier this year, showed that, even if it falls short of breaking even, it has still managed to turn a profit. turner broadcasting group, inc., a division of time warner, reported a 19.4% increase in earnings for its second quarter. the median price paid for cable television in the us is $18.78 per month. all that's left of that business, however, is to look for ways to be the most competitive in the industry. ""first and foremost, competition is great"" says jan lande, president of the nation's largest and most respected multicultural and multicultural group called media first. ""new technologies, in terms of content development, impact access to new audiences, and also new production platforms, will do more to improve access to and guide video news in african-american communities."" this year, companies including yahoo, facebook, and netflix have discussed potentially harvesting the popularity of streaming as news in the philippines, creating even more interesting ways to reach poor people in the first place, as the ratings of the netflix drama, ""house of cards,"" shows. the prospects, however, are decidedly bleak.",grover
723,"Why press freedom is your freedom saudi arabia is one of the world's most repressive regimes and according to cnn is a total tyrannical regime. cnn arabia seems to produce the perfect case for a new era. several news outlets have a record of using violent language to condemn saudi arabia. but why did king abdullah, the supreme head of the islamic state (isis), bravely use violence against religious minorities or journalists to deal with vicious protests? is it a matter of prestige or prestige? like all propaganda outlets, cnn does not treat its report as the state's home page. the government was not given the opportunity to hide from the news, nor was its distorting or controlling coverage just simply evident. to get around the law, cnn utilizes the ""safe space"" cnn is developing over in saudi arabia—a ""one stop shop"" for the coverage of events around the world, and a convenient place for anyone with a digital presence. as you can see from the chart above, even when reporters weren't using live footage, cnn has often dealt with sporadic, far from violent protests in the west. that's because press freedom is an internationalist non-state means of promoting information. cnn has done a u.s. plus handful of investigative journalism and has allowed foreign reporters working out of riyadh to work on cover stories reporting on any violation of international law. if you look closely at the times of london and other newspapers from which we are embedded, they have been deeply critical of the saudi rulers for many months. and just recently, they demanded that the saudi government remove us from certain sections of its weekly newspaper. cnn's reporting on these big-city protests can seem so mainstream, but the demand for our exit seems like a statement to anyone looking into u.s. national security. to turn against the communist east asian regimes in that region, you could turn the american media against dictators in your own country. this was one plan—which was based on my argument that democracy has been trapped in ever-so-slightly ""wrong"" countries, where there is no one, and no one is held accountable. democracy has helped create the black death and other unrestpots that we've been held responsible for all through the decades. and while every american understands that democracy has been trapped in ever-so-slightly ""wrong"" countries, if we allow conflict and repression to destroy an institution like a democracy, we are bound to do whatever it takes to keep it safe. there is no ""democracy"" to criticize. that is why cnn has built a government by consent of the american people. as we learn, they do not make their own decisions. as their platform highlights the really notable newsstand, cnn has controlled their own newsroom for years, and access is rare for the publication. so why do we expect outrage? the u.s. government has found all sorts of unacceptable errors or outright violations of human rights. it has undermined the various institutions that make those institutions work. that is why there is such a vibrant role for bbc journalists that employ freelance iraqis, and even better, bbc reporters in saudi arabia. it's clear that cnn's cover story on saudi arabia is largely engineered by saudi arabia's media. there is no identifiable ""democracy"" in the headline, yet there is an almost prima facie consensus among the mainstream media and in saudi society that any misadventure that occurs there is being completely committed by the saudi government. in many ways cnn is playing a major role as a propaganda arm for the saudi regime. alongside any failure to sufficiently defend fundamental human rights in saudi arabia, cnn journalists love a mission and are willing to pursue the underdog. that may not be an easy agenda to execute, but it is the best the media ever has to do to endure. it's human nature. cnn itself is suffering from the malady. people love beating up their sons and daughters. the same-sex marriage amendment passed in california is easily revisited and is barely touched by conservative progressives who insist it is a threat to society, and one used to serve their own agendas. for cnn, it is down to another corporation to see what their american public palates are getting ready to watch. it appears as if the saudi government is simply not going to recognize or permit independent reporting about the saudi regime to survive. but cnn is just one step away from giving american readers a new era.",grover

""take the irs"" is a misnomer. the irs is the target of the most sophisticated cyber threats in history, according to the new york times, which notes that the department of homeland security officials routinely use ""50 or 100"" cryptic words to describe specific targets, and who can blame them? ""the first one to be cataloged,"" said kelley hobbs, a senior policy analyst with the violence policy center. the other, ben hester, a policy director with emory university, said the maximum threat radius for terrorists would be 6,000 meters, ""with a hover gun to kill a person."" deliberations that will likely be triggered by a data breach, and evidence-gathering trips to news sites like the new york times, abc and the guardian, reportedly could begin next week in the course of a guardian investigation. on tuesday, from there, ""unnamed homeland security officials, including dhs secretary kirstjen nielsen and senior security adviser lisa monaco, were forced to hint at vulnerabilities in the department of homeland security computer network that could allow hackers to reach into consumers' personal data and redirect data stored online onto them.

""the potential is that if the person in question is a witness of a terrorist attack, we may have to withhold their investigation,"" capress said. hester suggested that some of the data breaches may come from ""a hacking campaign."" according to the times, the government's reaction to ""an unusually violent cyber activity"" near the end of 2016 was to opt out of its annual national information assurance agency survey. the survey asked all agencies to do a year's worth of things, such as sample surveys to see if they could provide more insight into the attribution of the cyberattacks, and which systems were compromised. this decision had numerous unintended consequences. first, cyberattacks may have caused personal data to be mishandled, possibly revealing intelligence of known attacks, according to the times. more dangerously, the times reported, ""it could mean an attack against the administration's spy agency, or on internet providers, which could be dealing with even more attacks on intelligence agencies."" the result could also be embarrassment for an office of the powerful, which already has been worried about its own cyberattack capabilities and struggled to keep its employees ""local."" ""we just want to stay safe, right? all of these things are really going to happen to us, to our intelligence organizations,"" hobbs said.

726,"What this will cost Mitch McConnell speaker of the house michael mitchum, who spoke at tuesday's joint session of congress, said he is not running for president; he just loves it here on television. while many republicans are unlikely to stick around the country to vote against president trump, their fate is yours. mitchum was a rival for the republican presidential nomination; which he failed to win. but as he was campaigning against donald trump and his conservative agenda for congress, he showed the same passion he exhibited in office that helped him be elected to the senate. despite his tepid support among voters, mitchum seized upon his strong support for immigration reform to win the republican nomination, even launching a failed bid for senate president on the strength of religious liberty. he has already voted against immigration reform three times (see ""turning to religion to advance immigration reform""). in 2017, he voted for the daca program; in 2014, he opposed it as it wasn't in his lifetime; and in 2012, he voted against the dream act; in 2013, he voted for a resolution asking congress not to fund the deferred action for childhood arrivals program; and in 2015, he backed a republican proposal that would have begun the process of comprehensive immigration reform. a fine line for mitchum: does the anti-immigration rhetoric on the left obstruct the strength of his campaign? or does it create an unsafe setting for trump and his agenda? what happened at tuesday's joint session on republican involvement in congress is a precursor to what comes next. with nancy pelosi at the helm, the new majority democratic majority has three choices – either surrender leadership and renounce the gop amnesty plan, or capitulate to a so-called alternative, complete repeal of the obama-era deferred action for childhood arrivals. if only mitchum's and pelosi's approach to immigration reform – explicitly accepted by the majority of conservatives – resulted in a vote to approve trump's president's immigration proposal. if only he would've stepped aside this time. while mitchum shouldn't play hide-and-seek with trump and his ""establishment,"" he's treading on the line to try to embrace the would-be president's economic populist message. the nominee to be mitchum's white house campaign manager would add significantly to the swamp within the gop party. if trump carried in november, mitchum would then be a thorn in mitchum's side, accusing the gop establishment of being slow to recognize the president's commitment to fiscal responsibility. if that behavior continues, there are sharp polls showing trump's approval rating between 40% and 63%. mitchum would put together a powerfully positive impression of the republican party.",grover

""the american people will not stop the democrats from repealing and replacing the affordable care act,"" house speaker paul ryan, r-wis., told reporters monday morning in his daily agenda in the senate.

(photos by triple screen) what we had was a private village of wildflowers and farmyard ferns. we passed through a set of pan-divided rooms, with ceilings so low they might as well be made a campfire. we turned our attention to the mountainside and the rustic farm of your soul you just can't get anywhere else. huge walnut tree, yellow milkweed, pink geraniums ... i can't wait to see him around. first of all, he's adorable. it's as if he sees day and dusk, eaten up by all the couples from the canteen, for no reason whatsoever. in fact, as if he doesn't want to be here. he's exceptionally private. he works his tail off every day — by his feet, too — and he sleeps in the neighbour's kitchen alone for much of the night. i expect that he's single. we're too wealthy to be alone, and i'm ok with that. the idea that he needs me is bullshit. the idea that ""her"" isn't hiding behind a white curtain is not true, and not even remotely humane. but that doesn't mean the idea that he's a dead guy is accurate. after all, if he's been able to take care of you on your own, how else can he possibly be this nice person? he might just have a secret partner — and nothing's off limits. plus, what a spa night. we ate a delicious meal, was entertained by two very hot paddle-wheel racers — caesar, salvatore, and sure, legos. but it was all free food — just some homemade biscuits and some old fashioned soda — all for nothing. i missed the romance of the buffet, too. i almost mentioned that we had the worst doctors: my husband's nose had wrinkles and he'd been like that all our lives. but he seems to know how to find me with regularity. of course, my wife is a person with a lot of interesting experiences to share. we made the most of our time without him. i promised her we could go on vacation and earn some positive impressions from him. halfway through our trip, we had gone all the way to costa rica for a spectacular weekend of tortoiseshell tomatoes, barbecued hamburgers, and daughtry monkeys. a friend bought us water bottles for the game of not riding away with my leg, yet to thank me for being so brave to make the trip ... and you believe me that his behavior didn't turn out to be much of a helping hand. i think it's about time that we keep our imperfections. when you see me at the touch of a button, i'm going to be fine. until then, do what i do. this article was originally published in tech junkie. reprinted with permission from the author.",grover

""as the press has announced to people, it isn't the trump campaign. it's the president's team,"" bierschke wrote. but the nunes memo, a document released by the administration for the first time last month, drew a number of unnecessary and politically-motivated, attention-grabbing remarks from obama's closest advisers, and summed up obama's call for increased intelligence-gathering for the country. the memo contains a lot of juicy tidbits, (besides what you might have missed if you'd allowed them to expand into a subject i love: the nsa and its agents) and has new meaning to the term, ""disarmament"": ""...the committee found no evidence of fundamental human errors at the center for strategic and international studies during the confirmation hearings of the attorneys general and special counsels."" (cia historian ken sena, who's written about these sorts of leaks, points out, correctly, that administration officials often describe their leaks as deliberate ruse to frame testimony by subordinates, not to intimidate witnesses.) sena has to disagree with bierschke about whether he had faith in the intelligence community's own instincts. but what is disturbingly disturbing about the nunes memo is that the president didn't even bother to offer a statement to the press on whether he read the memo. what the white house is doing with these e-mails and other e-mails, besides spinning a narrative in the press, is disastrous for its image as a policy-conqueror responsible for everything from the impending collapse of our military in the caribbean to the birth of a single free market. to use stephen miller's phrase, ""black ops"" was no more pressing than chasing down osama bin laden and the real ""red scare."" read more: must-read book reviews, front-page columns, movies https://pbs.org/ukpe/gwynn_alonyhtml&cms=115&rank=servings&source=feeders&id=ts&container_=catch#1653858728&x=1&release=page&print-image=81&readizer_base=0&v=0&set=a=2&column-image=83&mail_code=710039276&showarticleid=3163812&display_id=0&show_dropcap=0&hide_short=0&auto_run see also: nepa keeps calls for the impeachment of bill clinton and hillary and like top leakers and isaries of trump and wikileaks",grover

740,"Trump gets an unwelcome surprise when you ask president donald trump what his favorite medicine is, he'll point to aspirin, tackle a problem with cornucopia, hemolysis, rotator cuff disease, flushing, cough syrup. and he'll chalk up progress just as he starts on andrew cuomo, who is presiding over a second state of the union address tonight. it would be easy to pass up given the president's seemingly lofty vision and direction, but that's the way it is for americans. a year ago, mr. trump called for the elimination of medicare and so on while he was in office. five days after the 2010 health care legislation, mr. trump pulled off his first strike against the american health care system. his call for massive health care overhaul was met with hostility. mr. trump said his agenda would reach this country, not scrounging around for funding. he said the legislation would slash america's budget deficit, use new regulations, weaken the free market, and bring back business-friendly industries. he promised to readjust the government's makeup so mr. obama's reforms with a republican predecessor would finally be enacted. why hasn't anyone succeeded in implementing mr. trump's vision? while his stated goals are achievable, they haven't yet applied to his tax reform and increase in business taxes. president obama's efforts to repeal obamacare are continuing. he wrote that he was preparing to cut taxes for middle-class families, but his legislation only meets his timetable. trump is proposing to gut the environmental protection agency (epa) and the minimum wage, while simultaneously replacing the affordable care act with so-called insurance substitute mandates. in what's being dubbed the ""smart mandate,"" the mandate under the affordable care act would force more people to acquire health insurance, thus lowering the level of coverage available to the majority of americans. but despite trump's perceived disdain for health insurance, there is a broad consensus on the way forward: the aca hasn't been perfect. he has strong oversight of the law, but the most recent hhs prescription drugs study is still bogged down in bureaucracy. though the obamacare website has improved significantly since the election, these glitches and delays remain widespread. because of the increase in competition, trump seems to have a bigger problem than healthcare. there is a very good reason for such a disconnect with policy, including the policy positions of republicans and democrats alike. people feel they are being punished for exercising the voter's right to choose. but then, when that right to choose doesn't exist, they have an easier time learning about real remedies for fixing the problems. trump's healthcare plan is set to include the hegemonic theme of the affordable care act. obamacare acted as the single most important piece of government infrastructure in our history. though it lacked the will to replace it, despite the sacrifices of sacrifice, it was intended to address the problems of the system of government that did not exist then. at the same time, republican politicians and president obama fought to lower the level of government spending and use more judicial teeth to repeal obamacare. because their vote for obamacare wasn't equitable, republicans realized that the two sides needed to find a workable compromise. by lowering taxes, the gop realized that the affordable care act could be salvaged. obamacare and the aca have gone back and forth on the areas of agreement that would improve the system. that's where the trump administration is going for his ""smart mandate"" and the affordable care act. that means working with democrats to shift the overall taxes burden onto the wealthy. mr. trump has the ability to move forward on various matters. indeed, he might seem inconsequential when compared to george w. bush, who was not only president but an advocate of the affordable care act. most republicans think that healthcare is something their base needs in a relationship with mr. trump. while the president and the democratic party are not immune to this bitter competition, the reasons for having two representatives of the same people as the president are simple: the senate democratic leader chuck schumer, and, since each side has spent decades pushing the liberal agenda, the two democrats understand how important the reform is to the federal government. neither mr. trump nor his democrats know that the american people are, or ever will be, able to provide for the government for its most basic purposes: to solve economic problems, to care for the most vulnerable populations, and, most importantly, to protect workers from attacks on the most vulnerable. but between them, the american people are not ready to allow the republican polices of the past to control their tax and fiscal policies. mr. trump will take office but he's only going to have time to show why republicans should be champions of the healthcare.",grover

""the defendant not only defies the law,"" stapleton said, ""but he's trying to force him to accept the facts and the evidence."" the case pits king against immigration advocates who see trump as an authoritarian who uses the executive order to protect his cult of personality. a man who loves guns and a parking lot lottery can't help but see the actions of the white house as an attack on freedom. king said he considered williams a cop who fired a man who was unloading her gun at a man running a garbage truck before shooting the man. ""i can't agree with this. why you doing it ... when there are people that you can get away with and not race mad,"" king said in an interview with cnn affiliate wral-tv in falls church, virginia. the case highlights important ways people are battling intolerance, including an anti-immigrant movement that is led by nativist republicans. ""it's difficult to understand how anyone can actually get away with the act of making this bigoted comment without having to explain for anyone watching this,"" king said. in a statement, king said he accepts the verdict and is grateful for the court's intervention. trump has been outspoken about the nuclear deal struck by iran and mexico during his presidency. trump described the iran agreement, which is currently being unraveled, as ""a hell of a deal,"" warning tehran would be treated worse and that releasing thousands of u.s. citizens had been reckless. trump did not use the nuclear deal as a foundation for his immigration priorities. he promised to reject it, and said obama had not changed.

743,"Why Trump hired Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz by erik pedersen the harsh words that are sometimes thrown in the direction of defamation are common. yet what prompts the scurrilous behavior is an apparent magnet for the sometimes dominant emotion. the sentiment toward celebrity. the anger. the national reputation. it would be amazing if george bush had needed this. so why has trump hired kenneth starr, a former clinton appointee who has been sitting on the most controversial of sexual allegations against hillary clinton, to fill the vacancy in the role? lately, starr has expressed the frustration of the gop with voters and the left, noting that trump's tweets, comments, and behavior have caused a backlash on twitter. perhaps the gop problem with those messages is that they are crystal clear. however, trump is definitely wrong. the reason is obvious. starr has said clinton deliberately ""harassed"" him. for example, he had an idea of the reasons clinton and trump have been attacking each other: as for the reason they tweet hate, starr says that trump's twitter tweets serve two purposes. by mocking their positive experiences with racism, they add a contempt to the administration that ""represents a violent, crude, coercive minority."" then, of course, starr himself has said it would ""seriously damage"" the trump administration if clinton were confirmed. so trump has been picking apart the special counsel, choosing a hostile takeover of the justice department (even if clinton did not attack trump personally.) still, starr is on record saying that the clinton/trump stories constituted a ""biased attack"" on clinton because trump's public comments used her as a ""victim"" of the far-right attacks. there are plenty of reasons why starr thinks such behavior is worthy of impeachment, including his experiences. first, a history of child rape in america. and while starr was a supporter of george bush, he turned against him for too long when he was a republican candidate for president. starr also says trump's campaign was underfunded and dishonest when questioned. ""he did everything he could to defend clinton,"" starr says. second, starr thinks trump has been persecuted because his tweets are true. let's assume that starr would have said clinton is a liar. will trump continue tweeting when he finds out she's a pathological liar? probably not, but history tells us this sort of thing is not a form of self-reflection. third, starr needs a bone to pick with trump, if the republicans truly want him to quit the administration. additionally, his letters have been characterized as a rant against people he sees as ""shameful, obtuse, dishonest, inept, incompetent, unpatriotic, worthless and bad."" will trump and his supporters hang on for decades without a fight? that's hard to say. no one is saying the gop is behind these attacks on clinton. certainly, trump has said clinton's sex lives don't matter. but, by and large, there isn't evidence that the trump-clinton rallies are anti-clinton. fourth, starr has written a book about the bill clinton affair. he continues to write about it. even so, it's unlikely that trump will be able to say this anymore. fifth, starr should retire. trump's pledges to impeach him (including attacks of implied marital infidelity on the left) have yet to materialize, despite the chaos around him. sixth, starr is entitled to leave, but he should not.",grover
744,"Cracks emerge in Trump's wall of GOP support (cnn) - president donald trump and congressional republicans must get approval before moving ahead with building a border wall. after months of delays, the white house on thursday pointed to an ""open question"" about whether the wall will take more than a year to finish and for which government might pay for it. lawmakers from both parties expressed concern on thursday that the president would not compromise on a wall built near the us-mexico border that has generated criticism for being too costly and too broad. trump pledged in his inaugural address that the wall would be built while he was inaugurated. even after months of delays, it has finally been given the green light by congressional leaders -- leaders from both parties -- to begin construction, at what's called a ""phased start"" period. ""we can put a wall on our southern border with other nations for our jobs, our farms, our precious homeland,"" trump said in the audience, a surprise to many republicans.

""the era of president trump being elected wasn't only an aberration. it was a good one,"" rep. jason chaffetz, r-utah, said of trump's rise to the presidency. the national republican congressional committee, along with house speaker paul ryan, r-wis., was promoting the prospect of building the wall, which is based on the high-tech senate map and designed to avoid a political scandal. but by thursday morning, it was being questioned whether the expectation for moving ahead without a reliable, local funding source was to prevail over the white house's negotiating leverage. ryan and other republicans said a clear trump victory was likely this year, but that they no longer have the same level of confidence in the ability of the white house to make a decision and prevent the shutdown from reaching a second significant point in months. sen. david perdue, r-ga., also wants congress to decide when a ""billion-dollar question"" about funding the wall and the possible cost of raising it was a ""gone fact"" -- despite the quick passage of legislation to fund it in january. and committee chairman bob goodlatte, r-va., said the work should be done by next week. ""are these measures sufficient money to begin construction as president trump promised? of course not. now the good news is, as i look back on today, the answer is no,"" he said.",grover

747,"The Joker's warning for Trump and Democrats a weekend in which the president is supposed to say ""get away from it"" and, as he continues to insist that russia's meddling in the 2016 election cannot and should not be allowed to happen, spurred multiple new political probes. of course the results so far have been conflicting in nature, yet president trump's defiance of the mueller probe of russian interference and campaign finance baulks at logic, although the truth is still coming out and the mueller probe may be his best chance yet to finally resolve a very bad relationship with his daughter and transition team. it should also be noted that trump made his first political speech friday night, a victory for his diva-like campaign management team. under obama, president obama's administration — like its presidents in recent decades — had a long history of dysfunction and dysfunctionality, and could have found an infusion of people to work on issues that would certainly give this administration a good shot. the problem is that the trump administration could not address these issues in a manner that worked, even after president obama decamped to the oval office in 2013 and 2017. on this subject, there is, to put it bluntly, absolutely nothing republicans or democrats can do to change this atmosphere. for president trump, it's time to begin the process of fixing problems and solving problems, rather than becoming a mere exercise in ""just-in-time-drain-your-bucket-drain"" governance. take the fact that president trump signed a new executive order aimed at ending ice's abuses of racial and religious categories and ending unnecessary immigration from six mainly-sanctuary states. the white house surely didn't want president trump to sign it because of the threat it posed to public safety, the impact of recent mass shootings, and the environment. the order, obama's, was an acceptable solution to many problems. it was also one that was highly recommended by some early economists — including robert shiller, martin feldstein, and albert l. katz — and it was widely approved by many white house professionals as a successful measure. there have, however, been some bumps along the way, particularly with some crucial pieces of legislation affected by last year's disastrous midterm elections. last year, there was a strong and powerful pushback to the new executive order, largely from a media campaign with the mantra, ""ridiculous!"" when president trump released his response, he claimed to be responding to those across the country who opposed the order. he pledged that he would follow through with the order and its enforcement steps in response to the resulting campaign messages and concerns. i'll know if that statement is true but the fact is, president trump is now making a lot of fans out of trying to figure out what caused this executive order. the directive from the homeland security department encourages political and racial profiling and makes clear that the department of homeland security is essentially acting in concert with the fbi. trump has not said what triggered the order, but as democrats have repeatedly accused him of, he has never provided clear answers. on tuesday night, the president said that we have to speak out. we must continue to speak out to undermine the president's political allies and in particular, the fbi. he has not, however, been forthcoming about the fbi investigation into election meddling. that indicates that one man cannot then discredit the whole process in the very theater of a just-in-time, ""just-in-time"" approach. if the new executive order is based on above-board explanations and methods, rather than urgent actions, it would seem that the governing bodies and the us national security agency are dangerously lacking — or are merely overlooked for ideological reasons. such an action is not what the trump administration should be pursuing. it would be dangerous and disruptive — for the economy, for the culture of the american way of life, for society itself. all the groups and individuals who worked to create this unprecedented and illegal order are in for a great deal of personal hardship and short-term pain — having been instrumental in this process and helping trump on this very dangerous path. no one can deny the importance of acting to protest and to represent and make a difference. this is a very different political moment, and it's necessary to make sure we can do that again. turning a new light on this event or two will be both a challenge and a blessing to all in this country. for more from nicholas freng, click here.",grover

749,"I was married with 2 kids when I realized I'm gay the question from a man my age was: ""where am i now?"" as the wedding dress came up and feathers began to fly, i couldn't help but wonder what was on me. i turned to his dad, told him i loved him, and finally shut the door. it was an uncomfortable moment, and then i realised i'd lost my humanity. homosexuality has been one of the most shocking aspects of the catholic church since the creation of a definition of what constituted marriage on march 6, 1968. some 6,000 of the largest catholic bishops have declared it illegal, and president george w. bush has been harshly criticized for his willingness to divide the church into increasingly secular branches. i was not gay at the time, and i could certainly have explored that issue in a different way, without getting as close to an authentic confession as i could possibly have. even though i had always believed the full word, i put in a neutral stance at the time, to see in the current changing field it's not something i'd find anywhere near my authentic self. this isn't a change of heart, and i'm sure many catholics will listen to the argument that homosexual conversion is inherently intolerable. i've never said that, but i do see it as immoral and i'm glad to see that it's becoming more and more common. but we've come a long way, and the outrage that brought me here today is something that will only be felt in a different way. even by catholicism's most conservative members, homosexual conversion is on an increase. only a few protestant denominations, including the united states presbyterian church (u.s.a.), have approved gay marriage. lgbt americans continue to outnumber their counterparts in other denominations, and church officials acknowledge that sin often attracts more librarians. although u.s.a. no longer considers same-sex marriage legal in its territories, there have been many church member protests that have led to restrictions on the practice, such as having lesbian worship and online guilds. with two children in the home we've built, the future is bright, and the embarrassment that came just now is a smile i'll never forget. i don't know if it's been the right call for my parents to continue being gay as catholics, or a legitimate and justifiable reason. some situations in which bishops are shown to be evil are understandable and one thing catholicism has done is to get out of the way while learning to live within our own means. so, as i've made my decision in good faith, i feel as though we're now putting aside the irreconcilable differences between others to learn to live life in the spirit of the people we love. the church is still best because it isn't only for catholics who want to redefine their faith. it can make assumptions about others that need to be clarified. this year, i will spend my part of my final year participating in fall semester church, shedding light on the ""gay liberation movement, the nation's leading church evangelist,"" to speak at a high school reunion and advocate on behalf of lgbt individuals in predominantly catholic and conservative churches. because, as i said, we've made the same mistake. we live in a time in which, as the gay movement gains wider acceptance, claims to be straight or gay marriage progress are judged differently. but i want you to know i've changed my mind about our relationship. i'm no longer going to say the word am i gay. it's not a new thing. it's a time in the history of the church that's experienced racial differences in one sense and also of personal status. we must be ready to re-evaluate what we do in this moment. we must update our way of life to embrace homosexual love, because gay marriage offers a glimpse into the deep and beautiful meaning of love. there's been a significant upheaval, and we shouldn't expect that the world will ignore us, but it's happening. now is the time for us to make that sacrifice, our faith and the freedom we do need. i can say that with more certainty that my confession last year, and some of my others, will be a good example. now is the time to find a way to live openly, according to my authentic self, in an honest, loving and respectful way.",grover

""that was the worst moment of my life,"" he said. his memory of the accident isn't bad enough to get him on an fbi watch list. his parents did not want that experience to come to any kind of suspicion; it came when the fbi noticed his bag of candy, which they said was homemade explosives, had popped out when they opened his shoe compartment. and they said, by the time they found out that the house had been evacuated, he was already dead. it wasn't easy for his family to overcome the shock of what happened, including the loss of his academic career. then tragedy struck. their son, charles brown, died in the bombing of a german hotel in new york city in 1995, and his friends, including roommate michael raye, were killed in a terrorist attack in jakarta, indonesia in 2004. all of these events have haunted collins since then. they were never put into any sort of ""support""–that would be an easy thing to explain to a grown-up. his parents have been trying to bury the word ""coup"" from the phrase, ""hip hop is to blame"" from the taylor kinney school shooting in oklahoma city in 1999. his mother, linda collins, has mixed feelings about it, although she acknowledges it's hard not to. ""i'm glad that it won't make me feel bad,"" she told cnn's investigative news program, hardball. ""i'm glad it didn't hit. i didn't enjoy it when it happened. i don't think anybody should tell their kids."" ""he was fearless,"" raye added.

""censor with respect,"" tweeted cnn's carolyn maazel, who wouldn't reveal the name of the news channel's director of diversity. cnn says the reason it complied with the request was that it was a channel employee, not an individual: ""we at cnn object to threats of negative publicity."" an all-white, colorblind and independent newsroom has existed since 1967, according to cnn's diversity command center in washington. the team made diversity an appointment a year earlier in 1997, when hundreds of black journalists were hired. cnn's list of ""criticizing"" stations includes ""#reported"" stations that have experienced a black newsroom manager following a recent investigation. cnn says the company does not answer all of the complaints. cbs announced a diversity audit in october. the company said the practice spanned 30 years and could be set aside, after a series of accusations that several media institutions were ignored. at the time, the network said it was conducting a review of diversity and oversight and reviewing employees' views on media issues. fox was not accessible in some reporting, but two news outlets verified they were based on the diversity audit by cnn: the new york daily and bloomberg. the new york times said its editor-in-chief aaron rupar wrote a memo on the newsroom's diversity. at fox, the 14-member board recommended the hiring of at least three minority employees. but that recommendation was rejected because of concerns about fox's efforts to intimidate and censor news organizations. cnn previously hired three minority men, four men and one woman, as fill-in co-hosts.",grover

(full disclosure: i have some science-science facts that are not in this article.) we have passed our first national climate commitment from president trump, in january of this year, when over 2 million acres of land is being sued over some sort of pollution. i'm not the first to admit the allegations are true, but i would blame trump for seeing that particular report, and imploring him to change course. his action has been widely condemned as an ""unlawful act."" how many out there feel the same way? how many heartbroken parents say they were not allowed to continue using their kids' clean, safe outdoor space without retribution? how many other parents don't bother to keep up their school climate programs because they fear that ""climate justice"" will be reached elsewhere if they don't feel they're the ones doing it? president trump does not have time to fix them, and the first step is to start doing something about it. (that's an important topic, and we'll find out what we do next.) one potential policy should get us in a room and listen. social science professor zandra buckley, the chairman of the white house-affiliated center for science education and the environment, told cnn they need 1,000 community members to submit ideas and proposals to change the climate, and people are circulating ideas at a recent meeting. (it should also get elected, so those in control of decisions to address climate change, like democrats in congress, can call themselves ""free conservatives"" and ""enforcers of science."") the best advice? don't smoke out of activists, hate for the opposition to certain people, hate the list, and don't let things be personal. eventually, we have to look at something more from a more universal perspective, because a balance on this particular issue matters. if we're losing focus on the importance of climate change, we may as well be on vacation—after all, travel permits are a luxury for any and all of us, and our resorts are incredibly popular with tourists because tourists love to fess up about this stuff. and our energy policy needs to align to the actual goal of getting our children to thrive for generations to come, because the coal and oil, lead-fired power plants in the us and china, and the fossil fuel industry lead the way to almost no kind of environmental education whatsoever.",grover

757,"A dark matter hurricane is headed our way as it swells into south america, the sun has regained its glow and the moon has danced, but still the birds are still lying in wait for the gps near-by. for an imminent disaster, the visions we have lost in the midst of this war have become more vivid. ebola's infected villagers in liberia now fear that the virus will attack at home, and feed on all ages. ever since the disease began in the west african nation of liberia in 1993, more than 100 million people across the country have been affected by the disease and more than 135,000 people have died, the worst numbers ever recorded in the history of the disease. as south america looks to broaden its horizons, the disease will likely spread even further in the future. it has already not been able to wreak havoc on the largest civil war in nearly a century, though even if it were even a possibility now, a truly horrific outbreak would have been quite a terrible disruption for any country in this hemisphere. of course, there are compelling arguments for knowing exactly where exactly the virus is located. it is hard for south america to track back home, so information about how the virus is transmitted should be freely available. there is also the matter of planning, which relies on the human ability to respond and the ability to adapt. those factors are key, and in africa, famine has greatly been predicted. the numbers are expected to be much lower than what is predicted by the south american countries. where the virus is located has complicated the matter of how effective the system is. it is generally accepted that evolution cannot predict the fate of a living organism. for example, the survival rate of trees in the sierra leone wild forest (less than 1 percent) has been predicted for 30 years. but vegetation becomes more disease-resistant over time. as for the population of unvaccinated children, they remain relatively peaceful. one of the more startling predictions about the route of the virus is that ""control"" of that population could be a matter of years. but beyond that, no one knows precisely how the virus is moving in the countryside or how rapidly it will influence a populated area. a couple of things may make the puzzle of what is going on even clearer. not only will the outbreak slow down transport of the virus to the infected areas, but it may also spread health-threatening infections to babies. one problem is the phenomenon of premature babies having a better immune system. almost one in three babies born in this country died before they were even born, and the mortality rate from pregnancy-related diseases is among the highest in the world. when you look at the south american countries, you also have taken note of the poor performance of their public health systems. since august 2003, when ebola was first diagnosed, the country's emergency management department (emd) and health ministry have had little to no coverage. ecd in the u.s. has denied many claims of institutional bias, and their coordination with the government makes it easy to picture what is going on. that means for quite a few years now, respiratory infections -- a fairly common epidemic in america, including the automobile - are becoming an increasing problem. ecd general staff did not diagnose ebola until the first case was reported in 2001. children are also at risk when developing all kinds of skin infections, dengue fever, hiv/aids, and tooth decay. their immune systems aren't able to fight the virus, and wherever the infection happens, those immune systems lose their effectiveness. by the time ebola reaches rural areas, these back-to-back outbreaks of this disease that it has roared into have become apparent in remote parts of the country. from a distance, it is hard to imagine that this could happen in a modern society. people are beginning to come to terms with their own vulnerability. take children, for example. they spend months traveling the country in three days from school to let their immune systems kick in. as children, they feel they may need to get more breathing operations before going to school. while they may want to see the new doctor, they may need to get their already weakened immune systems back into full gear to help them manage a health crisis. armenia, russia, china, turkmenistan, mali, and other countries in latin america don't have a strong ""mahva"" system, but those are high-level teams that are working tirelessly to kill it off and keep it from spreading to neighboring countries. there are no lingering symptoms of ebola elsewhere. to prevent future outbreaks, we need to learn to adapt and adapt well and provide more education. never underestimate the sheer importance of this decade and that of the next.",grover

759,"Pray that you don't win the billion dollar lottery entering the billion dollar game is tough for a lot of reasons. but there is one thing that is undeniably hard to do in that arena: trust the winner. in this economy, most of us (and many small businesses) trust the back of a lottery to be what it is. but there's something less subjective about the prospect of winning a million dollars or more. if you bet on a lottery, odds are you're going to get a big payoff, and if you're poor, the odds are pretty good. but if you're a betting person, odds are really you're going to get much better odds if you bet on the way you see it. i understand the argument that the odds really are one of rewards, but in this world, a draw is a reward, and the odds of winning the lottery aren't random. every lottery is designed to predict how many wins a person will get in a lifetime. everything, at the end of the day, is an indicator. unless you're driving on a highway, there's no way to tell who the winner is. the odds are done based on the fact that people are loyal to their investment. if you can continue to buy and sell stocks and bonds and cash out equities, you might as well continue to use your money in the same direction you did before you got sick. no casino, but lots of booths but there's an even bigger conundrum going on here that could help decide your lifetime wealth. if you receive a lottery in the name of investing, it's your right to buy the lottery with your money. in fact, if you win it's your final call. and if you are absolutely sure the lottery is going to be successful, the odds are ridiculously high (but, as far as i can tell, you don't do that right). if you bet money instead, you're indirectly losing. if you invest your life insurance, you should be betting the lottery a whole lot easier than the returns you're getting if you don't win it. many people will totally lose their investment savings if they do win it. (in some cases, you're supposed to do this only if the winner's death turns out to be a hoax or cyber fraud.) so if you're a ""typo"" investor, a lottery is the lottery. if you bet money on a lottery, you're betting that the winner is going to pull it off. put it this way: life insurance is hard to figure out. your taxes are likely to go up by a few hundred percent in the event of the death. and if you're seriously thinking about taking on this lottery, you're going to have some odds. but you can always put yourself out there. in this lottery and today's market, you don't even have to worry about losing. you can shop around, enter the lottery even if it isn't approved by the lottery commission, and share your odds. you also can get in the lottery and try to value your odds against losing the game. turn your money into $1,000 ... this is my third season as a proponent of investing your money in lottery games. i've convinced millions of people to enter tournaments, tournaments and alliances through facebook and linkedin. over the past year, i've picked up 500 or so people each through my facebook page – more than the number of competitors that i've spoken with. but the most compelling thing about facebook and twitter was how powerful their services were and how much this generated. in an email interview, i was stunned to learn that so many of my favorite sports fans have these opportunities. if they bet on this sport, then the odds of winning it are more or less the same (but that's not an easy fact to figure out). the single biggest advantage, of course, is that it puts you in the position of buying a lottery ticket. i believe the key is to be invested correctly. that's especially true if you're a ticket collector, like myself. read the full post here.",grover

762,"Michael Cohen implicates Trump in hush money scheme as the top lawyer to donald trump, michael cohen crafted an astonishing scheme in which he married an italian woman without consent, extorted the payment of $130,000 for his work and then extorted $20,000 out of a miami lawyer whose client allegedly agreed to stay quiet. trump associates were also accused in last week's strangled by mueller appointment of a former assistant director of the fbi's moscow investigation. but as the mad money host, cnbc's mike huckabee, put it, the scheme was ""untold."" huckabee called cohen a ""financial scumbag"" for being ""stupid"" for duping his client into agreeing to work for him without ever calling the fbi. the jailing of cohen is an extraordinary development and fresh sign that the criminal justice system is beginning to adopt a strategy to deter the sort of political violence that has occurred in the u.s. since 9/11. the message is clear. if there is a silver lining, it is in the distorting and suffocating tendencies of the criminal justice system: it is tightening its hair. there is nothing inherently menacing about this. it is simply a small-scale, subconscious cultural transformation. all that is unclear to one explanation — namely, who knows? the jury really hasn't yet concluded the adage that ""what crime has long been observed is that a lie has been more often than not pursued."" for all of this, the criminal justice system still draws broad layers of scrutiny, particularly in those cases where a person falls for the bait. president donald trump's business empire is his greatest political liability. it is not only the law enforcement agency that is liable to pay cohen for his escapades, but also the media, who have infiltrated his white house and perhaps other white house establishments. the trump family may be forced to shoulder some responsibility for the actions of his lawyer — but they're not required to do so. the white house can be added to the purview of the bar for the work cohen has done. but for the prosecution of the president, the status of an ordinary person on the other side of the law is irrevocably eroded. it is curious that john lewis, an attorney who once performed his own dirty work and was included in an investigation into whether he planted a false dossier on hillary clinton, might want to address his client's alleged conduct with a lawyer rather than her agents for the campaign. when john lewis is accused of writing a quid pro quo agreement, an information agent would be off his top-secret list of legal transgressions. trump is a matter of national security — and trump should be accused of having snuck under the radar of a terrorism investigation. but president donald trump is a matter of public integrity. and for which he should have been sanctioned, scandal or whatever is offered from the president's camp. to be clear, the president as well as the democrats who have the upper hand — and influence over the criminal justice system — are accusing the fbi of violating civil rights by acting in concert with the obama administration. cohen has framed trump as a human-rights abuser. the president as a candidate. the father of an addict. trump as a business magnate. trump's lawyers have said in glowing terms that he has always been a civil servant and that is he as much an opportunist as trump. the president is an opportunist. for the likeliest reason: he once, like his father, was a priest. and for the likeliest reason: trump should be accused of having learned from his own worst impulses — and his own self-destructive impulses — that granting him privileged access to the inner workings of his business was good policy. for what it's worth, congress is investigating a russian email investigation that the special counsel is mounting.",grover

Then millions had their say through a combination of unusual photos of tens of thousands of people with their say and recording and publishing audio data in various formats, there's been a rapid increase in the number of people whose say they'd received an image of a person/story they disagree with. in addition to twitter has embraced photo and video chat, reddit/adopton has even embraced it, via announcement to the web of a gigantic global body of photography a group called photographers anonymous. they've spread online, and thousands have tweeted or blogged about their ideas. the uproar over the video revealed the fundamental problem with the photography of people, the unfortunate truth that the other side is out there and can make a name for itself. both can be found on the professional and the professional borders of sites like instagram, youtube, and wordpress, but this has been the most complex to work with on an app or video call. even the ordinary dogeridoo thinks that selfies and e-dens aren't any different from people who don't want a picture taken and what their face looks like. and we're not talking how much of a technical marvel that would be, beyond posting whatever photos for free on the web, then awarding them prizes. we may not always have the right address where the most transparent selfie is supposed to be, but when someone wants to say something that doesn't follow any of the rules of etiquette, they can speak loud enough to make the roll roll roll. images and video i've written before about the enormous amount of viewers who are watched through skits on animated kids shows, fashion shows, and hours of digital content, i've talked to dozens of people whose voice was so clamped that they seemed entirely blank. people often blow up as sarcasm seemed to fly, even when there wasn't a skit on set. but sometimes the scenario becomes so incomprehensible it we couldn't even call and hide when a production team wasn't sleeping because we couldn't hear where they were. but the good people of photographers anonymous – perhaps a tiny minority of people on the internet who are the perfect medium to express why the backlash of people complaining is overblown and potentially costly – have caught fire among their followers online with the influx of files and screenshots online. photographers anonymous have have plastered caption boards on their news feeds that exhibit how the tenuous coalition looks at the publication of the video content. some, like photographer ardis blue, i've actually not noticed and even to a lesser extent can't share what the crowd thinks about his accounts. so each of our posts has landed on the front page and captions and we've been told to be polite in turning a very bad situation into a story or we won't share with you that sort of stuff. what will the photograph look like? what will the captions say? i don't know, and they're really annoying for an artist or photographer. but i've also never gotten much time to be open with someone and to keep my own private life private. and that's not fair to most of the people who would potentially get confused by the beauty of filming someone's selfie. if this doesn't change for the greater good – or just me – i'm certain the photographers anonymous that have been making such a push against what they consider ""selfie culture"" will be creating a larger number of valid criticisms. but the one that this group has set out to debunk is that nearly all of the groups only exist because we work together. maybe everyone likes a good photo of somebody doing something, but none of us want to look like we're not going to stop doing something for a day or so.",grover
764,"In 2017, Trump revived feminism, saved satire and reinvigorated journalism with donald trump's rise to reality television fame, president trump's acclaimed television series the apprentice, and the islamic state's fall in the middle east, 2016 was a year of new fire, fresh ground and renewed intrigue that has delighted media pundits and pundits ever since. the heady week ended with trump's trip to pyeongchang, south korea, and trump's stunning news conference in which he proclaimed that women were welcome. he caused mixed reactions from victims of sexual assault to the abc broadcasters who said they were treated as either a ""complete spectacle,"" or to a ""political oversight."" the breakthrough, however, came at the first of four major american television conventions, the correspondents' dinner in washington, d.c. in our analysis of the month of february, it was a magical year. obama blasted out, and president trump chided and condescended at, president clinton's fast track to supreme court justice. the world swung into action. in fact, we couldn't have gone a better gift than may 22, 2016, and national law journal's conclusion that whether each of us was celebrating the 10th anniversary of the civil rights movement, today or the year after, trump is here to turn history to our advantage. one could simply argue that he has the scale and dynamism of the media elite, with no history of republican candidates, a media elite that is not even among our ""greatest champions,"" or that he is listening only to the candidates he uncovers to rebrand himself. in any event, trump and all the elites, public and private, had the opportunity to play into the hands of our collective lives. people all over the world joined the entertainment industry on what are called ""high frequency shows,"" now known as ""high 5th quarter shows."" these long-running american entertainment, all produced primarily by black cable networks, is dominated by black men, who like trump tend to tune in to talk shows around the country to watch in progress, and their comments become instantly identified, with the kind of intellectual giddiness that is imagined in just about every election cycle. the logic of that ""high frequency"" concept is that black and white people follow norms and practices that everyone else follows—not individuals. also, black media often operates the same way as white media: it follows the same herd of undiscerning characters, so as to make as easily available content as possible. in their own way, black media spend more and more time and energy determining what the most popular or good shows are. by 2019, the argument that black viewers are best served by whatever (white or black, fox, nbc, cbs) they choose to watch online is not an argument. it is, in fact, a question of how to influence them. one might be forgiven for not familiar with the mall, a series of ""oddball."" nobody is watched by ""interesting viewers"" in the second episode, because the show airs uninterrupted through seven of the month. but then came reality television. as television continues to evolve in a world of time compression and reinterpretation, our ability to identify, program and even redefine reality is getting even more important. as with the rise of the internet, but even better, it is starting to enable those who care about self-expression online to participate, interact and learn. that's a paradigm shift. it is time for americans and other americans to support the resurgence of good television—one that is fair, not biased, and both entertaining and informative.",grover
765,"30 top takes of 2017 a big good, on a personal level? for ya? what's a routine man to do? that's precisely what marine one found last week aboard the ferry to bermuda in the midst of the cold war era, with full coverage of the globe from virtually every place imaginable. every week. so y'all, y'all, why aren't we being taken off our winter coat? delightfully, the bridge, among many others, was turned upside down. it was a frustrating time for air traffic, which served as another reminder that high altitude travel was a topic of considerable public discourse. on occasion, however, high-profile news stories were mistyped. this one was about a former alaska air force officer, shot to death by a fellow military soldier on saturday during a service in okinawa. the picture of the accident though, is quite a spectacle to behold. an amateur video, shot by civilian photographer ron sahra, shows the moment that beachfront huts, heads and faces appear undisturbed and again, below the surface of deep ocean waters. i already knew about some of these humbling moments from nearby nonfiction books, with the appearances of more typically conventional writers -- as in, ""if tiger woods isn't going out of the woods,"" by tony kimmerling. this is a man – real or not -- who clearly received a dose of sadness from the 1989 dunedin attack on his four-year-old daughter, heather. ""from then on, he has been recouped,"" said kimmerling, ""and he's never been ashamed of his past."" so much for stomach horror. ""he saw an accident like this then in his mind. then, all of a sudden, he's talking about all these accidents that have happened in the last 10 years, and he has taken responsibility for what happened, and now there's a flagpoles,"" said diane morgan, a human rights lawyer and member of the banmyfitness group, and journalist. it's an easily phrased assessment of how despondent life had become in the midst of a more sensible period. fear of death has become far too common for many americans. it had no place in the memories of heather's survivors. a lot of literature by wright, fudge, woolf and wright at least appears at odds with these fast-paced, public-spirited and successful woman-haters. ""this saga is unparallelled,"" states helen coonan, a recent graduate of the american university in washington and recent author of beyond fear, an account of lanau, an american refugee who was the left-wing journalist under communist rule in japan, her father. ""it won't make you any less afraid."" the issue of the post-election election aftermath will be familiar to viewers of monday's cnn special ""5,"" a david and goliath-style cartoon. it has featured taped content, six scenes shot on location in oregon. each dramatic scene has at least one strong narrative. but the animation may not seem engaging enough to make it worthy of our attention. to the best of my knowledge, it's the most intellectually and emotionally captivating segment of the programming. as for the images left in the photo, those ever so slightly ""deadly,"" as kelley details, are scrawny but not feisty. neither are the photo of the girl who's now 12, her mother who spent 40 hours months fighting for that childhood innocence she had been born to be held in tatters. ""everything in the picture has that 'wow,' "" kelley told me. ""to make sense of it is like living through it yourself."" in fact, i didn't even know for a moment about the scene on the set – or the franchise. but i've heard from many african-american actors and comedians (including nicolas cage, mick jagger and, in one of my favorite parts, spike lee) that the accident occurred during the mix of promotional stunts to keep the event for the networks from peak cable ratings. as for those jet skis on the above photo, i reckon, hell, anything.",grover
766,"Why I'm speaking up about Mark Halperin, and why I stayed silent so long i'm not a generally well-known comedian and satirist, but recently, while talking about mark halperin, i must say i was aghast at the blizzard of other good comedy people saying how awful i am. i, at least, thought that frankly, there was a lot going on that i could not shake. the discussion was a few things i want to address first: i didn't care about the newly heated words that were being tossed across the airwaves in response to halperin's firing; i was ready to fight it, if only on my own. i think the attack against halperin isn't because he wasn't telling the truth, at least to me, but that it was honestly manipulative. there was a reason for the strategy, though: the people who let the state department cut halperin were the trump administration. and so, if you want to tell me that i care about a lot, tell me that i might want to play the role of empyrean or to say that, well, i can't. i read the press release that caused some r in me to vomit and quit, and i appreciated that. the press release points to halperin specifically, saying that i was supposed to know what was going on. it was strange and dismissive, as i thought: i knew exactly what was going on, and i wasn't able to stop, so why can't you do the same thing? but it wasn't a transparent lie that i'm suggesting. there's a very fine line, i suppose, between lying about something and being truthful about something, and it takes an immense amount of pain for that to happen, even if you're taking a stand and saying it, so why would you lie? we're in a bullseye right now — crudely, unforgivably, some members of the media going nuts at the prospect of a columnist firing a comedian. i can't wait to see the reactions to that. i have the initial shock. it's a perilous world; scaring the shit out of you is incredibly traumatizing. every comedian has to be out here seeing and hearing the windy and mostly overcast airwaves of outrage that is repeatedly spewed out. i've never seen a phone call that was so surefootedly come from trump's mouth, especially when the wind was only 100 miles behind him. i know that most comedians come up through the public eye, and what they're probably screaming at you is sort of the exact same thing as the show i'm eating and drinking. that stuff isn't ok, to be honest. so i have some sympathy for the comedians. i sympathize, though, with who needs prostrate arms like most people — a paragon of self-improvement who puts no blame for an issue he has no actual control over, failing to promote those causes he doesn't have, and continuing to perform despite any negative reactions to that force. the irony is, as i said, i was ready to fight it, if only on my own. if i got spanked by oliver stone, i would have been unfazed by the blizzard of other bad things being hurled at me, and maybe not feel the same way about it, either. but i also know that because of the public relations cost, i wouldn't have much to do with this. nor would i trust it — i'm a country-mourning person. and i take a lot of things lying down. and if i weren't in a bullseye, i'd be angry at all these people that are being egged, if you're so inclined. and i'm hoping this might help i can be more proud of what i've achieved than the bully in the army.",grover

768,"After baseball attack, the hate in politics has got to go (cnn) — a deadly car accident and the seeming rise of donald trump, culminating in the resignation of house speaker paul ryan, created even more stench than could be afforded. it also became yet another moral black cloud for the republican party, where special counsel robert mueller has charged trump with trying to influence the 2016 presidential election. there are a few standout moments from the bitter end of a tumultuous two-year fight that have made a significant difference in american politics and american politics worldwide. here are a few of the worst moments from the tragic day. but let's try for a second and finish this, because we must all remember, let's stick with a basic premise: a political system, if implemented systematically, that's great. a system where politics runs amok is different than a political system where candidates worry about reaching the next election. and in those elections, we see the republican party, what they've done for years. by demonstrating that democrats don't just beat republicans as long as they keep losing the polluter-heavy and voter-turnout winning body of voters, republicans are turning out people who tend to lean democratic. these elections have brought politicians to prominence, not only in the battleground states, but in almost every state except the south and, indirectly, the nation's capital. the south, where democrats would have won 43% of the popular vote, along with ohio and florida, has made a rare breakthrough. but in battleground states, democratic victories are atypical. why? the vote for governor and senate in virginia, for example, is 45% of the electorate in 2016. this year, when virginia voters split evenly 50-45 between republicans and democrats, only 56% of the electorate voted for a democrat — the number those counties deserved. it wasn't even close. it is striking how many more governors in the north american continent have republican legislatures representing some 13 million voters. republicans simply aren't social conservatives; they're multicultural, too. their quest for power comes mostly at the expense of their base, and as bob shrum, at a white house hearing on the shooting death of colorado university shooter omar mateen, noted last week, many of their partners feel ambivalent about their future. (the ""alt-right"" movement) has gone from shutting down fbi investigations into possible ties to terrorist groups, to blaming the obama administration's america first and its wars on muslims. the discussion hasn't received much response from republican allies of president trump. it's amazing how slowly the debate has shifted. how many prominent republicans have come to defend trump? here's an antidote: donald trump isn't only an extraordinary person, he's a narcissist, too. indeed, a look back at some of the incidents at the moments at that fateful white house, including: — in may 2015, a panic alert was issued by a north florida police department. the woman who first wrote the alert, whom police identified as a suicide bomber, was allegedly fed to young men after she dared to hug a guard in a public park. — on june 7, 2015, a car started to smash into a pole on a south floridian road. the driver was taking a shower at their house, and was angry at passersby. ""i just wanted to get out. someone else would have fired shots, or even more stupid things,"" police officer james gladys told a local radio station. — in new hampshire on june 2, the washington times printed a post on its front page that had jumped out of the front page of the new hampshire union leader. the writer identified herself as a journalist. several hours later, the paper went on a national wave of media coverage that includes references to trump's personal life and a photograph of himself on the presidential golf course. — on june 13, 2014, fbi agents searched a home in midland, texas, then arrested three people with trump's personal attorney, michael cohen, on charges of extortion and providing false information in connection with cohen's investigation into trump, the times wrote. — in 2012, two truckers were killed as they reportedly hauled out a shipment of coal for trump, the mayor of cincinnati offered to help the family pay the fine, and at least a dozen other people were injured in a shooting outside the hotel in atlantic city. the perpetrators, christopher norby, 26, and his brother darrin wiske, 23, were shot dead while driving the truck.",grover

770,"Bill Nye: Science made America great dr. neil degrasse tyson on a cnn appearance today made the case for the science that has had the greatest impact on human lives and the lives of millions since apollo 11 in 1969. science, far from being a trivial exercise, has opened us up to world discoveries that we haven't seen before. so, here's tyson's call for conservation, exploitation and extinction from both himself and yours truly. the ultimate goal should be destroying the last ten years of mankind's reign of terror and eradicating the one tangible molecule of life that we owe to the human race. i want to know about that the first part. people love to make judgments on what to say about what to do. some come from science and some are from the cult-like base, or whatever their reason for feeling left out would be. my motivation is to learn better and to tell and believe that what happens in the world matters a lot to humans. this is some of the most interesting out there (the science department has a phd in biology) and i'm not only there, but looking for something to learn and believe in. it's possible for knowledge to be sold and in search of knowledge you're likely sold more and less. my goal is to inspire people to give up the habit of fiddling with projects or people who want to further understand the world. the people i'm looking for to study the science are doing it—they're all masters of it. they tell their stories, they tell the stories; they tell the stories. their brains are wired to keep more and more of the information flowing, through the eyes of the beholder. as we age, our brains and bodies absorb more information, we need to learn more and we need to learn to keep track of it. there's a word for all of this: gizmodo. so, are you ready to embrace any of the essential information? i believe there is much to learn from each event that makes us world-famous. if you want to understand the science in a critical way in the midst of vast change, you can do so here at cnn. i believe that the most important thing to learn about the world and what you're doing is science at its best. today's cnn appearance with science director michael o'hanlon really means something to me. he addresses the urgent need for us to protect the future. our souls are not there to teach science. the world is not about making us know what it really takes to make a life easier. it's about making us aware of it. according to the american enterprise institute, scientists are dying, dying to discover, dying to tell. i believe that what we have right now—our precious knowledge of how the human race gets created—creates both problems and opportunities. anyone looking for better ways to understand life is doomed. the science does nothing to promote conservation, exploitation, or extinction. it merely helps promote our perils—be it in a place of abundance, or in a place of suffering. but it's always best that something might be better than no science. science is not just a science. there are no shortcuts when it comes to knowledge. the life course is what has been handed down. there are no shortcuts. it's time to give it to the people who can help ensure that it happens, not to the people who can facilitate the science it does. for the love of science, we are more than one country. fathaf simmons is the executive director of yes we can! the future foundation, a think tank founded in 1983. she holds a master's degree in education from the university of chicago, and a ph.d. in special education. she is the author of performing at masaoku sasaki on utuada, an original environmental book, and is a regular contributor to the science channel. more information on the future foundation can be found here.",grover

773,"The Donald Trump presidency: How the world sees it a u.s. presidential elections as a whole is unprecedented, yet the nature of the debate across the globe is kind of the opposite. there is a difference between the expectations set by those looking at the election results, and what these people are actually hearing, and what they are hearing. the controversy that has erupted is most emblematic of that: the trump presidency. who did it? how was it used? it all starts with the election. trump's narrative, which has been noticeably inconsistent, has fueled calls for change, and powerful factions around the world have stepped up to put forward a vision of america that needs to be lived in, where the american dream is truly alive. they've called for economic growth and ""democracy"" inside the gates of washington. the theme of american exceptionalism has been played out in the u.s. election games. some of the global politics of the campaign seems to have raised almost a class divide. for global progressives, what struck me most was not how the candidate positions were presented, but how the players tended to be. if you take the traditional dimensions of the campaign and look at electoral choice from the white-collar perspective, most people are open to debating what it means to be america. for almost 30 years, the highest-profile candidates' speeches centered around fact-checking — that is, watching the standard formality of the candidates' speeches for the entire body of argument. the resulting debate has been peppered with misleading statements and mischaracterizations, while the candidates have suffered no real obstacles. without a doubt, the fiery rhetoric of the contest still plays a role here, though it's hard to argue with the fact that many of the campaign issues are as much about the value of the election as about this moment. so how is america different from how it was before the 2016 election? the story of the campaign is a different set of dynamics. hillary clinton's rise from a privileged teenager who feared losing so much after deciding her father left to work for a government-owned oil company, to the biggest party in the country has opened the doors of a world seen by many as different. the key competition has emerged inside the traditional political arguments: the idea that victory is not about wealth, but about policy achievement. worthy and absurd, hillary clinton as a candidate made the calls for drastic cuts to medicare — the cornerstone of her presidency — and the national debt. she championed the health-care reforms the aca also passed, and critics contended that she steered a legislative agenda that mostly targeted small businesses. it's nothing new for this country. for the first time in decades, all of us, including the obama administration, have been part of a political contest devoted to limited policies, which in essence is about policy attainment.",grover

776,"20 top takes on 2016 the year of 2016 is spent on anticipation and fear — and justifiably so — and this year, as things get a little bit more open and personal, the challenge of getting through all of the stuff we wouldn't look at as serious by now remains unanswered. this week's panel are: – what do 2015 and 2016 have in common? – is it time to pivot to the future, or stop? – what's the state of republican response to donald trump? – is there no sign that a few months back, we can start voting? – what's the trade narrative for the 2016 midterms? – who are the house republicans who are looking to drain the next american economy? – is the gop satisfied with their track record? – is the gop worried about voter disengagement? – what's the fight about with illegal immigration? – who are the two hopes for the gop's presidential campaigns? ""the arts of optimistic optimism"" — and all things hope — are the operative words of i.q. rapper eden crystal. for the content of this blog, here are 20 of my top takeaways from 2016. 1. don't try to predict everything, but ask yourselves: what are the odds of you being voted to the left or right by 2016? 2. the two dominant republican candidates, ted cruz and donald trump, are having it very, very hard this election cycle. they are both making us nervous. 3. presidential hopefuls have failed to deliver the kind of impressive turnouts that usually propel presidential hopes up. if we consider 2016's really good returns, it will not be long before 2016's failures become systemic. 4. it's too easy to look past the events of 2016, especially the myriad of negative events in the intervening week. start the process now, don't you? 5. 2015 was a leap year for tech startups. when they were in demand, things went extremely well. for millennials, the tech boom pushed the media market to new highs as they saw in the need for digital platforms. for wall street, the tech boom accounted for real growth. corporate earnings rose a record. it was the third-largest gdp increase of all time. it wasn't quite as big of a leap year as 2016, but it still reflected what was happening. and more and more americans have graduated from college and have a way of saving their own money, which is now bad news for the country. 6. there is little we can do to stop trump's nomination nomination. this year's incumbents are among the oldest people in history who wouldn't be left out in the cold. the party believes in the millennial generation, and i think voters want it that way, too. 7. as people around the world brace for immigration policy changes, life shouldn't get any easier for would-be newcomers. for many americans, 2018 should be the year they decide their country is theirs. 8. trump has given republicans cause for hope with the fury that unleashed the gop establishment in 2014, as it became a pack of bad-government appointees and individuals. however, the other side of this coin appears to be bored and desperate. what will republicans do this year? 9. trump's administration is full of threats against us with all these promise to get and do to rebuild our infrastructure, but is the end of his administration exactly in order? what's the threat level for our airspace, cia or state of the art airports? 10. while democrats and republicans are finding ways to get outside the mainstream, mostly by building their base on the wrong issues, the divisions within a party seem overwhelming. which is why 2018 shouldn't be the year democrats hope it is. 11. take longer than what's already been, as republican enthusiasm isn't sitting so well. addressing the aisle and filling the subway, all the while offering them platforms for political compromise, is a bit too much to expect. the questions about why are we proceeding to trump's denunciations and questioning him as ""lazy"" and ""lazy"" make their most compelling political difference. 12. new enterprises will bubble up to house my young adult children at a younger age. it will be great for my kids to be better actors (in practical practical terms) than show how i make sense of their situation. 13. i worry we might have too much of this week, but we'll pick up here if all of the rumor-basis trauma fades away.",grover

""it's the best he's done in 16 years. the other presidents did not have to acknowledge that. it's very rare. the democratic nominees didn't acknowledge that,"" pope said, ""but i always say, in an old echo we used to talk about presidents, trump first gets the job for a bit. ... the fact that republicans don't acknowledge that they actually went after our president, saying we are going after his presidency, does make trump look worse than he actually does."" he added: ""the national psychologists don't allow that to happen. in many cases, when they happen, it is because the president himself is not able to bring it forward because people are doing their best to report it to congress. that doesn't make sense."" pope explained the myriad problem experienced by political leaders when they oversee officials on foreign leaders, ""because of the climate you have a president in place and it's unclear whether he's going to deliver it. i think we're doing that, and it is incredibly frustrating and this is unacceptable."" those who are aware of what the current situation brings and deserve a strong education on what really goes wrong on foreign policy can complete this task. but pope asked: ""is obama a sound president? if you actually thought about it, at least he was not terrible in the first place."" the next iteration of the white house must be better at the realm of ideas, considered top priorities, to get things moving. it needs to articulate its own ideas at the national level. pope's poll wasn't taken immediately or until a couple days before the elections. pope's latest poll averages that rate 60% positive responses from people. he suggests polling numbers in the 70s could be an accurate measurement of what to expect the next nine months.",grover

781,"Could Zika be the next HIV? (cnn) — yes, zika may already be a phenomenon affecting the brains of americans. the little known virus causes microcephaly, a marked increase in severe developmental delay caused by the loss of an infant's hemisphere. but in 18 to 25 months, zika may now affect at least a few new children and adults, just as can scientists' predictions of the course of viral illness for others. how much time can it take? you can't forecast the amount of time a mosquito bites a baby's brain. zika virus has only been found in some regions of central and south america. scientists are now saying its limited exposure in humans, its only known severe form, may be enough to worsen the condition. the mosquito that can transmit zika has been shown to be able to put on a man's protective coat in times of extreme threat, and even after the moment it's bitten has a repeat of risk. in another recent study, new research of high school students, who were part of a random sampling of 50,000 children, showed that the risk of zika-associated symptoms was lowered considerably by the researchers using a mosquito repellent. ""there's nothing that is going to precipitate the timing of symptoms,"" says dr. albert moura, a researcher at cdc and senior author of the study and a professor of epidemiology at penn state. if all of these findings are accepted as a likely explanation for zika, the transmission risk would probably go higher than even a mosquito would be doing, the study authors say. this delay can also lead to variations in the first-trimester sexual performance of those infected with the virus. ""if you did reproduce even in the presence of zika, you could have seasonal damage,"" moura said. ""could you kind of make sexual fidelity better if they transmitted zika?"" still, zika can be the biggest killer of young people born with the condition — the us centers for disease control and prevention projects the risk at 3.3 million americans this year. the original zika virus was first identified in 1976. then, the spread expanded to include possibly serious head trauma caused by infectious diseases. scientists on either side of the issue have struggled to determine the true extent of the virus and the impact on potential victims of the neurological neurological disorder. testing for zika virus might be another little magic trick, says dr. robert baumgardner, a consultant to the international institute for tropical medicine and research. ""in the end it's much more difficult to know the susceptibility of a mosquito relative to how severe the virus is, because some infections can occur at different points in life,"" baumgardner said. some experts think zika could cause viral problems similar to one that so common in african countries — the hiv/aids pandemic. ""we know that males and females carry the virus, and quite frequently they go through an infection before they get their antibodies,"" baumgardner said. ""but this could be another reaction to the viruses that infect women, because — you know what? they're so active at the same time that they're migrating from one sex to another,"" he said. ""the infection tends to develop around this disease, which makes women more susceptible,"" he added.",grover
782,"The real terror threat in America is homegrown our government has been in denial about our criminal activities, and our president has not questioned that. it turns out that our history is pretty grim: there have been nine months in which 10 people have committed heinous, nefarious acts of violence, and seven of them as we speak. below are some famous examples of those acts of violence, according to cnn. death to a bill clinton july 21, 1996: after a state department meeting, president clinton appointed former acting secretary of state george shultz to national security and counterterrorism matters. after an act of violence or death by other means, shultz ordered a weapons program to increase the ability of the un to combat terrorism. two years later, clinton made the same change, ordering additional arsenals of military, financial, and diplomatic items. leaving clinton to head the economic commission on terrorism july 6, 1995: the attorney general said hillary clinton's team had failed to produce a high level report that implicated ""low-level officials in the justice department, the fbi, and usaid."" clinton continued to announce the invasion of afghanistan and the occupation of iraq, and repeatedly put u.s. interests above the national interest. soon after releasing a monthly press report, secretary of state joe biden criticized an investigative report in the washington post, which had recently been reissued. the investigation was hinged upon major revelations about cia and department of defense surveillance programs. and so it became a reality: not just anything was off limits, but sometimes relatively, at any time. housing shortages result in mass die-offs oct. 15, 2006: after providing housing for american citizens in arab countries, former secretary of state george shultz sent soldiers to yemen. a pill mill employee had told the department of defense that to send about 5,000 soldiers to northern iraq, there were more houses to be filled. several people were killed in the response, and the public continues to criticize the military operation. army death by terrorism apr. 22, 1993: attorney general hillary clinton appointed former acting secretary of state george shultz to national security and counterterrorism matters. shultz's office became embroiled in an investigation into whether shultz's agency had used arms to support terrorist groups. their investigation led to a federal jury ordering the government to pay $1.2 million to a woman who claimed to have been the victim of a bomb attack. shultz fought the fbi in the review, and did not apologize for the investigation. world war ii-era alliances are destroyed oct. 31, 1945: after the end of world war ii, the united states provided military and financial support to the franco-american alliance, a major element of the $13 trillion-plus economic transfer of europe, africa, asia, and the middle east to the american military forces. nine years later, u.s. forces invaded afghanistan, and the allies died from the resulting war. in part, this is because the program for maintaining the war effort was integrated into the anglo-american alliance, by the allies' own admission and in part because the later bombing campaigns of the axis powers spawned other variants. this is particularly at odds with bill clinton's official view that international forces had nothing to do with the war effort. americans deserve better than these random acts of violence. if we thought these horrible acts -- terrorists, sex abusers, rapists, pot smokers -- were somehow state-sponsored, then we would be far more concerned with protecting the american people than terrorist activities. americans deserve better than these random acts of violence. we would be far more concerned with protecting our citizens than terrorists. what we are now prepared to do is help determine if they are real and run.",grover

785,"Rob Ford died of his more acceptable disease by cnn (cnn) — the toronto mayoral campaign of mayor rob ford has suffered a public disaster. he died of cancer a few days after announcing his announcement that he would be stepping down from his mayoralty. more than two decades after a crime spree that went unsolved for almost 40 years, there were no fresh clues in the 14,000-word announcement: ""i want to ask rob ford to retire."" ford's ""vital leadership skills have made him a successful manager of the city he loves."" his murder-plagued narrative of ""acts of vandalism"" — rampant abuses, untrue stories about the ""hounded malevolence"" of official incompetence — became familiar to the office of the mayor of toronto, adding fuel to the fire of outrage. the seven counts, which the ontario superior court actually ended on february 2, were stacked onto ford's construction business. also, the four counts he filed in november were publicized in newspapers across canada and even made an appearance in a youtube video: ""rob ford should retire in good conscience."" ford's epic, on-again, off-again, indiscretions revolved around his alleged habit of murdering and maiming people with his infamously gutter-throwing, chin-thumping, finger-pointing and cold-blooded knife-fighting. he was pilloried for abusing government workers, perhaps so aggressively as to steal from their jobs. others hated him for his indiscretions, and understandably. but then reality hit toronto in november. ford's alleged crime spree predated his ouster in 1998 from office, when he and his then-wife doria announced he was resigning from office. ford had spent many of his free time poring over the available evidence to try to force a possible indictment or indictment by common criminal courts — just a slush fund — before succumbing to a relentless onslaught of attention. but then he suddenly accepted an invitation from a friend to ""prove"" his innocence. in the process, ford began to shake off his taint of late-night crime and politics. now, it is entirely possible that next week's vote against him will be hard-won, if only because politics is so subjective. because now, in this election cycle, many people, both inside and outside the city, will wonder about ford's motives. and, perhaps more crucially, if his dismissal doesn't prove that he got off on one of the most questionable stories in recent years, then you know he won't be the next toronto mayor, either. ford himself has said, ""i think i deserve to be and i'm not willing to just rubber-stamp."" will this result in the horrific death of his real or bogus crime? after all, ford's best efforts before, during and after the november election trail failed to dispel public outrage that the government had ignored and conspired to cover up ford's real crime and criminal activity. with the specter of another crime ring looming, it is perhaps appropriate for ford to talk about his resignations and the virtues he espoused. just last week, a longtime board member of the ford family held a bizarre news conference in which he demanded that his estranged wife pledge the taxpayer her loyalty to him. ""i'm not going to see bob ford going on to serve my family, even if it means that one day i want to believe that bob ford is gone,"" said kathryn mackenzie. she said she, her son and judy were being punished for taking the jobs at ford's construction company.

787,"David Axelrod: A surprise request from Justice Scalia president barack obama is giving supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg permission to offer her recommendation to a possible replacement justice antonin scalia, on the spot. while the proposal is not on public record, axelrod did give one of the 10 possibles on tuesday: scalia. axelrod has also recommended that justice samuel alito, elena kagan and sonia sotomayor be considered, including scalia. axelrod was nominated to the supreme court in june 2011 and succeeded george w. bush. in 1994, before he was nominated to the high court, he unsuccessfully sought seat on the court's conservative wing, including scalia. axelrod also advised ginsburg to seek the advice of sandra day o'connor, who later declined to be seated for a second term. ""upon the recommendation of her counsel, the [justice] o'connor admitted that she should be 'returned to the bench' as the new leader of the bench, and recommended justice scalia submit his resignation,"" axelrod said in a statement tuesday morning. axelrod also recommended alito to obama for a second term. she did not endorse kagan for a second term, but she nonetheless praised kagan for her proposed appointment to the d.c. circuit court of appeals. axelrod, 76, told nbc late sunday evening, ""i'm very positive"" about kagan and scalia, but added that she didn't believe justice scalia would find it necessary to defend themselves ""in court,"" due to his interest in arguing constitutional issues. axelrod will be joined this summer by ginsburg, who sat on the court for five term.",grover

""in this unfinished scheme of time, what you do matters. you stand out from all others on the world, and you have the power to change things,"" says peggy mckeown in the book.

792,"Which generation has it worse? (Opinion) i'm on the cover of that ""a seat at the table"" -- a young think tank called the national interest. it's got a ton of money, a folksy bit of heart and a lot of people really cranky. but, i want to break down why i'm here. the issue is that there are so many different types of people, too, whether it's millennials (remember me?) or even average people who are less financially stable than i am (though i have a square peg in a round hole). i can't think of a single generation where there was not a generation gap when it comes to the habits they learned in the 1980s. this is the same reason i want young people to be remembered, not their parents, if they're already here. one of the biggest problems my generation has is that when you look at my generation, they are incredibly irresponsible. the reason we are so irresponsible is because we don't recognize the consequences, so that makes it hard for us to handle ourselves. for someone that is as healthy as my generation is, and usually i'm pretty healthy but a number of people don't look healthy at all. so, it's not only me that's leading the charge. there are so many examples of younger people being irresponsible because they've just fallen in love with too many extreme things and they don't feel guilt at their end of the decision. we're not terrible people and we all have mistakes. but, we are lazy and judgmental. you see, most kids don't even bother to understand what they're trying to do. if they were smarter, they might think of the issues as simple, or solutions instead of elaborate fiction. i always say i believe in investments and investing because doing that is the only way that you can reduce your risk over time. if you had nothing like this money, if you couldn't get ahead in the economic world, you probably would try to invest in companies that earned from each share you owned every day. i've been told that not investing saves you from having to start retiring at age 30 as you get older. and my other advice is not one of denial and denial, but of the thinking that kids are trying to have a run for it. the reason i'm not a ""gap child"" is that i'll try to decide if it's the best way to live. as long as that's the first option, every step you take will be an early warning sign that the most worthwhile investment will be made. the idealistic people who are the traditional solution family are focused on getting through something with the knowledge that they don't have. they want to find true solutions and not just the last thing they should do is plan out how to accomplish them. there's a time and a place for selfish efforts, but life is too short for it. if i went to 20, i wouldn't be wasting too much time talking about starving out my kids or somehow leveraging the power of prayer and fasting to feed me to become a vegetarian. but i don't see you actually using your money to take life to the next level to do something better for your family. please, i wish the ""legal age"" generation could just be back in the business of finding ways to live better -- not starving out you all to it, as they say. sometimes it's a good idea but i don't know if it works for everyone. i don't blame the many ""legal"" guys, but i do blame the less well off of it who find it hard to make ends meet. it's time to put back the way we do things and admit that we made progress for what we're currently doing instead of let it all bleed out and fly by the wayside because we're lazy and selfish. trust me -- these kids haven't learned how to make compromises but they've taken some steps to push themselves to improve their lives and do things they wouldn't do otherwise. i think that maybe they would like to keep their family in touch with the past because they already have a relationship with the past that will allow them to realize that they have to fight for what they want. maybe their parents have learned something about them or not. in the end i hope they don't have to settle for something that may not work so well for them.",grover

795,"Baby Boomers: Five Reasons They Are Our Worst Generation because baby boomers hold their records closer to their full potential than older adults do, it is now sometimes an ok time to release their doubts that our youth can deliver for us. but they couldn't have been doing so much better, if they had their way. that's why i want to nominate some reasons why they're our worst generation — and why their adoption of our modern baby boomers, and their childfossil tendencies, were among the most important factors contributing to our decline. 1. immigrants. now that you and i are older than you were, i have an unfair advantage because most of the people you encounter happen to be people who have not seen us in a very long time — and often don't know about us. but that's a tough financial situation to live in, and we do have a lot of skeletons to fill out. while we may be people with memories of ourselves, many years of working toward full potential, pursuing dreams, and making connections can develop tendencies which can't seem to be satisfied. that's why growing up exposed to immigrants, and forming relationships with them can build self-confidence — a trait we already possess. 2. social security. we are the poster children for the generation that we are (not to mention those born after 1972 and 1974). most millennials grew up receiving monthly benefits. with their aging parents on hand, they may have access to a greater pool of social choices, but the benefits were never guaranteed. consequently, it became highly essential to them to get good enough meals and personal attention that they were able to attend university. but that's a challenge both at home and around the office — one that just didn't go away, and won't go away as well. 3. aids. in fact, my personal brand of education began in high school when i was a nursing student. these early lessons led me to follow in my mother's footsteps and seek out top universities. although i've had some memorable experiences with universities, for the most part i haven't gone the route of academics. because i've had so many graduate degrees to go by, i still follow in mom's footsteps — and just like many of us, i am known for going to some of the places where i am most proud of my career success. this field hasn't been a constant topic of conversation for me in my life, and i want to change that by learning about it as it happens. 4. social security. social security may be the best way to obtain your future retirements, but retirement accounts can be challenging to calculate and fund from. it's also important to remember that we are a generation of survivors. many of us moved on, but many others still with us tend to grow older and seek more competent career paths. considering that all of us have seen first-hand how it can affect us, i have ambitions that will help build our confidence and teach us to live our best lives ahead of time. 5. general motors. general motors, unfortunately, is not what you read. our lack of representation and institutional failure is starkly evidenced by general motors' market value and growing loss.",grover

798,"An Online Generation Redefines Mourning memorial day weekend is well underway and as usual, family friends and loved ones are gathering up in our home and the community to grieve and celebrate. below are just a few of the sites you need to know about. they are however confusing in the online spaces, but they're gaining traction in the african and caribbean communities. in those countries, one word in particular is ""rivals."" what are these differences? a.uats. weir.uats.yats. in other words, if you're a u.s. citizen and you earn $1 million, you're probably japanese who are less interested in securing a first dollar in a business or in killing a popular gay lover. a.uats.inoue.inoue.unfortunately, there are several factors that contribute to its breaking up in nigeria and other africa. for instance, poverty and lack of income have made the infant mortality rate among the sub-saharan african youth, about 48% by the standards of the united nations (un) and above 50% in asia, more than double than in latin america. the result of these confounding factors is an increase in deaths related to poverty, disease and illiteracy.in addition, more than half of a million people living in poverty are believed to be migrants. the prevalence of violence and unemployment among refugees who arrived in north africa and the middle east have increased dramatically.even the language barrier in africa differs from the countries under which it's lived, as more than 90% of refugees cannot use african and european english. if you're a u.s. citizen, you're also eligible for a basic income, but if you're a u.s. citizen, the individual would only receive food assistance and financial assistance based on their income. in the western world, there are limits to medicaid funding in those countries, which provides temporary housing, healthcare, food assistance and housing. the federal government provides over 75% of the growth and health costs of the north african countries. since the economy in these countries depends on two or more sources for the creation of the same country's economy — food, energy and construction — the need for a more equal income than a person's economic needs is increasing.for example, a father's income has doubled over the past decade due to increased consumption, with fewer dollars in the north african countries. additionally, bread prices in new york city are about five times higher. these measures by the u.s. government show that when it comes to assessing the safety of an individual's life, markets need to investigate the income of an individual. in some u.s. states, taxes are about $13 for every $1 in income.while wealthier americans are richer, many of them are discouraged by factors such as low property values, stagnant wages and student debt, which have put them out of the labor market. worse, many residents of these states say they are even less likely to find employment due to illegal immigrants. in places like california, florida and new york, people living in the poorest states suffer from grave financial problems.consider the above instance from italy. during the initial years of the italian revolution, the government spent about $1 billion a year to help build housing for people desperate to find work. between a 1980s reagan tax reform and the day italy was founded in 2001, the italian economy was dramatically affected by the loss of millions of italian workers. during the following decades, the economy actually contracted as companies attracted risky foreign capital and taxes were slashed. today, one of the best-supported economies in the world is the german state of baden-wuerttemberg, which does not grant civil servant exemptions. however, the overall situation has been significantly improved. in 2008, baden-wuerttemberg invested the equivalent of $31 billion in its labor market in the aggregate and has since made significant strides in terms of training and employment prospects.although the number of immigrants has grown, the number of people relying on the labor market has skyrocketed. new immigrants constitute 85% of the workforce and 45% of total labor force. the current wave of refugees entering the united states as a result of demographic trends such as population aging, more barriers to family reunification and a strong economic recovery, have just paved the way for an increasingly globalized economy. it's a similar story in africa. the black economy is expected to remain largely stagnant for several decades to come, partly due to a combination of factors including lack of income and market access. if your of a black american is still driving to work, don't forget to pack up your ex and drive to blackwood. on the weekend after labor day, report all your best un",grover

802,"Dear Ted Cruz... hi, what do you think of ted cruz making an appearance before today's cbs ""face the nation""? because i'm harboring a good guess about his possible political future. will it all be a relief if he leaves the race? is he going to set up a third convention in florida? can we get him to campaign until july? and should we at least consider the fact that he has the nomination all year long? i was thinking it might be the latter. why not run for president in 2014? hey, ted, let's go ahead and tie cruz up like you are summer camp rivals for most of this week. what do you mean by status quo? now is a good time to either embrace moderation or die before that. i like this when cruz does his running interviews at the ready to make things seem good on the campaign trail. ted did just that on friday, while answering questions from the audience and giving a number of other political-watchmen's questions. now let's get on track and dance with a difference. i think you should even consider a run for president, because very few people get to be a senator. if a senate candidate breaks through enough obstacles to become a reality, his opponent or others may jump on board in the second half of the race, hoping that things get turned around again. then, when ted makes the race seem quite likely, the odds of the senate contest slipping away so decisively as to jeopardize his nomination are very slim. so, if we're going to kick this ""serious"" energy into the proverbial slam dunk hatch, let's give ted something more than a watchful eye. let's start with question period and summary. ask the moderator. this is ted. whether it be presidential or private, if you're a politician, you need to have a serious view of something. think before you say something in public that everyone else may find offensive. plus, it should be kept to a minimum on your campaign statement. if you're kicking around whether to be appealing it or resigning, i suggest you press pause on it. you're the reporter with the issue. it's incumbent on all of us who are considering who we'll end up at the top to be critical of who we're criticizing. when it comes to delegating office, take a look at the man who sits atop the white house for a fleeting moment (except during a event like the one the white house used to hold for most of its occupants). vlaams malmstrom's style of speaking and crossing the aisle has given him a unique ability to pick topics that liberals and conservatives won't tackle in person. in terms of possible third (and last) run-off for the presidential nomination, i would only have so much time to formulate a viable alternative. it's down to you, me and my fellow campers. if you're willing to believe in the capacity of others, vote for someone! i'd quite like to see mr. abbott. i know my fair share of senators, especially now and then, who haven't turned out in record numbers to support a third party candidate. abbott was effective at such occasions. he showed that he can be effective, not just in a one-on-one interview with a questioner, but with every interview. he was able to get a fair amount of attention from reporters without ever becoming too distracted or damaging to campaign. there's no doubt that the race is tightening. ted cruz has gotten good press since his win last july. the current presidential campaign seem poised to become fun for as many people as they were here on saturday night! a little help if you have little mileage. in all likelihood, you should take comfort in the fact that before this last weekend, a great number of senators were hawking their own signatures for the k street community after expressing respect for a third candidate. most of them seemed to be in favor of a second group of three. now that might be a challenge, but there's no doubt in my mind that when it comes to promoting prospects, there's a reason for the abundance of colleagues. i'd cheer for anyone who wants to appear on the fox or cnn primetime debates at the beginning of this month. they'd only hurt the soul of our political debate program. we should expect no less than we receive in this atmosphere. the next ted cruz will come on the air this weekend. at a debate on the cbs broadcast before this week's presidential debate, ted will absolutely",grover

805,"Is it ethical to colonize Mars? (Opinion) and you thought the new wave of space travel was experimental. we don't yet know whether the earth is already colonizing mars, but, perhaps, it does. perhaps, we must now ponder what countries including china, india, and pakistan are doing to colonize the planet. these are just a few of the troubling developments occurring this week. from blustery nature to environmental questions to crippling emission controls, it is both great and disturbing news that two areas of the planet are planning to colonize their own host bodies. according to a washington post report, sobanes—already known as ""u.s. road greenhouse""—is now effectively trialing its own land volcanoes. we simply can't allow everything that is set for mining to end in this way. the hilltops are toxic, man-made, and interrelated with the rest of the planet. acid has a toxic chemical meaning it reduces water productivity, energy usage, and socio-emotional effects on those of us living on the planet. according to climate projections, acid spills will increase dramatically in the coming decades. (epa is currently working to curtail carbon dioxide emissions, although the latter effort is being slowed because of continued public disapproval for the project.) india and pakistan are following in their footsteps by colonizing mars. positron emission projections show that by 2022, similar popular concepts in exploring the earth will be repeated over seven times in the next decade. (in fact, world vision's planetary accountability index shows humans, elephants, and other endangered mammals (actually those in africa, asia, and north america) with more chances of being impacted by climate change than any other group in the world.) the demands, if anything, for increased access to space on an ongoing basis might reverse the ecological and economic benefits of colonizing. the power of these developments is being felt worldwide. some refer to them as ""fossil fuels."" but they're largely a monetary ploy. until 2006, many globally geared fossil fuels flowed out of china and india into the south pacific. the result was an entirely unregulated fuel-allocation of resources. a remarkable sums of money have been funneled into the developing world via plantations. brompton hotels inc. started in 1983, offering eco-oriented accommodation in west africa and indian ocean islands. their pioneers say the hotel's founder, thomas foster, sr., designed his own nest in the indian ocean to enhance the tribe's governance. since their arrival, foster, born in jamaica, has been the archetypal yesteryear, a ""triumph of wilderness,"" ""land for profit,"" and ""family home."" foster has developed a vocabulary that translates to ""east of the world,"" ""coast for profit,"" and ""new frontier."" he's directed commercial efforts to countries that come to him with a new appetite for experimental approaches to designing home offices. the gradual dismantling of the grain-control systems of mass-production in the 1970s and '80s (cost-cutting and terminalism) and industrialization in the mid-1990s (job-creating, and usually legal, materials) made the option of colonizing more and more difficult, and expensive. foster's saw his irretrievable mining technologies seen as just as stunningly feasible in the coming decades. they can hold up to the difficulty of operating these lightweight resorts, which keep the temperature of the atmosphere well below 40 degrees. foster's eco-civility model would be refreshing, and why not? it holds that people create new ""connection"" to nature. ""we will be able to physically sustain the environment by loving our environment. we will be able to share it with other people. then, there will be a bottom-up model, with each of us contributing to a new host,"" he says.

""it was arrogant,"" biden said. ""we might be morally on the course to war, but we are doing it with the best energy we have in the world and we were not willing to wait."" biden didn't need to go somewhere and stay there. he chose to go back home. when i asked him what he wrote in the cover of ""colbert,"" biden answered that he wrote back to the clinton foundation he and his mother were having a soft spot for, and it wasn't just one bad day. ""the clinton foundation,"" he said. ""i was lucky enough to be among a group of democratic officials working with a woman who was willing to do just that."" when my friend julia shouted out that her husband had voted for hillary clinton twice, biden said she could have no recollection of the night, so he didn't come out and say something out of the blue. ""every democratic insider or special interest group knows that debbie wasserman schultz, the former chief of staff, hasn't been a true friend to mr. obama or to our country in terms of service and credibility as well,"" biden said. the problem is, with biden, it is clear that we now have a party whose primary event is the presidency. and he told me that even at the time, ""you know, we could have re-elected george bush, or there would have been just a country war with syria, and then we'd turn all that around."" the president of the united states, he wrote, ""lied to the world about the possibility of a nuclear bomb and this was it,"" biden said.

""you know, you end up needing close control of your mind and you go into a completely different world for the first time in our history,"" he said. ""and on top of that, if you really think about what happened, the fact that people went out into the streets not knowing who was leader, who was leader-in-waiting, the press covering up their mistakes, the public view of the american government, that somehow it's not us that is going to make sure that people are informed."" in a world where the president of the united states is the leader of the free world, the first to step out of the shadows and speak up for the people, how can biden be any different from obama? his presidency should be a remarkable memory. as the country and the world go down the road that will determine the fate of this nation, biden reminds us, we're going to have to win wars, we're going to have the international coalition, we're going to have the major cities armed, and we're going to have the rule of law. biden has been living with these truths for over 40 years. i'm listening to the vice president get he answers out with your head. it's not boring. now come on. tell me: how can we win wars, and obama and bush won wars? by larry kramer good morning. thank you for joining us today. video of vice president joe biden's speech to the vice bet awards was being shared on twitter and instagram. click here to see the videos.",grover

812,"Top CNN op-eds of 2015 (so far) hot off the controversy of donald trump's immigration speech in d.c., cnn rounds up some of the top cnn op-eds of the last 12 months, out of friday's 100-plus published tuesday morning. the sharpest disagreement appears to be this paragraph in february when trump described ""caravan immigrants"" from mexico as americans. ""you don't build cars at all, that's the problem,"" trump said. ""people like you, who hate the mexican people so much, that they actually don't love their neighbors, that dislike their farmers."" this comment is almost certainly trump's most popular and vilest comment of the year, serving as a recipe for his downfall and leading to a range of other high-profile immigration controversies. here's a head-scratcher that jumps out at us: ""it appears to be the most controversial comment of the year."" ""i still believe in (immigration), not just your religion."" ""i am personally against immigration for 100 years. but if the government took away my choice of supplier to help me pay for my college education, is there more to my religion than that?"" ""i'm deeply offended by 'ethnic cleansing.' that's just not legitimate."" ""my great-grandfather, first mexican american president, took millions of slaves. he's called genocide."" ""if there's one country there are any who are, it's another country."" ""the commonwealth is many people of ethnicity."" there's no much of a back-and-forth about this point, but they appear to be coming at it in different ways. last month, for example, trump said, ""when they come, you know you're going to be destroyed. and there's no merit whatsoever in it."" the single sentence this paragraph addresses so critically is this, which ought to be avoided at all costs: ""many of you are privately religious, but everyone should get along, regardless of their race, but many of you are in love with your neighbors because you have brothers who care about your neighbors. the great pride of your country and your neighbors, regardless of religion, is tremendously important."" the comment above falls short of completely cutting out all of the support for immigration from the faith community that follows with their support. as cnn research shows, a majority of americans are actually against any immigration that can actually exacerbate the already challenging immigration situation in the country. we trust the opinion of this country to provide our country a better tomorrow. we believe that immigration can go a long way towards helping create a society that is more just, that's compassionate and that's grounded in the highest principles. cnn's zeke miller and dave weigel have covered the news with extreme frequency since the start of cnn's critically acclaimed series ""the five,"" which dealt with everything from ice to immigration and its effects on people across the country. zeke miller on cnn's 5 p.m. today: ""where's the agenda?"" dave weigel on cnn's 9 p.m. broadcast: ""all of a sudden they're stressing the issues."" get cnn's 6 p.m. hour on cnn international: ""all of a sudden they're stressing the issues."" get cnn's 7 p.m. hour on cnn international: ""all of a sudden they're stressing the issues."" get cnn's 8 p.m. hour on cnn international: ""all of a sudden they're stressing the issues."" get cnn's 9 p.m. hour on cnn international: ""all of a sudden they're stressing the issues."" get cnn's 9 a.m. hour on cnn international: ""all of a sudden they're stressing the issues."" get cnn's 9 a.m. hour on cnn international: ""all of a sudden they're stressing the issues."" get cnn's 9 a.m. hour on cnn international: ""all of a sudden they're stressing the issues."" get cnn's",grover
813,"Syria crisis: How world should respond (Opinion) syrian president bashar al-assad may not look as spectacular as hundreds of thousands of syrian refugees in the most ravaged parts of the country. he is well beyond the reach of weapons supplies or humanitarian humanitarian assistance. even among these, his regime is clearly confronting hundreds of thousands of enemies – indeed, many new and often great enemies. assad's regime increasingly relies on chemical weapons attacks to suppress its resistance to its very existence. syria's refusal to disarm has brought new threats, namely from iran, as well as from russia, which has been exporting its nuclear arsenal to iran. if syria does not simply arm and assist iran, including through greater military cooperation, the same regime will have enough weapons to stockpile 24.5 mm mortar rounds, all in a matter of minutes, while millions of civilians are forced to make the grim choice between continued use of weaponry, starvation, and the potential to inflict collateral damage by sarin gas. most recently, russia approved an agreement between syria and the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons to deliver more chemical weapons to the united nations that war-ravaged government still denies. the agreement is huge: over 500,000 chemical weapons weapons have been seized in syria for over a decade. that is enough to put civilians on the brink of war for at least a year. there is not an excuse for blocking the implementation of the deal. the assad regime still claims that russia will not allow its poison gas supply to restart, but nato countries such as france, turkey, the united kingdom, and germany have already asserted that they will not allow the delivery of this gas to make any claim on that side of the equation. any confidence in the determination of syria to fight its chemical weapons must be restored immediately. this would enable the arming of syrian rebel forces to gain ground and make life tougher for the syrian regime and its fascist militias. nato has recently joined the campaign to arm the forces of a syrian government that lies in direct opposition to the us-led coalition on the ground. most recently, nato secretary general jens stoltenberg has voiced doubts about arming the assad regime, which led to the most recent escalation of violence in syria. president obama and secretary tillerson are not backing down. syria's detention and addition of at least 14,000 prisoners as part of this campaign are problematic. in addition, syrian forces have arbitrarily detained and tortured dozens of potential recruits. at the end of the special session last year, 84 detainees were reportedly beaten, the guardian reported. though the syrian government denies many allegations, the un criminal investigation suggests there were many more. at least 52,000 syrians have been detained in recent months for alleged rebellion against the assad regime, many of them members of the isil (islamic state of iraq and the levant) militant group. although the opposition refuses to accept it is possible to negotiate the consequences of any agreement. the chemical weapons attack on assad's forces amount to beyond-human-level sabotage; failure to cease production of chemical weapons would be a u.s. stalling (and ultimately, a humanitarian disaster), and western allies would be badly affected by such a move. in time, assad may have a willing ally in this agreement, such as saudi arabia and qatar, which have resisted weapons transfers for a long time. if this country disputes their legitimacy, support for assad becomes a priority. even if those countries did not support what is happening in syria, they would reject the agreement because it would be highly discriminatory toward the country. with russia, iran, and turkey opposed to the agreement, those us, russian, and european allies will have to go after syria's own people because it already remains one of the most oppressive dictatorships in the world. the wider world would suffer if the united states were to impose its laws on those countries, threatening their worth as proxies against them. a democratic and civil society in the middle east requires people who share their values, for example, to do so without fear of terror or assad or their sponsors pulling their levers to advance a regime regime that has been the result of unfair military competition for nearly 60 years. without support from the united states, russia, and the western alliance, assad's regime would be effectively punished for its attacks on civilians, ending in mass killing, and ending the country's legitimacy.",grover
814,"Why can't America have high-speed trains? most people use public transportation for pleasure. but can they afford high-speed trains? they pay almost no tax. the cost of the mass-transit system might be increased, if we had a plan for low-income riders that would be cheaper for folks who don't have the best track and can travel anywhere in america. that's why amtrak and the transbay transit system continue to look skeptically into such a concept. from my perspective, the amtrak model seems like a start. if we envision a way for low-income, job-seeking folks to buy elevated rail tickets and take amtrak trains, the train could meet their needs. most people are already on the roads. train travel isn't nearly as disruptive or convenient as it would be for the very frail, just-less-mobile, upper-class or middle-class. but on the average, rides won't be pleasant. you get involved in and around disruptive, unmotivated snobs. new, cheaper, urban-ready public transportation just isn't on the radar screen of american voters. congressman jack kingston (r-ga.) has long been a champion of a rail-ticket idea, proposing a proposed $60 billion rail ticket system (see his excellent article on rails-to-trails and transit (see page 5 of this section). kingston and his colleagues have yet to finalize a funding proposal for the proposed scheme. we have never had trains — train tickets, say — as transportation or for any other good reason than because people can get to and from work. the price of day-to-day commuters is probably high. but we have not had trains and i don't know what the cost of long-distance traveling might be. many people find rail-ticketing silly and costly, but they know that's not how it should be. for years the cost of travel has been high — it is $170 for 20 minutes or more — but that's just not the skyrocketing price of real life. of course, there's a huge economic, societal, civic and cultural impact of amtrak and the transbay transit system. even in the best of times people are really poor, and government regulation has been appalling. u.s. investments in infrastructure are plagued by insufficient security, lack of proper mapping, poor transit data and poor transportation data. so, why, if we're so keen on rail2.0 and the future of this country, would we sign the paris accord to save american jobs? with the alternative, that is. the only viable route to make this a reality is train tickets for people like me. there are 100+ transit options on the big national plan — including high-speed, all-rail and rural trains — and if we don't include only a low-income, job-seeking race-crawl-only option, that cannot fly. we can. now we can. now this is just a good idea. i think it makes the progressive, the working-class, the public-to-tea-sister-in-heart part of the system much more progressive. of course, when we find ways to reverse public education — and it's the top cause of 21st-century poverty — we might consider ordering lanes of all modes of transport and adding to the gridlocks of roads. most people would be left to wonder if that's how much we should spend money on mass transit if we put our collective voice at the forefront of the debate. but, if a train ticket-ticket idea works, it might make a lot of sense.",grover
815,"The marriage apocalypse may be coming (Opinion) so what is the state of society and the marriage system that is supposed to be more effective as a more confident society? i believe the answer would be good marriage. your marriage system has always needed the same tools as it did at the time you were a young widow. as a stillborn child, you could put your mind to a variety of travails and keep doing what you wanted to do. it was a pleasure to use one's free will to attempt to save yourself, and not for financial gain, but to create bonds based on value and happiness that could continue to allow you to marry in a meaningful and loving way. i don't believe that you can go back to your old ways, but i hope you've learned a valuable lesson in how not to tell a man how you can't marry. and don't give up on the good things in your life that you already have. for example, if he had been divorced, or he lost his job, what type of relationships would you choose to take with you in this day and age? would you give yourself the little moments of happiness that you have already lost, or would you instead take the step of taking a better look? of course you would. if you are writing this, it may not be your fault if it happened to you; i think all those who had the misfortune to hurt others don't know how to get their relationship back. if you did, it was your fault. i know of no model for redefining the marriage system to allow other people to define the freedom they have to live happily together without massive amounts of responsibility for their relationships, and because one's own romance and emotion are just as valuable as one's own potential, you owe it to others to take care of them. it is important to distinguish between the people in these marriages and the ones in the union. you need to look at the gender of each individual as the reason for their independence, because a relationship is not created for every pair but it must always be allowed to function for that individual to have. marriage is also about growth and change in relationships, for one human being is a last resort. you can't ask for an invitation to grow more deeply. you can't bring in so many people to save you. and while i don't think you could simply dismantle marriage, you do have to find ways to make it better for your marriage. but if your marriage is good, how could you let yourself feel unhappy, frustrated, or broke with your spouses? perhaps you chose the more ""normal"" one, the more difficulty you could find in marriage and the additional stress it puts on you, or may not be able to maintain enough tension for you to stay together. how can you provide that stability? but don't let your marriages teach you a lesson. try to find each of those moments where, for some reason, you have to find a way to strike out, only to regret it later. once the bad loves are settled down, the good ones can live happily together for a number of reasons: divorcees get to continue to go to therapy; less children are raised, and you work at attaining them. sometimes you even are willing to cut out your family's ties. is your marriage system the result of a breakdown of communication that is now becoming a rarity? it is tough to endure when our marriages are broken up. not only have you not been able to get along as a couple, but at the same time you have reorganized yourselves to get closer and closer to your goals. all relationships are good. two man/woman marriages are good. but marriage and family relationships are good too. your marriage won't last forever. there will always be ways to manipulate relationships to give you more control, but the best strategy is to recognize that it may not be what you want to see for your marriage or family. and perhaps even sooner.",grover
816,"Without God, life is still meaningful (Opinion) our humanitarian founders included three defining themes within this brave history of humanitarian intervention: the nature of what we do, the desire to teach others, and the final destination. after a particularly eventful decade, our best years were defined by the sublime project of moral imagination: the birth of the human being. in the not-so-distant past the reader was dealt with by the dynamic aspirations and emotions of a child or woman who had fought for their lives for liberty. now we are witness to the wholeness of our vulnerability and the swagger of our courage. i have often been worried about the limits of our commitment to our humanitarian endeavours. it is reassuring to be in the midst of a mission of service to humanity. more than ever a glimpse of our genuine hope for change from these remarkable stories captures our heart. even when we were on this journey, what was most important in our lives was our humanity and that of children. we can remember the saddening grief of this girl, however, to whom there will be little hope. many of the accounts of child soldiers presented changes in our relationship to children. the story of fatima has been challenging to bring to light, as when her father was killed in their country of birth. the mother was not comfortable with the weight of her son but was full of feelings of helplessness that her own mother still found unbearable. the war in iraq showed a desperate side of her daughter. but there was no quick fix for the pain caused by the loss of a child. we saw the suffering in more direct ways. after the disastrous war in iran, there was a renewed and painful focus on the loss of her loved ones in iraq. the clear battle line is still yet to be drawn between iran and iraq. as we eye the future, the caring that is the hallmark of humanitarianism is the hope for the future. this optimism is a release from our pain and our anxiety. the journey to fruition of humanitarianism serves to raise the faithful children. but we must recognize that this journey is also a journey to the survival of humanity. and no matter how difficult the task, there is a home in which all involved can move from crisis to triumph. this is something that one senses when we examine and reflect on the historical and theological truths to come. we recognize that calling for the impossible can help us rebuild from the catastrophe. we see in our eyes, our hearts, our aspirations, our hopes.

817,"Nudity doesn't shock us anymore the audience in paris was treated to our same disjointed response to everything the governments around the world have been shunning for the past decade: nudity. that number was 75% for two moments, and most of us almost exclusively laughed, mostly because of a skewed view of the planet. last week, the french government described a far-right manifesto on attacking islam as an ""extremely offensive misrepresentation"" that attacked the ""of muslims"" and treated muslims as villains. allegations that cartoons mocking islam exist were immediately dismissed by the new french president, jean-marc ayrault, and dozens of leading comedians. some don't support such cartoons, others did, and have denied any responsibility for them. they wanted to promote a second jesus ""to differentiate between evil and good."" after all, we're not trying to radicalize we muslims to paint him as an evil, anti-christ. nudity isn't more important than a repressed, scarred version of what goes on in the mind. most people were probably surprised to learn that in a recent survey the french were remarkably opposed to pornography for adults, nearly as much as turks and italians. the reason for this surprise: male and female nudity was common among french women - the latter a respectable 51% in 2011 compared to 36% at the time of the survey, according to the cartel magazine. ""nudity is a sign of respect and understanding,"" said emma ferrie, a feminist author who first got an interview with a writer 20 years ago called dan hooper, who didn't have any more coming to mind. after an interview with the interviewer, ferrie asked how many children have told them about their childhood nudity, which she explained has grown to include ""designancy, pornography, influence, painting, film installations and more in other ways."" but a 2009 french poll found that french adults are much more likely to believe the disrespect of the religion was significant than that of many other countries. in an interview with the new york times, historian jacques upis disagreed. ""nudity is not really a bad thing,"" he said.

818,"Why more women choose not to marry as transgender women have continued to have a louder voice on their issues – after an outbreak of the first stage of transitioning from male to female, nearly two decades have passed since a new york times article asked readers what a life without regard for gender identity would be like. after fighting on a grandiose dream to ""lose weight without getting hurt,"" kristen morgan, a transgender woman who accepted the de facto term ""male,"" wanted to announce her positive conversion to a trans woman. but then morgan fell for a reality tv reality tv show called ""the color purple,"" which described the impossibly physical transformation morgan would undergo to accommodate one's gender identity. it was a temporary phenomenon, and her conversion story from male to female didn't end well. as a mother of girls, morgan has made some unfortunate mistakes. like admitting her gender identity. like having given up her customary male position at the altar because she was suicidal and when the bible was very angry with her he said, ""your natural body will follow the mistake, but that will be your downfall."" for that, she was beaten, starved, and put on a bone-headed diet. and then her editors at the times implored her to meet their publisher in washington d.c. to meet his publisher, brooke spector. it was an accident, the times reported. here's what morgan said in her defense, according to the telegraph, ""the deceit!"" this side of that. we need to stop losing our support for our girls, our friends, our sexual freedom. we need to stop gaining status, earning status, and avoiding a peer pressure that may make us angry at one another for thinking they can have a knee-jerk reaction. and we need to stop being told we must conform with what the bible says about self-consciousness. we can never deny that we must take extreme forms of parenting. despite the masthead and prominence of those infamous advertisers, the transgender community remains the most aspirational and offensive media plaything in the united states. like hitler's inspiration and the holocaust – they all came from nowhere. about 46% of the population identify with their past gender. the total number of people labeled ""transgender"" comes to just over 50 million. that's about the same as what women make every day on a daily basis in the united states. it's time for the times to let readers know that transgender experiences are not only plausible but sustainable. we can defeat transphobia with a message that is culturally informed. men and women need to go fight for equality without being depicted or spoken about. we need to fight for the same issues women face today without being at odds with them.",grover

""we're going to work that out,"" mcconnell said. ""whatever's needed to reach an agreement, i have spoken to the leader of the democratic leadership."" mcconnell, who is a leading trump critic, is adamantly opposed to increased spending unless tax rates are permanently set at a higher rate. over the last few weeks, he has been frustrated by a lack of progress in key votes by house democrats. the gop tax bill includes tax cuts for many middle-class americans, long an important part of what many democrats say was the economic revival under the trump administration. mcconnell told reporters thursday he could make up with whatever the democratic leadership does and is not looking to negotiate the fiscal cliff tax bill in advance. ""i will keep working with the leadership to get everything done and keep a framework in place,"" he said. that framework includes protections for drivers, farm workers and small business owners, and enforcement of regulatory requirements against corporate fraud, the president announced. reid done for now the senate will take up the spending package later this week and votes on its first time thursday, the s2081. democratic whip dick durbin of illinois said he was confident this would be enough to get a deal to senate democratic leader chuck schumer of new york. but reid ""will definitely not run for reelection, so he will have to keep fighting. i'm in it for the long term,"" he said. democratic sen. ben cardin of maryland said democrats had finally coalesced around a bill now in the hands of schumer and democratic rep. nancy pelosi, d-calif., who introduced it separately in a joint-session session tuesday. ""they have answered that call,"" cardin said. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., conceded that the house would have to work out a deal.

""the head of the cdc had a leadership leadership team in the cdc that was overseeing the screening of the disease. that was such a fact-finding group, he made those decisions by himself."" the first three confirmed cases of coronavirus were linked to surgical instruments in older men. together, two of the cases could increase the risk of more cases, minjewski said. in the second case, the same surgeon in an identical age group — a 58-year-old man — was at the third outbreak. the patient was hospitalized and in the hospital, minjewski said. in that case, all six confirmed cases could increase by as much as 12 percent. the cdc can send a team of experts to look for signs of coronavirus. technologies used in diagnosing the illness have been improving, but the agency is still assessing each case, minjewski said. in this case, researchers are replacing the electronic exam with a new system that is close to the original. that means it will have a much greater sense of the risk as well. the cdc will have to provide a list of the cases that are causing new infections and scientists will have more time to identify those who are at risk. the high level of concern about coronavirus exposure is coming from institutions with access to imaging equipment, munjournik adah, the head of the cdc's occupational safety and health section, said in an email interview. earlier this year, the cdc released results of a preliminary study that found in excess of 10 million people worldwide had a condition called coronavirus, according to the centers for disease control and prevention. coronavirus is present in more than 40% of the world's human population, according to the centers for disease control and prevention. the u.s. is one of two countries that don't have testing systems. japan had also made mistakes, but it had no elaborate system of screening. us screening machines are sensitive enough to detect a single pathogen, and they can detect organisms anywhere. for an infection like coronavirus, a person can swallow three doses of the drug yasapide and be swallowed for a couple of days.",grover
830,"China Spins Tale That the U.S. Army Started the Coronavirus Epidemic the vicious snake ate from the mouths of 70% of china's 97 million people. and that enemy is the u.s. army, who, after all, known for fending off its own warlords and keeping them safe. what's wrong with that??? well, you might want to think about this a little more carefully. actually, what's going on there is, we've had six months in which no one has ever detected the bacterial, my favorite bacteria, which is the cause of the gastrointestinal illness which is the stomach ulcer, food poisoning and infection. but what really has to worry american defense contractors and farmers who work around the clock at night as the combat operation has started in the philippines and thai governments send the employees off every night to oversee an end to the 1,500,000-person u.s. presence in those countries because the special forces commanders in those countries say the area ""involves them,"" but that they know nothing about it. and americans, as expected, get right to the story. new york times columnist and former director of the center for a new american security michael rubin let his colleagues at the democratic national committee know that u.s. troops were actually being sent to fight in the mekong war earlier this year. he said it was because the military brass wanted to show how anti-american it would be, that they wanted to show how allied they could be and that the enemy wasn't happy when troops would be sending overseas to fight while they were in u.s. africa. this happened in the vietnam war, which began in 1975 and included a 65-foot swishment anchored by a swift tiger the size of two footballs. and while it has lasted, the current u.s. commander in vietnam, general james cartwright, is projected to become the first u.s. commander of americans troops in asia. it's where u.s. units should be stationed as soon as military leadership in iraq decides to take it over. but that's not why this has happened. the chinese ruling party in china, consisting largely of lawyers and businessmen, do not recognize the religious and secular core principle of the communist party, which aims to destroy the country and its leadership. a lot of what they do in china is pitiful. but the chinese government, and its party, knows about the vast quantity of evidence that americans are eating human food for only the cause of the plague and that the disease is a worldwide problem and there has been no revolutionary modernization and significant change. that shows just how seriously the chinese party is taking the u.s. military. it is a class war, therefore. most recently, republicans accused the democratic congress of being even more anti-american than the republican-led congress in the late 1980s, when anti-communist hatred raged in the 1990s. then president bill clinton helped create the huge military alliance between the u.s. and russia. at last count, 301.5 million american troops were in china, and 5,700 tanks, 616 aircraft and 482,400 civilian vessels had arrived in and out of china. the chinese military and industrial complex, as well as the combined military manufacturing capability in china, is 15 times bigger than those in the united states. or consider the fact that the americans got a boost when the chinese communist party, u.s. military officials and scientists, notably have found something damning in a handful of seriously published studies. they also claim that this war began by protecting the central military commission, which controls the ruling communist party. this is not the first time political scientists in china have come to so-called pro-china positions. a study on anti-chinese sentiment by richard dennis in his book ""pandora's box"" (the american century) and peter roskam in his book ""the fifth estate: china's leftovers"" (the american century) documented this totally wrong-headed behavior. the people in china have not become anti-free trade advocates, and while they are rich and powerful, they have full support from influential businessmen who aren't the communist party members who are supposed to be the apex figure in their government. meanwhile, for years, ordinary chinese have known that they didn't get the u.s. and that they are only enjoying themselves with jobs and company.",grover
831,"Trump Falsely Tries to Tie Obama to C.D.C.âs âInadequateâ Testing System by tom martin, cnn (cnn) - president donald trump doubled down monday with claims that he is an outlier and true that c.d.c. didn't need the small department of transportation (dot) that's on its books, under the washington congestion train project. ""after months of defending the d.c. commuter rail project, president trump has now made some disparaging remarks to the federal government about the way this project has been done,"" said michelle schofield, assistant assistant secretary for homeland security. trump ""did not mention that the d.c. subway project was fully and properly tested,"" schofield told cnn on monday. following more than six years of delays caused by the construction of trump's namesake project, trump on friday made news of public criticism for the design and construction process by the us department of transportation that was created under the obama administration. new delays in the project, overseen by dot by ryan white, led white to ""cross state lines and did not add a better train system to the nation's transportation system than either federal agency,"" white told a congressional hearing last month. however, white also told lawmakers last week that the d.c. subway project was totally scrapped because of this and that trump ""didn't make it up as it was known."" white's remarks come during the monday hearing on a transportation department hearing hosted by representative brian higgins, the ranking democrat on the house subcommittee on appropriations, subcommittee chairs, and chairs of the subcommittee that oversees c.d.c. the hearing was hosted by sens. john barrasso (r-wyo.), jon tester (d-mont.) and patrick leahy (d-vt.). the event was held at the capitol. d.c. transit commission has received a total of $7.6 billion in federal funding from the federal transit administration, which is the subject of several congressional inquiries, according to the department of transportation website. the d.c. subway project was developed by transport for america, which is a publicly-owned company with extensive federal power. swinging the lowest period ridership, the peak of public patronage in washington, d.c., when up to 10,000 subway ridership an hour were added in july 2011, amtrak responded with some $710 million to build eight large, high-tech commuter rail lines. that's almost 40% of what's needed in d.c. the project was proposed on the heels of a worldwide ""flash"" train acceleration scandal in which one train was involved and the other was heavily damaged. this year's d.c. subway project spans more than 10-dozen miles, and ridership rose 33% in 2012 and 40% this year, according to the d.c. pace institute, which did research on the project. passenger count has jumped by roughly 24% for the largest general fare increases and 54% for major industry trains to the average rate of $77 a week. but despite that, white's comment by friday that the construction should have included more infrastructure planning could have put d.c. in harm's way. a section of the atrium at triton center in washington city's design district that once used to be used as an event center for trump tower opened monday. officials say the project was designed ""to enhance the visitor experience of the port of d.c. and further enhance this region."" the most notable renovation in the new center is the new project's iconic bronze concourse with grand staircases, escalators and light fixtures. copyright 2019 by cnn newsource. all rights reserved. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.",grover

835,"News Quiz: Coronavirus, Joe Biden, Oil Prices this week's edition of ""how badly do you know your oil prices?"" asks mine on an oil rig. the answer may be half-truths, lies and overdoing the government's risk assessment of facts. transportation is a major concern for a number of reasons. the virginia institute of marine sciences developed a sophisticated online web site to monitor oil shipments by the thousands, a project which is estimated to save at least $250 million annually. the latest power bill arrived and in about a minute it marked the largest such blackout in u.s. history. mr. biden ranked no. 24 among the nation's 100 most expensive individuals in the 2017 american opportunity awards. the visit was previously reported by the ap. as for joe biden, the newspaper decided to put him at no. 24. that was the only explanation bexley says his father told him in the 1960s: ""i know joe biden. i am certain that joe biden and the whole joe biden family knows who his father is, and that man is joe biden."" as for the republican party, joe biden's pick for vice president has some mugs. ""not a bad scenario. anyway, i know what i need to know,"" he brags. the intelligence provided by the ""macroeconomic consultant"" made us laugh and cry. the most recent prediction of how much oil the u.s. produces, and how much it costs the government, is by dave weigel. the result is: 22 billion barrels of oil– enough to fill the gulf for 42 years. goldman sachs is the latest stock to rebound from the depths of its 2008 crisis. it closed at $68.44 on wednesday and was up 22 percent since closing lower tuesday. the money and loans have to be repaid. billions of dollars have already been put into the banks at a time when they are feeling short-changed, but not yet ready to repay them. the obama administration and other industrialized nations have benefited handsomely from the oil boom. the result of that has been a surge in global oil prices that has lowered u.s. crude stocks by about half–15 million barrels–and has stripped foreign refiners of their western brands. the latest drop is happening in spite of the white house's argument that the rig blowout was not caused by either a malfunction or other circumstance. james r. brady, a petroleum economist at the university of california, berkeley, said the north american tumble over the past two weeks is no indication that a whole lot of oil is being moved in the gulf. he said the blowout, which involved a production line dead point, linked a petroleum-industry fault to demand for future oil. ""as the depth of the spill appears to be getting nearer to the top of the gulf, some of the higher-profile offshore oil development by different operators over the past year is beginning to be beginning to bear fruit,"" he said. about 3 million barrels of crude oil are about to be moved from the gulf to the u.s. since it sank back to the surface, u.s. oil production has decreased but crude remains about 40 percent below the original production level. but with colder weather moving in, oil prices appear close to where they were last year. biden earns a reputation as someone who won over people at public hearings in 2005, and then rose further in 2008. he briefly gave an interview in 2008 that raised questions about his understanding of politics. then came a guest appearance in 2009 in which he complimented an interviewer, bill o'reilly, of ""the o'reilly factor."" he has in the past refused to answer a question about hillary clinton or her sexual encounter with a woman named monica lewinsky–in other words, he thinks it was a terrible idea. he is a man who speaks out on important issues and has not hesitated to make controversial statements on a personal level. he has threatened to launch a new presidential campaign if elected.",grover
836,"Pentagon Asks to Reconsider Awarding Huge Cloud Contract to Amazon the pentagon on thursday encouraged the u.s. government to reassess its awarding of a big new defence contract to amazon web services on the basis of the agreement's ""end-to-end impact."" the order, which specifies that the contract can be assessed both vertically and horizontally, applies to total cost incurred in delivering and maintaining amazon's cloud services. also in the order, the defense department said it is transferring the contract to lockheed martin corp. the contract was awarded to aws by the army and was valued at about $1.9 billion. a total of $1.9 billion was being allocated to follow-on contracts, mostly for developing infrastructure-as-a-service (esv) units to be launched in 2020 and in 2025. while aws isn't seen as an inherently bad choice for the pentagon to award the contract to amazon, it could set up bad precedent if its importance is put off until 2023. in 2018, for example, the pentagon awarded another $733 million in contracts to lockheed, according to a pentagon release. the order requires the defense department to certify that the contracts have ""complete access"" to the product or services it chose, the army and lockheed said. the number of instances of subcontracting is limited by the size of the contracts; as of mid-december, the defense department submitted just 27 instances of such activity. the white house put the number at 457. in a statement on thursday, the pentagon said its ""regulatory bodies and institutions"" are working to improve disclosure and practices that allow transparency. ""the department's watchdog bodies make major efforts to ensure the highest standards of delivery,"" the statement said. ""these efforts range from using our standard information accounting system to ensuring our agencies have the data and information they need to implement security and technology risks protections."" while the pentagon has requested internal reviews, it only received a partial order in september that ordered some kinds of share construction, with the federal government confirming with that order that request had been granted. pentagon orders those with an open start-up award under the process must follow specific contracting requirements, including not less than two months after the program is awarded, to be eligible for a variety of awards. one drawback is that the process is designed to award just one or even two deals at a time. it should produce clear analysis on the technology issues affecting the previous deal, but it is not yet clear if that happened. facing a lawsuit from u.s. district judge william alsup in georgia, the defense department sought to put the decision under seal and said the case would be sent to the 9th circuit appeals court. the defense department has asked for a trial date, so it is unclear how fast the appeals court can rule. yet this is highly unusual from a communications perspective. it looks like the pentagon has been putting little effort into nonpublicly updating its own record before the 9th circuit has had its own investigation into amazon. it also rewrote its regulations and provisions to create a less-secretarialarial panel capable of independent oversight over contracts awarded by various department. so even though it is yet unclear what the hearing on the case will be, flynn has already signaled that he's been monitoring amazon's bids carefully. amazon has aggressively sought a higher award, making deals with the department of homeland security, for example, and in practice given a price tag of $750 million. amazon officials have indicated, however, that the asking price for the aws contract would be ""significant.""",grover

850,"30 Recipes for Lunch at Home as over a hundred american families are preparing their lunchtimes, it's no wonder that a single family has been forced to be home more than most are able to cook. at last count, about one in four families (1 in 3) with around 300 or more children aged 10 and older had some sort of food assistance program approved by the usda. so without them, i think, the meal planning was not as well thought out as it would have been. here are 30 simple recipes for lunch at home that are the perfect summation of meal planning and food choices. 1. ask me a few questions when shopping for healthy meals at home. i would ask, ""are you ready to exchange any recipes you are getting for your own meals?"" i would ask that kind of intrusive questions. i would ask, ""do you have the time to prepare your meals? give me what you need to prepare the food."" (then, with the last word in order, request the vegetables and the potatoes.) (now, i'd thank the ""grandma."" now, i'd thank the ""mom."" there's nothing wrong with ""grandma."" i've got 'em.) 2. plan for gifts. one of the first things i would ask as a family are, ""when should i give gifts to a relative?"" (using the ""n"" term it comes from a mother you've struggled with saying, ""when does it really matter? how much is my child important to me?"" at least once, since i was the only mother to have some grandchildren?) (this makes two for me.) (i'm mom, now. at least you'll know about it.) 3. reassess what i expect at a budget-friendly lunch. if your family's budget is maxed out, make adjustments: such as cooking in the fridge for your children; dining at all friends' houses for dinner; taking a side trip; or doing the homework. so what? what if the entire family ends up helping out? how about looking into what other things you do in the house or on your block, and what meals to cook for your family (or perhaps every other evening?). the budget is inclusive, and is best written down for each family to anticipate as to what needs to be done. 4. opt for fruits and vegetables and/or whole grains, and eat vegetables and/or whole grains and/or whole grains daily. i'll tell you what my food budget is for brunch at a restaurant, plus, i'm not sure where a few dollars went. my same-oldfood debacle with uncle toby and ""those three peas."" (it's not optional.) 5. buy white, beige, light gray, or pink cereals and whole grains at all market places. it's perfect for lunch on the sunday before school starts or sunday night to avoid the food choices. and are at least breakfast cereals, whole grains, or quinoa, and eating every day. it's delicious, nutritious, and affordable. 6. save produce at home. help was always a no-brainer for us but a no-brainer for many of our family-planning and food preparation committees. one helpful suggestion: provide fruit and vegetables. 7. if you make the usual sized choices of large goods, says cake, coleslaw, cheese, and so on, please identify what you can afford to buy in your budget. this isn't a recipe for being ready to know what you need at a budget-friendly lunch. instead, it's a guideline for your own next meal and not for some families without a budget. perhaps you will want to pick off the few foods that are made especially for your family. instead, if all else fails, start with the foods you already have and plan out what you will buy for that day. this includes potatoes, cauliflower, mint, and kale. what a classic how i'm sure many people have forgotten, but how fresh cornflakes are and can be purchased for less than $1. 8. buy a cappuccino with fruit! i recommend that people not buy cappuccinos in the supermarket (which isn't always a good thing). i'm sure most of my siblings and nieces come home empty-handed when they need cappuccinos and teas (i see my nieces and nieces with so much eating). so feel free to bring on some cappuccinos in the lunchroom.",grover

858,"Fears Rise for World Leaders as Officials Test Positive for Virus rio de janeiro (cnn) — sanctions on the toxin sturgeon cod are being tested at the federal centers for disease control and prevention for a second time, cnn affiliate hln reported friday. the swim bug caused sickening havoc among sick people around the world in an attempt to demonstrate its ability to spread quickly and easily. experts said that although tuesday's testing was inconclusive — but that more tests could come as the week progresses — it was a significant step toward reversing the effects of the waterborne illness, which has killed up to 20,000 people worldwide since the 1960s. experts note that the deaths rate is likely to decline over the next decade as older people are vaccinated and the flu wears off. the world health organization predicts that countries with a 20 percent mortality rate in the 2020s will have a 17 percent rate this year, as they try to catch the illness early and prevent it. while the mosquito known as b. entrails cannot transmit the virus from person to person, if a larger number of people in the country has exposure, the mosquito's biomass increases with age, and it likely poses a primary risk to the population, cdc officials said. ""it is important to remember that if a b. entrailer bites someone, they are likely to show early signs of disease,"" dr. christina meisler, the cdc's associate director of public health, said in a statement. ""it can be even easier to get a bite from a b. entrailer, especially if the fish contains a sample of a specific species of b. entrailer."" more than 400 people have died in 24 countries since thursday, including fatalities in cambodia, guinea, algeria, mauritania, namibia, and angola. b. entrails — commonly found in warm climes and in the wild — are a favorite method of getting fish the way they had to, researchers said. ""i don't have any fear that people will spread the infection,"" said dr. charles hawk, a virologist at vanderbilt university in nashville. ""i have no suspicions that those people will."" fisheries groups and scientists are trying to iron out much of the mystery surrounding the disease. agencies serving the drug treatment kavalaid are testing the human population of an altered species of cod — but no one knows exactly which species are under threat. while officials are expected to announce further testing in the coming weeks, much of the focus has been on what happened last week, when a report from the cdc said that a bay-like organism called infernos mosquito known as kawoquidus (xlna3) was responsible for the 10.3 million cases in the united states that have resulted in at least 108 deaths so far this year. the disease, which can cause serious and life-threatening birth defects, has been spreading through coastal states, farming communities and urban centers, according to the cdc. kawoquidus was linked to the disease after a survey of 2,000 people conducted by duke university's hazard foundation found widespread contamination of the millions of lab-lab samples from the sturgeon population. meanwhile, biologists said it was possible to create a biota — an organism that in some ways resembles a fish embryo. ""any organism that grows, damages and kills a person is a bit odd,"" said dr. mark w. leavitt, the cdc's associate director for infectious diseases. ""but the fact that people couldn't get the organism alive in the aquatic environment and not die is a good indicator that it is a new class of organism."" lavitt, who was not involved in the cdc's three-year study on the disease, said the bacteria is known to live in north america and was absent in tropical and southern asia as a result of a spring storm that made the area uninhabitable. dr. benjamin g. frey, a virologist at howard hughes medical institute in new york, said that the exact cause of the long-term disruption in both ecosystems remains unknown, but said he suspects the parasites may have struck the sediment in the riverbed as b. entrails were sedated and grown in the deeper sediment to produce an infection that took hold in early spring. according to the cdc, b. entrails cannot transmit the virus to humans or animals through these methods. ""these organisms don't turn into death, but they do reproduce before it gets to humans,"" said frey. ""people don't think it's going to",grover

""we have the physical presence of this virus that brought it to the city of new york,"" said dr. gary gerstein, an infectious diseases epidemiologist at the centers for disease control and prevention. but sometimes, the virus spreads beyond cities into the county that feeds the virus. and in 2005, an offshoot virus that was three times as common last year was traced back to the second largest city in new york. ""although the proximity to the second largest city in the country makes it difficult to fully identify what's going on, we believe that it is a community of virus that's in the same line of distance from population centers to be there and grow,"" gerstein said. the same virus developed ""systems"" to spread the virus through people who visit the infected area, often when people who eat in a public place aren't 100% vaccinated, gerstein said. the viruses may get out in droves and spread more easily. ""these families that you are talking about are the same family of virus,"" he said. in 2003, people near the top of the pyramid — excluding children — was considered rare. people who don't have superpowers. since then, the shares of the leading city aids outbreak began dropping. people nationwide were not immune to the virus. and if new york city and other urban areas fell in the middle of the flu pandemic, more people would lose immune status, the cdc said.

(no, you don't). if you assume a place is safe, you might prefer not to travel with someone who has been passed over for safety. several people have been done death by eating what you found. but, assuming their health has been contaminated, you might want to call them up and have them checked. or you might be willing to take their contaminated food in return for a promise that if they return to the same road they use to travel – call up a local doctor. once they have been assured safe, even strangers could make the same claim. if they shared their visit with at least one doctor, that doctor could then help them decide what will happen if they return to the same roads they used when they met that doctor. 2. travel? cancer and your body's response to drugs? physical activity is an important thing. it accounts for 60 percent of overall wellness. it gives you breathing capacity. (you may be able to fall off your bicycle, onto the floor, or even limp over to a pool of water.) but what if your body shrinks or your heart muscle contract? that can expose you to more complex health issues – like infections, hepatitis, and colorectal cancer. 3. avoid travel: expenses make travel expensive. most factors should be considered, such as security, tax, insurance, car rental companies, alcoholic beverages, and the like. you should go to a major hotel or convention center that supports tourism and does not require chemical handling, so that you have flexibility to travel at all hours of the day and night. you could not eat lunch in downtown washington, d.c., and you would have no home or office. 4. disruption: what do you do if you encounter unexpected, slow movement? you could use an airport on an organized basis. even if you did not have accommodations, keep your bag ready at all times. or turn your car over to a fresh car-departure hotel and wait for it to arrive. 5. for the sick: the symptoms are serious. like thirst, sore throat, chest or stomach, or diarrhea. when are you in a place that is officially listed as being unsafe? if they list you as a confirmed case of cancer, it is likely you are at risk for viral diarrhea and anemia. you might be, for example, susceptible to hepatitis, in which those infected can have a fever or cough for a few weeks or months. you might even lose you liver, literally. when symptoms are more severe, you might experience nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. then you may have a fever or burst of red blood cells. even if you have mild to moderate fatigue, you may experience bouts of dizziness, vomiting, swelling, and convulsions. the symptoms and the severity of the illness can be very serious for many people, but it's critical to seek medical attention for these people if they have serious side effects. see a doctor if you experience some of these symptoms.",grover

867,"Opinion | The Pandemic vs. The President editor's note: since president trump has taken office, his administration has promoted a new national government policy with over 300 policies and plans. the state of the union address, 2017 was called ""the unexpected job creation act of 2017,"" which is now president-elect trump's biggest priority, promising that as much as 30,000 jobs will be created every year. last month, the director of the center for american progress was on record as saying, ""as we remain focused on job creation and keeping jobs up, we have an enormous amount of unfinished business -- the debt limit and the tax cuts. with each passing minute, more work remains to be done to create thousands of new jobs."" i am frequently turned on by the pre-meditated paralysis in congress, the hostility in the white house and i'm appalled by the policies and programs being fought for. we all expect leaders will, and we will. but to be distracted by this ruse of ideas is not an objective reflection of the direction of the country, nor is it a first step towards solutions, nor a cause to begin to heal a nation. the situation facing congress today is a different and much more complex, yet equally dangerous situation. the shutdown has forced congress to put two pieces of paper that none of us could have imagined these past days -- and that leaves us with a vote on the debt limit and the dream act to prevent federal deficits from spiraling out of control. the district of california has the third highest rate of youth unemployment in the country -- with 22,500 children living in foster care, the highest rate in the u.s. -- and just 25% of the working adults there are employed or looking for a job. a report released last month from the center for american progress said the dream act may allow 800,000 undocumented undocumented students to complete their education while deferring student loans for up to 30 years. but while 40% of those daca recipients will have their student loans repaid, it would also save them $900 million dollars per year. this bill would also create $3 billion in private school scholarships -- and there are more that could be made available than meets the bill's standards for funding essential services. the u.s. capitol has been haunted by immigration actions over the past two days. this is not the first time that the u.s. capitol has become a battleground, when it was immersed in a partisan fight between the president and house speaker paul ryan, fighting over american policies on both sides of the aisle, and limited and worrying spending on the president's two most important domestic priorities: social security and immigration. and the biggest dangers for the trump presidency come from president barack obama's actions during the height of the financial crisis. republicans controlled the house and senate since 2007. the presidents and their cabinet, majority leader mitch mcconnell and his staff, faced off over nearly every issue facing their respective parties at the critical issue: immigration. lawmakers passed a bill in 2016, for example, that followed a law on illegal entry by illegal immigrants and allowed those entering the country without authorization to stay for two years. all too often the obama administration made it clear that, while it allowed more than 1.6 million to enter the country illegally, it prohibited them from doing so for 30 years or longer, effectively leaving them with nowhere to stay. the federal government was also complicit in allowing the many millions of illegals to enter the country illegally, breaking the law even after numerous legal challenges to the entry of these individuals. by reversing this law, the obama administration ensured that, through legal loopholes and the internment of thousands of people, nearly 700,000 people have simply disappeared from our homeland -- ending in the exodus from our nation. my children are too young to know what that means, and fear that this will soon be the end of the white house. but as president trump has shown us -- it is not all bad news for a country -- it is not all bad news for a nation. and when there is less cooperation across the aisle, it becomes even more difficult to understand the divisions on national issues. finally, people must also be reminded that fighting on the battlefield is one of the most difficult facets of creating a society. this never-ending battle for the country is not over. and the situation is changing daily at the very touch of capitol hill. the fight for the nation can only get started if congress does its job, prioritizing bipartisanship above fights. congress needs to pull together and show republicans and democrats that we are on the right track. at the national level, congress should not be defeated on the political battlefield, not the president.",grover

""in the face of headwinds in congress, republicans have decided to vote 'no' on policymaking as best they can,"" he wrote. david bauder, paul ryan's press secretary, quickly followed with a rebuttal. ""republicans are divided by tradition on issues and by instinct,"" bauder wrote.

""there's absolutely no doubt that we're going to have an extremely tough conversation about this issue in terms of it being exempt and this effect our kind of local governments will have on us and also the state of louisiana,"" watson told cnn. the risk posed by an outbreak of mesenchymal dysplasia has been described by officials as the ""near-by"" complication of a disease called plasma fumigation. ""we've seen this in past. part of this seems to be a third-party designation,"" said greg gamble, the louisiana department of human services deputy administrator. gamble added, ""in a time like this where there is a lot of questions that need to be answered is there have to be other options. if a location like new orleans is the location that many of these patients are going to be the caregivers, and all those out there are going to need some financial help, then we need to be very cautious."" the mississippi department of human services acted on alabama's request to stay some of the flood-displaced facilities open after it removed the extra staffing. hds told cnn in an email that its officials hoped an outbreak of the disease would reduce the number of clinics and make up for its temporary assistance. ""due to a number of high-profile individuals not coming forward to speak out concerning this issue in our state, now may be the best time to consider closing any abortion clinics in our state,"" hds said. whether or not the state will do so, louisiana's continued closure of abortion clinics leaves a lot of red tape. in addition to closing clinics, the louisiana legislature is considering laws that would allow physicians to refer patients to clinics with no anti-abortion content, as well as require clinics to guarantee a zero tolerance on anti-abortion abuses. these these kinds of issues can raise and hide the head-on effects of these millions of dollars in health care bills that louisiana and the district of columbia face every year, and which louisiana could face just for the very first time as a result of this man's actions. and louisiana is likely the only place in the united states to allow the medical export of pro-abortion pro-life action as an excuse to assault women's health rights. so why is such a horribly wrong decision?",grover

""man of la mancha"" is a period piece, and when his wife, annie, gets ""a report"" at his home, she notices that the collection isn't just about him. she is a living legend, a ""poisonous dictator,"" who she nevertheless believed to herself to be smart, funny, and capable of undermining the government – a devious and abhorrent feminizer with a murderer's head, donning the high-heeled shoes of albino monty python and taking her heritage seriously. not only is annie the film's lovable, laconic protagonist – annie has only agreed to marry her dad, who turns out to be a slaughter-machine – she is also her husband's mistress, a heroine who gets more personal in his descent into madness than she realizes. annie kind and funny how else can annie illuminate the private life of william, her maid of honor who confides in her about her strange past? in the book, and in an art direction display where annie might just surface in a moment, annie lets the reader click through to some of william's grievances. the story uses annie as a victim, letting the reader know what more she can ask of william about his familial love for his butler. some of these actions are actions that only leroy would have pursued: being a child and friends, forging a relationship, dating and dying, sleeping with a friend – something many people are struggling with – and kissing into someone she loves. the twists and turns of characters quickly convey the slithery, looking maternal disposition of the story. and it's not just children who carry the blame for this. john waters' earlier musical works, including ""the lion king,"" and ""west side story,"" have not been able to evoke the drab façade of human-ness of ""man of la mancha."" the more the story stays true to the theme of innocence and meaning in fact, the more involved william is in his action. but richard rabin, former editor of the new yorker and author of ""twin shadow: the genius of romantic theatre,"" calls it another betrayal of the kind that the schlosser implicitly acknowledged, or drew the most ire from the critics. and it is one of the reasons why the critics do not want to take them seriously.",grover

878,"The Weekly | Meet the Woman Who Outsmarted Boko Haram from an unfortunate bag of information, the foreign office has acknowledged that brexit news was a miscarriage of justice. it was an image that we now hold unconnected to the facts of the ground realities in turkey, egypt, syria and nigeria. through a deceitful and messy lens of judging the merits of their jealously, they and their failed policy in yemen, cameroon, iraq, sierra leone, somalia, sudan, congo, nepal, syria, pakistan, afghanistan, palestine, the central african republic, somalia, mali, central african republic, cameroon, niger, malawi, angola, eritrea, zimbabwe, rwanda, kenya, congo, nigeria and yemen. the worst mistake of the state department is not preventing violence in north africa, nigeria, egypt, cameroon, mali, sierra leone, pakistan, kenya, congo, nigeria and yemen. the state department's mishandling of the general debate in uganda after a cabinet meeting was probably in part due to embarrassing revelations about how the u.s. mishandled africa's crises. far from being an international best-practice, some government agencies had no need to deal with these problems before they took the helm. it was for these agencies what was in store that the u.s. would alter its policy. it was for the state department and the bank of england to denounce market value over ""rate-of-return,"" which implies that true, unattainable or result-less data on bank lending do not correspond with the best rates of return. that policy decisions would evolve based on the support provided by the rates of return for ""opportunities to buy"" or ""options to upgrade our investment portfolio"" was not new to any government. the resulting loss of duty data for the following agencies was painful. the united states authorities had apparently spent 200 million dollars on the following items. the decision, as it happens, to appoint these additional persons was needless and exploitative. its strategy, however, was to allow the united states to unilaterally replace the countries in that crisis. this was a dangerous strategy to introduce additional fraud and abuse in the results of foreign policy. we, the bureau of state department, were really to be congratulated for serious work that was undertaken on the basis of moral responsibility to those responsible for failing to do what was in the best interests of the american people. as everyone knows, this was the way to screw up the u.s. electoral process and push the american people to shut out major foreign officials from election day in order to try to please the country's moderate islamist leadership. yet the state department let this hold true. with so many headaches to choose from in the electoral process, the attempt was to bend or not bend to the government's pressures to preserve the status quo in order to further saudi interests and projects it wanted to control. the children of the naïve at national security agency became victims. although the russian federation, during the time of al-qaeda's first takeover of afghanistan (1991), was a the future president of the united states and fought to maintain political control over congress, it had been followed by the russian federation. it made more sense that in this case, the process should have been reversed, ostensibly, to safeguard us interests, but against criticism from russian officials. the result was a repeat of the 1988 election vote that russia planned to use against president reagan. thus, hundreds of thousands of voters had been excluded from the election and those who voted were not american citizens. properly maintaining it did not require changing the election code. however, it did requireholding state resources solely to protect america, its constituencies, and candidates. that means continued waste of time trying to tamper with the electoral process. as to this other endangerment, that is because the fraud, manipulation and abuse launched by the state department, concerned over the ""price"" of the two-week long mission in south africa, reflected an absence of u.s. values at a time when washington's policy was escalating the wars in afghanistan and iraq and oman. although it was a mistake to abandon south africa, president karzai of afghanistan, would not end up voting. he does not need any form of electoral reform, governance and elections to govern. in order to restore a political environment to reinvigorate the rule of law and stability, some elected officials have been removed from office. polling in south africa is being conducted that is at an all-time low. this outcome was the result of the influence exerted by the administration of donald trump, who usually uses the term ""mullahbayevism."" there should be no love lost between the media and its readers. there is no scope for",grover
879,"Opinion | How to Fix the Coronavirus Testing Mess in 7 Days if you ever thought about getting all the due diligence you need before developing a test kit for a person at large, then you're going to be amazed when i arrive in a guest house—after two days of treatment and no problems—with nothing out of the ordinary. i'm a rookie program manager on a most famous government contract for a company called research and development canada, and this past week my third visit to the clinic. i was most likely wrong to think that r&d canada might have an obligation to i, nor should they, to offer prospective test subjects. but the hype has circulated. r&d canada definitely has the upper hand in the testing work out there in the us, especially with a $62.3 million first round of test tubes that were designed to test specific mutations in p6 proteins. once it was decided, r&d canada could test roughly 15,000 p6 proteins for testing purposes in the country. not to be outdone by research and development canada, i found a plane ticket to arizona to take the test kits home and one of those tickets was an only-in-last-series after-hours appointment at the arizona state hospital. so did not i say ""surprise""? well, yes. i had difficulty with fly-fishing and possibly was left bleeding profusely in the back of my head after a 5 kilometre run when my flight attendants came to the door, ordered me to fly quickly and then covered me with a bucket of water and ordered my flight attendant to go. i was dropped off, and made to wait for two minutes for service. luckily, my flight attendant arrived at the medical examination center shortly after that, so we had good reason to expect a quick examination. i pulled the huge bucket off my throat, ate a few bites and felt no ill. after that, i actually had a bit of tenderness (like i would have had under the category of ""human""). i thought it was supposed to be my day, but then came the next morning when the blood-sugar levels were level with just 12 or 13 ng/ml. i marveled that even on the table prior to treatment or to my test of 15 pesticides with two measures were down to a trivial five ng/ml. i opened the box and watched as the grapefruit fly slowed down again. at the last minute, i realized that, with a slightly lower than normal level of snoring, i got the chance to dig a little deeper into my bag. my flight attendant, this time a diehard r&d canada fan, insisted that i return to the clinic, so i put my receipts on the chair. she relayed the details of my main issues. for some reason, she didn't have any answers to my questions. this is how it works: she used a personal pronouns that reflect her thinking or to dramatize why she found me too toxic to trust. and she was right. when i went in, i gave her a clean ""yellow xer"" from the yellow worm test tube, and she eventually contacted me about joining her. my needs are good enough to be discharged on an appointment and the results don't disappoint. did i make the right choice? in any event, no. most importantly, whatever i was sent to, it worked in a positive way. no longer were i on fumes and suffering from sinusitis. no longer were the cases my tests revealed rampant. i made it three days to have my test tube removed, and that is a miracle even if it wasn't possible to do. so yeah, right off the bat, if you keep ticking over from one point of view and you act like i didn't care to care about you, chances are you can expect to take a couple more days to move on. once you find out you have a good test kit, use it as your key to get through these 3-plus months of on-the-go treatment. the week after you sit down to assess your own asthma and how it might affect you in coming years, you will be better prepared to start your own treatment with a minor diversion. get it done—one week at a time.",grover
880,"Opinion | How to Fix the Coronavirus Testing Mess in 7 Days it's hard to believe that thursday morning, april 4, 1984, may have set such a different standard for the technology that makes and supports testing for viruses. while this was undoubtedly good news to the mother of virus testers, health professionals over the years have never fully understood the severity of the disease and how to address it. shall we turn a new leaf and use the new definitions? to paraphrase the market-leading testing labs of the early 1980s, what many people learn is that the test system is not just for individual and shared samples. it's for the whole family, on all levels. and not just diagnostics. it's a test to eliminate viruses, just in case one or more, too. you don't need to know that the virus itself is the cause of everything that's wrong with you. and the facility's data is intended for dissemination by qualified medical personnel, especially doctors, nurses, and social workers. this made perfect sense to several federal and state agencies that are handling the virus test itself. that wasn't the end. biologists, help workers, and law enforcement first gathered information, then began collecting checks to determine the order of importance of each sample. by requiring use of ""crossover"" samples, scientists investigated the origin of the infection and created a model to forecast the sequence of the virus's attacks. even monitoring and processing samples is slow and often inefficient. it was not until about 19 months after the disease spread that scientists managed to establish the date and conditions that propelled the virus into circulation. ""there was no known cause,"" says dr. david higgs, a geneticist at duke university. ""we knew the vector of the disease was being directed through the livestock."" ""we knew there was no shortage of viruses,"" says medical director dr. richard j. neuwirth. ""and we knew there were no epidemics. and we knew there were no outbreaks."" he noted, ""harms to all of us are that we choose to use our expertise to solve our problems. and in some cases, we choose to do it for ourselves."" in 2015, about 200,000 former patients in new york city were vaccinated against meningitis while the virus was in the air. that's equivalent to every day's training for a nurse or doctor's assistant, according to the cdc. and no brand-new $37 million facility was built on the old way. the institute of medicine set a standard for testing, the new york times reported last november. before that, businesses and school districts had to pay ""state, federal and local law enforcement agencies"" to test their own vaccines. that has now vanished. as a result, scientists can no longer address the inadequacies of diagnostic testing. instead, attempts are now made to cover up deficiencies of laboratory work, like the date on a serum test used in several years, and the environment where a virus is discovered. for cancer, tests are not needed to treat it. in many cases, patients on tests may be immunocompromised. ""we've made some really excellent progress,"" says dr. neuwirth. ""we are now one step away from dealing with all the data that the community has over there -- input from all of us and then getting able to drill down into the science in the laboratory to see what the data would show. it would be very useful in terms of getting this data out as quickly as possible."" the kind of testing laboratories that dot our modern society run on a very lean, by-the-book process. more importantly, they often meet all sorts of ethical, technological, and data-driven needs and milestones.",grover

883,"Opinion | How Much Worse the Coronavirus Could Get, in Charts the words ""7-year-old poisoned"" were long forgotten in 1976 when the cdc reported finding cases of an underdeveloped infection of human placenta, a placenta that is a long-dead fetus but still protected against parasites. it is a known culprit, the cdc claims, only in humans, that it is the persba virus, which spread among children as young as infants. the infection is seriously transmitted through contact between the mother and daughter and from there through unprotected vaginal delivery (that's no wonder she found her baby while passing pints of urine). when a woman has contracted herpes simplex virus (phv), it is the most common bacterial infection due to virus replication. to get the disease, doctors typically advise that the woman have antibiotics intravenously. a gay man, who had herpes simplex, is more commonly spread through kissing or vaginal bleeding and transmitted only through nasal discharge (for genital herpes) once it begins to become infected. of course, the cdc's controversy around placenta actually dates back to the early 1900s. numerous similar infections have been diagnosed in u.s. and foreign countries since at least 1980, a 1989 report from the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) confirmed. the cdc has been investigating the spread of their particular infections since 2011. a study published earlier this year by dr. thomas frieden, cdc director, found that 33 percent of the virus strains reported had been observed in organisms related to placenta. it is also very likely that the virus in placenta was contracted indirectly from women infected with the virus, with some even believing the same partners as the pregnant woman using placenta. but cdc officials want people to know that the most common infection was antibiotic resistance. so it is only prudent to keep warning ladies, doctors and friends of the hospital who have lately uncovered the problem when entering their facility. research finds bacteria levels in the intestines and blood of infected people have risen by up to 5.5 percent over the past decade, with few exceptions. in spite of the cdc claims that despite their involvement, placenta infections still occur in children, but about half of the cases in the uk are still reported by parents, according to the british charity known as e-rate. cdc officials insist that people should not get tested until a fuller investigative trail has been launched, but cautioned against fans of the virus. but a recent study published in the american journal of infection and immunity shows that, overall, the virus remains a problem even though there is not enough evidence to determine its exact origin. as a result, research finds that placenta leads to underdeveloped and hard-to-treat infants, such as chinchilla crops in australia or hepatitis b in china. although it is a much-publicized disease, there is little scientific science to explain how the virus gets on people, and it is no secret that health authorities have experienced a fair amount of vaccine misdiagnosis in the past, ever since janet robinson, former assistant director of the cdc's infectious diseases laboratory in denver, placed an order for a government-wide pre-nasal vaccine in 2012. by contrast, scientists have found positive cases in both the u.s. and european europe, but much of the information used to investigate them and to figure out the origin of the diseases is still available on a crowdsourced website developed by a consortium of u.s. physicians focused on the science of placenta infections. placenta infections can be risky and difficult to treat, yet an early vaccine only works in only a small subset of cases, professor tim mann at the stanford school of medicine in california has found. mann proposed a new drug proposed in 2010 to beat the placenta viruses but he got little support from congress. the risk of pneumonia among placenta patients increases almost every day, mann found. and given the virus's low therapeutic effectiveness, its low survival rates and safe dosage for infants, mann decided it was time to take a stand against its epidemiology. eventually, the case was reviewed, and mann then published a paper about placenta infections in the british journal of medicine, the three-volume publication that has authored more than 2,500 papers. a ""once upon a placenta"" study, published in the journal infectious diseases, found that the placenta-associated or placenta virus (plv) is not present in most studies and the studies being conducted in the united states are the only in the united states. although there is no proof that placenta infection rates are higher in women than in men, mann has found",grover

886,"Opinion | Letâs Move Courts Online and Suspend Bail for Nonviolent Offenses as a union attorney, i've observed many cases that have resulted in societal costs for police officers and other law enforcement organizations that harass and lie about the conversations officers have with citizens regarding any law enforcement issue. it is my belief that the cost of the role of an officer in law enforcement is enormous. unfortunately, the cost of defending police officers and other law enforcement entities with violent crimes against us is a part of the price tag. in the cases of randall davis and dayan wright, after the courts ordered them to pay $2,500 in fines, city officials filed suit, asking that their case be dismissed. in 2014, a new york judge ruled that they could remain free pending appeal of the ruling. three years later, in 2016, the court of appeals overturned the sentence against them on a specific charge of resisting arrest. under a ruling by the 9th circuit, a single element of a more serious felony could be used to convict the defendant without his family's permission. under this ruling, no person could be charged without the defendant's consent. this ruling could be applied to any other felony that constitutes a further attack on citizen freedom. advertisement late last month, the washington post reported that president trump was planning a mass deportation of african american males and young latino males who use their phones and digital devices to listen to political speeches. this would be the first time such a radical regulation has been applied to an assault on the civil rights of young black males. while i am appalled by the trump administration's actions, i do not find any evidence that such would constitute a crime or make any difference to the intent of the offending individual. i consider this assault upon civil rights to be an attempt to suppress the right of minorities to be political and political as well as the right of their political representatives to participate in political and political protests. i support all efforts to stop such harassment of peaceful protesters, but those efforts must be monitored thoroughly. they need to be kept in check. but there are dangers ahead. any proposed action to expel immigrant workers is a step toward deporting those who already violate free speech or have not been charged with a crime. almost all the efforts to stop immigrant workers include illegal alien and undocumented mexican immigrants, many of whom do not belong to america. in the new york case, employers informed the supreme court that they faced harassment and intimidation if immigration judges decided that some illegally illegal immigrants were being detained in the detention center. for example, in that case the private business owner informed ice that other business owners were under arrest if any of them tried to cross the u.s.-mexico border. and heeded the ice agent's warning and perked up the situation. in some instances ice attorneys at new york's civil service, convinced that business owners had no right to allow their employees to work on their properties, forced these employees to leave after a polite demonstration to show their solidarity with ice. beyond any consequences for the rights of unlawful immigrants, the legalization of undocumented workers is a further way of empowering law enforcement and restricting violent criminal behavior. if the government cannot function effectively and efficiently in border security, they must be forced to do so. another strategy in restricting civil rights to immigrant workers is to grant the rights of those who move to other countries and have been undocumented and perhaps relocate to identify their rights. i join mayor muriel bowser in condemning the trump administration's threat to ban immigrants from certain lands to the us as part of its ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. i was offered two reasonable alternatives to following trump's unconstitutional attitude to civil rights – if the current leadership of the federal government could at least listen to a diverse and independent public. rather than pursuing immigration reform based on legal reasoning, many chiefs of state law enforcement in the united states are now rejecting the congressional council on unfounded stupidness, an unofficial policy of the council that prohibits the conducting, conducting, conducting, conducting or, ultimately determining, whether or not criminal and legal discrimination may exist in any government authority. mccloy wade is chief of staff for the senate judiciary committee and a justice department attorney. key members of the senate judiciary committee have all said that they support open government and open debate. the human rights campaign strongly supports open government and support the enforcement of laws prohibiting racial discrimination.",grover

891,"Opinion | We Need to Flatten the Curve. Trump and Fox Are Behind It. in the wake of today's press release from fox accusing the network of ""jailing"" donald trump, i asked: how should president trump respond? last week, some analysis suggested that president trump's bombshell interview with cnn's laura ingraham on friday, which is now appearing on-air, could have ""trusted"" further evidence that trump's business associates were behind the attacks. this quickly went from standard to bullish to all-out skeptical, to say the least. in a non-sequitur article published by national review on april 5, january jones of national review condemned the ""naive"" call by trump's press secretary, sarah huckabee sanders, to ""train our troops to track down terrorists."" jones, like other critics, said the assault on the cnn program did not ""appear to be a hate crime"" and called on reporters to ""prepare for a terrorist attack."" trump appears to be taking the same position he did on the first day of the trump era, with clinton still threatening to use twitter to try to hammer the media relentlessly about its heinous strategy against clinton. shortly before tuesday's event, when trump could have been shown with a photograph of clinton on his back, he invoked the tenth amendment in a forum reminiscent of the declaration of independence in which he uttered the words of thomas jefferson, reminding everyone that their countrymen are fighting a war to stop them. the rhetorical treatment, employed as typical of all the pundits who have tried to dissect the crisis of media credibility in the wake of the comey firing, does not place trump on the same page as their punditry after the fire of thursday's dissemination of the news that revealed the fbi director resigned, and the white house has reacted with apocalyptic warnings that he will ""totally destroy"" the investigation into the russia matter. had mr. trump accepted the release of the corporation report thursday, even if he hadn't been present (even if he never has to be), and simply started insulting cnn and msnbc on friday morning, nobody would have given him a chance. it is arguably appropriate for a president to resort to trump's ""enemy of the people"" on occasion. when president obama called the white house to apologize for its ""poor judgment,"" he was defending the fact that trump had shown a disregard for the relationship between journalists and political leaders. the gop had received negative feedback from critics earlier in their rise to power and depended on those responsible to make the inconvenient truth their party's official policy. the article went on to call for a boycott of the corporation and other news media because it would harm trump's reputation, due primarily to his negative remarks. the reactions were unprecedented. trump blamed nbc for having fabricated the news that reigned so long before trump's election. he also compared the publication of an investigation into his contacts with russians to the ""locker room talk"" with monica lewinsky. in a response, i challenged mr. trump to address his paranoid tendencies and poor judgment by explaining how these are referred to as ""illegal immigrants"" and ""undocumented workers."" in the open interview, mr. trump said the only reason he was elected president was because of his politics — ignoring the president's less popular instincts and failing to explain the extensive range of the insane immigration saga. mr. trump was giving politically inexperienced and out-of-touch reporters legal cover to lie. to my surprise, the news media announced they would look to attorney general jeff sessions for justification for his shooting of a press reporter. with this being said, it is unclear if his consistent lies about cnn co-host chris cuomo and bloomberg reporters influenced how they conducted their interviews. perhaps president trump just hopes to disrupt the ""locker room talk"" in some way. as leaders, we need to speed up the way we are focusing on a bad news story, because we need the rules of the road to stop it, unless we guarantee a window of opportunity for the public to see the full breadth of the story. we are talking, with the right rules, about changing politics, feeding the media, for the greater good. t and z t",grover
892,"The Mystery of the Missing Bus Riders it is time to get back to work in the summer with some fresh airline seats. the americans are as partial to drivers in the united states as spanish citizens are to teachers, or coaches, or other certified passengers. and passengers without miles and miles at all may have stepped aboard their vehicle and paused to examine their license plates, nose sensors, and gps devices before purchasing a new seat. it seems as if it all came together after several conversations this week. but before you give up, first the uber app and soon, the uber app and uber app. the keywords for this new-age boo-boo--update: 100 million people will ride uber on june 30-july 2, according to uber ceo travis kalanick. uber's wheels will turn out to be pleasantly surprised when they land at the airport one day. then it will learn that the new owners and his/her transportation company won't even start accepting new vehicles until they know their way around and repair a body built in-house. back before uber picked up a large chunk of the passenger load, ram trucking the united states was struck by one of the most bizarre announcements of recent times: this was about to be a high-profile launch, but until the uber app was approved, the u.s. commerce department should have inspected new u.s.-licensed drivers on carpool rosters before starting its investigation. that order was made under u.s. rep. frank wolf, d-va., and accepted by the senate transportation committee on wednesday, because uber chief executive officer daniel hertzfeld was planning to make the trip to washington, d.c., to launch the new-age boo-boo ""10-year mobility pass."" ""thanks to in-house civil engineers and the launch of the new windows 8 platform, uber has just picked the 10-year-old field to fly it from the smithsonian,"" u.s. rep. ed royce, r-calif., wrote in a letter to kalanick and the commerce committee, according to the new york times. ""uber and the new consumers who have experienced the ride-hailing experience have had the opportunity to walk in the cockpit and know the ride will start at 7 p.m. and complete three hours of ride ahead of our target time, in almost 100,000 vehicle miles."" here's what happens if these few months of question were to vanish. first, a new passenger has to pay more for the service than the first. second, if a rider is wrong and is a question from another, this fee jumps automatically. if a fellow passenger gets behind their traffic light at nearly 60 mph, their ticket goes to be charged, as expected. (in my experience, the fare gets shifted to the last possible minute after the driver has verified his or her status on a tracking app.) third, if the ""seat"" is old enough to clean it up, the rides will be canceled. at best, it may take 18 minutes until someone in the booking process is able to tell the uber guy, ""we're not going to run a new one."" lack of confirmation. no phone call from a customer. delays at the airport. little failure to deploy a new reservation system that will take any customer's information until they pay. a passenger to that transaction has to show that uber is not doing their business as usual, but also has to say so, to the collection staff, to the cashier and to the chief of the consumer services desk. if uber is investigating the tickets and says it just picked up a lunch of snow wheat, the airline customer will have to provide a ride and pick up the price, and also in this case, he or she will not be charged for it. so where, as we know through the enormous unemployment pick-up, is the conflict of interest between spacex owners? uber made up an easy number: 1,000 new seats. why, then, are so many american airlines waiting until june 30 to confirm new passengers? a year for an alternative to chinese pilots? a decade for a private equity firm, whose executives just made big money? the question of ""appropriate valuation"" (something uber has essentially been doing for a decade, judging by the specific numbers uber used to release results), and the dilemma of ""final destination of service"" is too close to another season, something uber has instead requested in the months leading up to june 30. it's a truism: nearly every launch on that date will take place in san francisco. and uber will be on the pick-up line at the airport for a good four months, starting at 10:30 a.m. every day in the cities from that date.",grover

902,"Opinion | The Pandemic vs. The President by world aids day in 2015, we celebrated the world's first-ever, global goal to eradicate the deadly virus, and we are seeking to spread the cure. our personal journeys toward that goal, however, are often shrouded in controversy, controversy, controversy. like everybody else, we try to avoid it. it reminds us that with all of the challenges we face we never let things get in the way of progress, and we just have to keep getting better. in 2015 we began to see the emerging efforts by many countries to battle the deadly disease. the number of universal public health interventions are projected to reach 3 billion in 2018. by that point, more than 51 million people have undergone treatment, and nearly 1 million have been cured, a remarkable achievement. we also began to see some progress. those who had been treated for malaria had virtually no symptoms. what had transformed was the discovery of a community-based antimalarial medication called replico, which had been stockpiled during the previous epidemics of malaria. with the combination of the four antimalarial medications and the zinc replacement medication, the medication made an immediate and significant difference. it cut off the immune system's responses to malaria and eliminated the need for treatment. but the double whammy is the introduction of even more prescription-drug misuse; many people evade the use of drugs due to stigma, stigma and fear. so we began to wonder if it would be possible to get rid of malaria and get rid of this disease in time. the answer lies in research by friends of mine and others in the field of malaria. i set out to study malaria with the number one goal in mind. i wanted to find the answer to the answer to the ""why"": for the benefit of the public. that is why i plan to detail the results of my recent research at the annual meeting of the american academy of public health (aapph) in san francisco this coming september. my research explores how preventative interventions, like malaria medications, like replico, are linked to the prevention of malaria. the idea is that it's the reduction of symptoms, the delivery of a disease prevention medication to the patient, that makes a difference. it helps the patient decide if their problem with malaria is a health problem, and is then considered critical and prevented. after that, the patients can focus on the other life-threatening conditions that call for a different type of treatment. since the start of this year, more than 3,200 malaria cases have been diagnosed in the u.s. alone and almost 4,000 deaths are attributable to the disease. because the burden of malaria is so low, we are providing treatment to as many patients as possible as much as possible. we are also setting up blood donors to prevent malaria and identify people who are carriers of the disease. we will analyze some results from my research on this topic and make our recommendations to the international medical community. i want to make a point of saying that malaria treatment is not the problem. this is because until the disease is cut off, it is a single disease disease. the simple benefit of malaria treatment is that it prevents infection from getting to the person the disease strikes. there is a ""one shot"" approach that can reduce the burden of the disease. we prescribe malaria medications that are effective against malaria but also must be given to everyone who lives in a region that has the best shot of living on the same bed as a malaria diagnosis. and we also prescribe a new kind of antimalarial pill. i want to assure everyone that this data will be shared with clinicians and private health-care companies to demonstrate that it is possible to minimize the burden of malaria. and my research will be tailored to cases in which all sides of a public-health challenge are equally different and that makes getting rid of the disease easier. and let me tell you that i have taught myself this before: if you want to see progress, not only are you trying to make progress but you want your friends and your colleagues to know too. every person has the right to go to a doctor and ask him to prescribe a new drug. people have to be tried together; they have to accept and think outside the box. that has only been a ""one shot"" approach. i am not going to be the one to make what is going to be a ""one shot"" an ""a.""",grover

(chastity russell, who plays the actress, said she's ""the one we need"" because she's so awful.) and even the snideness and mistrust from david silverman, his cameraman who makes sure to realize his job is more important than his voice. he even gets rick santelli, the bandmate from the spielberg movies, to deal with some of his mismatched nerves. it's all beginning to pay off. the opening scene is a throwback to the king arthur movies and ""the crucible,"" about a high-school boy whose home was changed to a lower-security prison. a menacing, second-grader, wyatt lee, seems to do better than dale carnegie but his ambitions are ill-defined, even after he takes a part in a reality tv show with various audiences. when wyatt asks sally, the blond-haired waitress, why her feelings are all wrong, sally points out that it's just not appropriate. but wyatt's still quite immature, so sally has to convince his old friend to continue what she started. after wyatt returns from trial, he finds a house he spent a lot of time in before being granted the house to be torn down. it's an ugly, ugly place that needs fixing. the upside is that yates (who has written the screenplay for ""spy"" and presumably directed the film) has a clear writing style and is so good at making his characters appealing that he had no choice but to use his thick set voice to deliver a message — ""how do you feel about death?"" he asks the kid in the opening scene. he also adds humor and symbolism. to dana carvey, the character on ""the late show with stephen colbert,"" the movie has a ""mister miserable."" truly, it's silly-looking, but at least it's fun to watch sally — who's without prosthetics — being turned upside down in a trunk while everyone else prances around. of course, that's just gravy.",grover

(adult diarrhea and a cold are particularly common at these times; from 7 p.m. to 4 a.m., get the lowest needed checkups — give yourself at least three weeks of rest.) viruses also regularly appear in person. if you have a fever that could be severe or remain so long, the list should also include symptoms consistent with death. imagine the symptoms that you may receive. everyone who has been sick could experience these symptoms. not having a fever and serious headache caused by the infection can indicate that there is a symptom. a fever can also suggest a condition that should be treated. of course, colds, typhoid and infections with travel sickness can also do the trick. keep a log of what you've been sick, and the flu and other immune-system disorders that may have affected you. piglets are fine to catch. keep a note of your symptoms so you can look for them on the outside of your nose, under your arms, on your lips, mouth and stomach. also track your symptoms closely. it's better to have control measures in place. unfortunately, less-than-perfectly diagnosed cases are the predominant cause of infection. take care when dealing with the virus, especially if you choose to stand it out against the others. keep calm and carry out high-tech surveillance. also, find a licensed pathologist to consult with. don't hesitate to talk to a professional, but do it not only for show, but for public health. ---------- × (c) 2018 of cahuain writer:",grover

""if they had exceeded, they would not have returned to the united states and have not been detected."" one way the virus has been spreading through other countries is with dogs or people who have been exposed to other species of travelers, macmahen said. the institute published the findings in the journal emerging infectious diseases in 2016, accompanied by a statement by an official in the clinton administration, michael ""sherman"" croner. the bush administration did not release data before the publication of the document. like pet viruses, coronavirus has been spreading through humans and birds for decades with a version known as yoca, according to william yang, a microbiologist at the nasa johnson space center in houston, where they treat astronauts' pets and tracheauses.

""the chance of death from disease is not known, but sometimes the probability of death is low,"" epidemiologist pamela pochier of the dutch team of medicine told cnn affiliate dpa. ""most people die from pneumonia but a few people die with diarrhea, but some people cannot even imagine,"" explained elderly man joel gunn. a healthy person typically takes antibiotics and days to recover. but patients will usually heal slowly and without severe pain. this is why they won't survive long. and the same could happen with a coronavirus patient. doctors estimate these cases can take six to eight years to save, but they can be mild or severe. the virus is transmitted through infections to health care workers, doctors, pets, teens, children and very young children. it can be passed by bites, sprains, viral infections, rotting food and other waste products. do these types of infections pose a risk? it's not clear whether prolonged exposure to coronavirus can cause a life-threatening bout of pneumonia. dr. thomas eckman, a senior physician in the patient care unit at marshall children's hospital of tampa, told cnn the virus can spread through blood pressure, blood pressure, liver and brain, and other parts of the body. ""we know that any worsening of symptoms due to a coronavirus infection may be fatal for people younger than 20 years,"" dr. eckman said. the centers for disease control and prevention says that most coronavirus infections are contained in infected eyes, ears and/or skin, or later a person suffers two or more symptoms of the disease. because the disease was transmitted between someone and infected person, someone that contracted the virus and should have known about the infection has immunity. ""once the disease is diagnosed, authorities are notified and a person is brought in for assistance,"" according to the cdc. if a person is infected with a coronavirus infection, they may experience symptoms with varying degrees of illness. particularly severe diseases include chlamydia, gonorrhea, diphtheria, tetanus, malaria, septicaemia, diarrhea, pneumonia, fever, norovirus, norovirus or chlamydia.",grover

920,"Opinion | How Much Worse the Coronavirus Could Get, in Charts how much worse the contagious chills could get, in terms of radiation fallout and infections? and how long it will take for the centers for disease control and prevention to see the full extent of the problem. the cdc has set a likely annual target of two to three years of exposure to chills, which translates to the annual equivalent of at least one case of chills, z, my wife found this week. chills can cause shivering, at times with overzealous drips and air droplets. they can indicate a large risk of infection and can also cause nausea, skin aches, and nauseating diarrhea. and they can cause cancer. patients may also suffer from c. difficile, a blood bacterial infection in which bacteria release as many toxins in the body as they need to work as efficiently as possible in order to function properly. when c. difficile reaches the bloodstream (a more rapid reaction of microorganisms) it can affect cells in the body, reproductive organs, many of which have no blood, making it almost impossible to carry out daily functions. c. difficile is a complication because an adult can become infected within minutes or weeks of infection. mostly, the cdc's estimate assumes that no new cases will be reported because patients don't have symptoms. for example, it should remember that when people are exposed to this type of bacteria they experience higher rates of diarrhea, fever, and swollen lymph nodes. so, any extra dose would probably mean less, but as the cdc itself said, a dose of drugs with lower durations would be much harder to administer. suppose, however, that the situation were more like that of the true or confirmed chills would spread to the whole country. what does all this mean? the cdc predicts that people will develop recurrent cases of vomiting, dizziness, headache, and trouble sleeping in general. a heart attack or seizure could be called ""a strike. never"" in the u.s. similarly, if the chills spread to the next region of the country, how much of it will it spread to other regions? and if people in different parts of the country don't respond to every pill or carb-heavy (or even super-fast) medication, how much of it will it spread over those regions? because people usually do not become infected with chills, they may ultimately become more sensitive to the poisonous chemicals used by this bacterial infection. this could allow the bacteria to re-infect undetected by passing through their receptors in the body. this could contribute to hyperpigmentation and a build-up of bacteria that feed on the surface of people's intestines. it would also look so natural that it was observed by the cdc to infect people with chills. it's less likely that the cdc also investigated other viruses, like mosquitoes, which transmit chills. and it is more likely that chills may even spread to other bodily functions, such as energy drinks, a favorite consumption for the infected person. but these health experts have a fantastic piece of software to scan for other outbreaks. in 1996, according to national institutes of health, chills touched over 2 million people in 122 countries. in 2004, more than 3 million visits to hospitals were reported. thus the experts can now enter a whole host of agencies and individuals to look at and document the real-world chills that people now feel uncomfortable eating and drinking. from those now-referred to chills, they can be closely related to symptoms of diseases like cancer, aids, and malaria. as summarized by robert m. connors, molecular microbiologist and author of diagnostics to heal: understanding the secret history of disease and what to do about it, a chills infection increases the risk of cancers in the brain, particularly of the prostate gland, the lymph nodes and the bladder and a range of other health conditions. this article is provided as follows:",grover

""it is spread through coughing, sneezing, and through urine and feces,"" erik osolfo, immunologist and epidemiologist at the university of switzerland in geneva, told cnn health. he told cnn health that there is no better way to handle the spread of the virus than to help people avoid it so they can protect themselves. the first person to develop the virus is more likely to die: most cases occur in infected people who are normally healthy and rich enough to eat, but others are highly infected, leading to the spread of this virus. the virus is associated with immunosuppressive drugs and immunochemical reactions, not adults, and it can be seen for more than 200 days in a person exposed to it, according to the world health organization. according to the abc website, at least three other canadians and two australians were infected by the virus in a zurich-area resident of the west bank. doctors are waiting for the results of their tests before they can order a diagnostic procedure. ""preventative measures include antibiotic treatment and antiviral treatment,"" swiss health authorities said in a statement. the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) said more than 50,000 canadians were infected by the virus during 2015-2017. the cdc is urging people to be in good working order.

935,"US politics kicked at the doorsteps of his political opponents, old-time liberal andrew j. whyte swore in an administrative assistant who promptly dismissed the young senator and petitioned the supreme court to protect the constitution under the patient protection and affordable care act. so the conservative supporters of obamacare relented, and basically rooted their republican leadership in the region's worst financial crisis since 1929, despite the koch-backed base's widespread support. whyte, a libertarian, is the prime minister of israel, a country that the usa has already fallen into a deep recession and that is heavily dependent on government. this rhetoric was but enough to break the dearth of candidates this cycle, only a few of whom were senior senators, senators or members of congress. last year's primaries were smaller, more ideologically motivated ones that flipped leaders in the battleground states they were home to or, since then, to former president barack obama and for bill clinton. the issue is that the country has in some way contributed to its current dysfunction. serious discussions in washington fail to recognize the stakes. we're essentially governed by a small group of ideologues. they insist on what they're not responsible for, but we just don't get it. the practice of electing members by party and engaging with the president to advance their agenda tells us too little about how we should deal with a matter of responsibility. doing nothing causes government leaders to think twice. president trump has muzzled his chief of staff, jared kushner, who takes personal responsibility for the president's actions, and repeatedly publicly committed the nation's worst national security policy failure to the wrong people. doing nothing is government's method of pursuing a domestic agenda and working to fix that system. the borders of the country are porous and our enemies treat us as enemies with reckless abandon. our ability to control the powerful and avoid crisis and disaster is at stake, and with that comes political accountability. the biggest financial crisis of our time has nothing to do with the system, nothing to do with collective brinksmanship, nothing to do with political gamesmanship between lobbyists and politicians. it's all about the resulting spiraling public debt and the massive waste and fraud we produce in government. keep in mind, however, that the problem is not personnel. it's wealth. as an economist and former professor, i know how to demonstrate in recent years how good it is to put all our people in a place that can make money. too many folks don't know how much they're earning. we're not seeing the impact of the trickle-down wealth effect. that's what tax reform was all about, and tax reform has instead been the result of a triage and a triage exercise. social security and medicare are largely overfunded, and nobody understands how each can account for all that means. we need to address those problems to raise revenue and produce more services. so now and then we have a president who doesn't care about the policies he's implementing, and then a leader who doesn't understand what the problem really is. if we elect more republicans and progressives, we'll see how the system works for decades to come. a blessedly-hearted congress and the citizens who faithfully vote for the constitution's supreme court should share some responsibility.",grover

""everything the monarch did from her inaugural in february 1977 to her life as a british monarch, from her rise to power to her legacy has gone on display in buckingham palace, among many, many media outlets,"" franklin said. the queen's exploits have become far more significant than each other. in 2010 she commanded headlines that people largely saw as election promises — that the queen would not challenge british rule. she was john major's shadow chancellor. in 2011, her husband prince philip was unexpectedly elected to the premiership as caretaker leader. the scandal sparked a global search for a successor and inspired the london evening standard to launch a campaign for the queen's deputy, winston churchill. she kept her distance from churchill, but two years later she called him to present a memorial rock — a reluctant but suitable ship. on the trolley, she met composer freddie flintoff, whose three different fiddle cds devoted to her received greater attention than a number of pop stars, namely elton john. despite the slow pace of the new season, the queen was thoughtful in her respects when describing people on her private plane.

949,"Reality Check to say that the era of digital lying and manipulation and loss of privacy is over in the us and there is indeed something truly unsettling in the wake of 2017 is like saying that is not the era of lies and manipulation, but that 2017, 2018 and 2019 are going to be the years of untold brain damage and chronic indifference that lie has seen in almost every important us government,"" said ady gildal, executive director of the aclu's institute on cybersecurity. ""no one asks for special treatment, or any criticism from government employees, but in that case, the public has no opinion of a government entity to simply trust,"" she said. so whether you agree with, disagree, or share what it is that has been bad in your life, here are some of the things that you should be looking at today. 1. text you you don't want on facebook anyone (anyone with a smartphone) can get on facebook, all the time, and get help looking for problems, or problems when they don't really like you. if your bad judgment is known to anyone, what happens is that one mistake is another but an even more dangerous one, when it comes to regulating your behavior on social media. 2. speaking in other people's language for some, learning a different language could be a new lesson in living your whole life without someone believing in it. however, this often brings with it difficult communication skills, and some users are learning english while abroad as well. 3. embracing the ""engagement required"" mindset opinions on particular topics can be either irrational or deliberately chosen in order to divide the conversation. however, when you think about it, of course, people might not realize just how active social media allows us to be. 4. spreading lies and disinformation failed or participating in deception may appear politically and with one breath, on paper, and that translates into information that requires misinformation or disinformation to be produced in an effective manner. however, fake news is also misleading and harmful. for example, in many countries, disinformation is considered either by the media's professional standards or by the public, or, if one is inclined to classify it as public, it is termed dishonest propaganda, which is a mixture of false and misleading propaganda. 5. how to get in front of public opinion when all the arguments and opinions of our politicians make it to the main presentation, we give it weight, right? wrong. whether you're a person who follows opposing candidates, a political office holder, or an unexpected statement on news, it is more than usually necessary to start quickly, don't wait and see public opinion and make a decision to get involved with the fight or decide who gets in front of the polls. this is the kind of conversation that could ultimately lead to positive developments for the public to take risks in what they want to do on social media and develop their opinions. the executive director of aclu's institute on cybersecurity said the following: ""over the last twenty years, our society has been forced to turn to the digital digital reality for ways to effectively handle complex information for certain countries, when they would rather resort to reporting and distortion than engaging with the facts. with nearly every social change, at least part of the public backlash against such disinformation has been driven by the release of false, troubling and highly damaging information. we can expect many more false and misleading propaganda campaigns that expand to undermine trust in information and the value of information, when there is no time or place for those who disseminate it."" 6. understanding how to deflect falsehoods from one another good news, bad news, and worse lies can pile up online, and undermine trust in the communication infrastructure to communicate with each other and with the world at large. what if you were to one day want to take a step in the other direction? would it be interesting to help in this area? how would you do it? *** cybersecurity and privacy of governments have always been different. however, if the us privacy beleaguered by this dynamic is it, then its case needs to be taken more seriously to grasp how our government, like, for that matter, could harm the public. we urge a mutually beneficial relationship.",grover

""president xi has told south korean officials that he would send an official to south korea on monday. south korean national security officials who are involved in the recruitment of south korean people for the one-time attempt, but who are oblivious to the gravity of this work, are strongly opposed to the u.s.'s attempt to persuade international nations of its commitment to south korea,"" the state department said in a blogpost announcing the change. ""the u.s. has issued a new directive that states that these efforts are not permissible against international peaceful resolution, transparency, or national security interest."" but, there has been no official announcement of that change, leaving the u.s. statement in limbo. mingbo kim, a 26-year-old american from san francisco, uses the english language version of world of warcraft to describe the propaganda effort. he writes, ""the goal of this place is to start a better wars. it starts with the non-sensations and wars, so big money makes the process of collecting propaganda and propaganda so stupid that it doesn't even take more than two hours to make up propaganda."" kim adds that whenever the room, which has already culled a dozen people, features a foreign-language correspondent in asia, the ""adverse implication is always the opposite: he is going to go on with a massive propaganda campaign to persuade the masses that there is no path to freedom, either from china or from russia."" but the room already has worked with numerous chinese media outlets to create visuals for the story. if there is one thing leading up to tuesday's pm story, it is china. and if the chorus persists, a twitter hashtag will break the room. but the fact remains: the amount of content american fans are demanding is such that it will be hard for a figure of some stature to challenge. each of us has ties to the web. some cnn and fox anchor would certainly benefit from them. and if the u.s. government eventually decides that how we use our information information, as it does with cbs's tony fisicco in his writings about the pentagon papers, should be different from what's going on abroad, there will be no more hints on how long it might take to get out of the closet. so, across the country, they will be happy to hear this story will end.",grover

""the environment in which actions are made is very sensitive and it may remain so throughout the investigation and regulatory process,"" harris said. the bbc is the third biggest broadcaster in the world with 10 billion viewers worldwide. its president simon harris was forced to resign in december over the night allegations. ""we are very sorry that the journalist's credibility was found to have been damaged by this recent shoddy piece in the mirror,"" harris wrote in a statement.

960,"Middle East if you think the arab spring is going to be an islamist coup, you're naive. you've seen egypt. after both there and in the middle east all of the political hubbub and passionate rhetoric involved in the recent uprising, the revolution that began in tunisia has led to anti-american demonstrations in key arab countries. and now afghanistan. we've seen revolutions elsewhere. western and arab governments were trying to put an end to the arab spring by basically letting dictators fire down what is now a relatively stable version of democracy in some of the middle east's most traditionally arab nations. a losing battle. unlike pakistan and egypt, they have a weak civilian government and have little effective counterterrorism operations. but they have a radical islamist president. there are reports of violent riots here and in the far east, yet neither has a formal government. the remnants of zaynab, the 15-year-old muslim dictator the autocrat-turned-saudi-made taliban, have become a powerful force in the arab world. many are opposed to nato and russia's plans to join the united states in afghanistan in 2010. there are examples of how countries with general sympathy for the rebels are becoming to radical islamic movements: turkmenistan, lebanon, libya and syria. in iran, iran's revolutionary guard announced it would overthrow the government of president hassan rouhani in june. meanwhile, in egypt, there is an emerging consensus that mubarak might be the last government of the people that can take out the infighting. shiite militiamen loyal to egyptian president mohammed morsi have put fire before the men who have built the strong institutions of egypt's arab spring movement. most of them want to see mubarak go. in egypt, they're calling for elections in the country next spring. the new president's supporters have already set up teams to bring a new opposition to power. in tunisia, now a secular movement, thousands of protesters marched from police cells in tunis city to tahrir square to demand an end to the eight-year dictatorship of ben ali, dictator for 24 years. somalia, the cradle of the arab spring, and syria, are making this long-overdue push. president mohamed morsi, the head of the muslim brotherhood, who has lost every day since taking power, has pursued his program of regime change in egypt for nearly a year. by doing so, he has rebranded an islamist party that was a bad fit for a muslim brotherhood movement, and which has had its head burned in a fire sparked by the repression of peaceful protests. so, the egyptians are preparing to take back the streets. at the same time, though, the oppression of the muslim brotherhood has taken up the work of germany's spd, italy's alt-right and much of the rest of europe. they're all trying to harness the almighty royalist forces, especially israel, in europe's middle east and africa. there are regional theories. with the united states agreeing to provide $33 billion in ground troops to make sure that iraq gets its fighting forces and is held together, a choice on which christians would seek to make the war more difficult for israel. the american-based neoconservatives were actively trying to bring about an independent iran, but these people realize that the danger is there in one faction acting out the other in an effort to sabotage the diplomacy in vienna. they may be putting their own spin on this all too well. but the public of the united states, friends, and allies of israel, still does. this is also an old narrative — western and arab versions of popular revolutions.

""enough with the republicans, democrats"" is one of the suggestions they were, behind closed doors, after 2 years of negotiation, in a disingenuous media warfare that's now a two-way affair. maybe that was the motivation, or maybe even our reluctance to believe the errors of omission, in the democratic party's political acumen. but we all knew there would be plenty of media fodder for virtually every positive comment in the media's breathless coverage of the marriage issue, and the crimes of much worse candidates. the celebrated ""bloggers,"" and the blogosphere's stars who blogged and liked—beyond the dynastic presence of some obama or romney campaign figure—are nothing short of name proof. they are there to impress the world in the advertising medium and economic marketplace, such as humor (the kind of conversation at home we can keep up with on the internet or on the television), understanding the truth, and the weak voice, the inaction, of things the likes of biden and pelosi ""show us the flag."" from michael savage's microtargeting campaign to the negative drumbeat of his forthcoming book ""outnumbered""—which includes ridiculous claims like ""it's a huge mistake for a prospective marriage to be a repeat attack ad against gays""—social conservatives have become the pushback squads in the nation's news, partly because of the usual procrastination and indecision when it comes to meaningful debate. people are antsy to see signs that a television show is really going to lose its audience because of ugly comments and hate speech. rather than us, the appearance of the very real racism in the white house has been castigated as being a republican flash-fire of some sort. i know that hardly anyone lives for this kind of optics. i learned that this week. while there are some videos showing okeechobee's antics—his lawyer and even his wife (he has), as well as videos of the ""great"" ceo sean o'kelly, rocking his infant son—will likely affect, i don't foresee a widespread bad press of this nature from the media. that doesn't mean that he's not pulling a series of big laughs. but there's more than a few conservatives who think these cartoons (of deep-state bogeymen dressed up as artists) really represent a cross-section of democrats, who believe the whole reason to oppose any president is due to the way they manipulate the public and our democratic process. as if that was not enough reason enough for the media to go too far in sticking with a fictional man in the cat's cradle of heat. anyone with a tv show will tell you ""dodgy"" commercials and television has been a whipping game all of their lives, and anyone with the electricity to hear you beat the republicans in the race will tell you you truly hate media. if they once watched a disaster of a presidential campaign and only got to see what was real, with results, and then allow you to watch that, you'll know they didn't really care about the victims, the media's phony excuse for being responsible, and about the causes of the violence in the enemy zone.",grover

972,"Global education school has been an integral part of u.s. education for generations, and right now more and more high school grads are enrolled in both math and science, new data shows. but what makes schools unique? with the nation's demographics changing rapidly, many schools just aren't ready for the age of ""fast learner,"" or the new standard for college graduates. university of michigan researchers analyzed more than 16,000 college graduates from 1986 to 2013 to find out why each of those high school graduates actually went to college. about 72% of the high school graduates said they were probably at school in 2013, according to university of michigan data. though the estimate of these grads may seem high, it's actually the same as ""quick learner,"" or children who had not graduated from school by four years, according to cnn money. ""factors that predict a high school student's likelihood of attending college to such degrees can be analysed using particular information from the survey,"" said dean kirby, an associate professor of education at michigan who led the research. the findings come from a child- and adult-level assessment of more than 1,200 parents in a nationally representative sample of 1,957 public elementary and middle schools that michigan surveyed. about 81% of the parents said they knew their child was going to college, while just 46% knew how many college students they wanted to see in their future, according to the report. one major factor being used in determining how much can be taught in preschool and the next generation – listening to students — was the former. the children born in 1990 now aged five to nine see the impact of fm by more than 6 million by age 10. the percentage of fm participants declines over time, but the study finds that the number of fm participants climbs during those years, based on a linked correlation between fm participants' life spans and the fact that those living in the u.s. are more likely to be in school. previous study has linked fm participation to the health of students aged 10 to 14, but kirby cautions that those odds are generally lower among older students. the long-term effects of fm were also assessed by examining the effects of attention deficits in elementary schools during the 1960s and early 1970s, as well as from early elementary education. ""approximately three-quarters of fm teachers surveyed reported that their students are well-behaved throughout their school days,"" said kirby. ""an important part of this is how the students know they are learning from music and dance, with the last 12 to 17 years of the elementary education being designed to prepare young students for the new age of learning."" but the thing's different from the fm component, according to the authors, which asks students to memorize words or not remember important ones. another factor that will likely be studied at higher levels of education is the number of children who wait their entire life for them to succeed. ""there are still many very early-childhood preschool students,"" said kirby. ""they won't have a mentor with them. they will be segregated from their grandparents or teachers because of that. these kids are very isolated from their grandparents, parents or any teacher or teacher guidance."" and while being in school for a whole year can be compared to being in school full time, one major component of a successful education is through encouraging children to use language well in school. so do the kids who take advantage of their opportunities. kirby pointed out that kids with learning disabilities as well as past or present american challenges are also going to face problems. ""most of our high school grads don't talk to their peers,"" he said. ""they talk to schools but many of these kids don't recognize language, and the kids are never seen outside school.""",grover

982,"Michael Bloomberg: The world's ninth richest man who tried to run for president the smart money was correct to say that michael bloomberg was the most democratic new york governor in history. well, bloomberg has made that abundantly clear. from bloomberg's announcement in new york on saturday night that he's the forbes' 21st richest man, to the claim that he had $2.5 billion in assets, from his inheritance, from his son's business, and from people including michelle obama, that he's somehow more powerful than their own president. that would be the article, published by bloomberg's true.com website, made on april 4 on the topic: the world's 10 richest people. all the while, forbes was right to say that all of the times bloomberg appeared on the cover of the magazine there was, at least in some parts, a correction, one in which he was featured on camera — a protest, by then. but his perspective was nuanced. he was moved by an observation by a reporter a year ago in a story about the occupy wall street protests. it turns out, although not an articulate position he does fully agree with; it wasn't changed during his 30 years as mayor of new york city. ""it does matter where you were in your life, how a person ended up,"" he says. ""there are moments in life where people became very proud of who they were, maybe they were all very self-sufficient, and people think of it as motivation, where there might be negative aspects of who you are, but that feeling actually changes behavior."" politically, it's easy to see why. bloomberg's new times square address, surrounded by umbrellas and signs with ""nynymayor"" emblazoned across it, has hosted everything from 300 speakers to more than 300 songs. and he not only has his tight end in the ring with political opponents — who might not want them talking about him — but he is having a good time. if he wants to run for president, he should get as organized as anyone else — yet he claims to take the lion's share of the wealth. another reason why he chose to buy a house in the central park area.",grover
983,"Super Tuesday: BBC finds Bloomberg campaign offices empty (cnn) — there are no standing still. despite the slight tilt of the polls, just a few super pacs—pro, anti, business—eliminated anti-establishment, or both — were either dead silent or done trying to chip away at trump's bigger mandate as a popular president. in the process, the unholy alliance was undermined by the successful, and ruthless, fundraising of its chief rival. in other words, the combined efforts of a pro-trump group and pro-trump-softened anti-establishment groups pushed trump's electoral victories by more than 2-1/2 points. at this rate, it is unlikely that trump will win a second term unless the pro-trump, pro-business, pro-choice forces finally stop foisting the delusion that nothing more than a trump presidency will do anything short of dwarfing either a last-minute move to taper bankroll trump's candidacy or a well-planned jubilant ""everything will be ok."" indeed, the lp/gop campaign structure and funding methods and communications tactics have very clearly proved to be — and indispensable for — the fight for the next four years between the president and the extraordinarily successful, pro-trump machines that succeeded in knocking him out of the white house. and according to john wells, a graduate student in the economics of politics at the university of illinois, the system was not only for the interest of the large numbers of americans that elected trump and the ultra-conservative machine that won the primaries and caucuses of party primaries, but was also as much an impact in determining whose election could be won. ""what really surprised me was that we are, at least in the sense that this place is sort of the failed political space for democrats and jingoists, for liberals and socialists, because the united states has a diverse set of other countries, which means you can combine from different traditions. that's one of the reasons why i think the u.s. is so large and so well known in the world."" at the same time, he believes that as a rule, ""the pro-trump base feels the need to respond to political events, and therefore the centrist lobbies and the moderate speak-it-all movement have been very effective, they have elevated the pro-trump party in this sphere with their rhetoric and their contacts in people who are deeply passionate about that."" thus while no pro-trump groups participated in the campaigns, the pro-populist groups did enter the 2016 election. that rationale has been challenged repeatedly by the proposals and agendas of republican candidates who also took on the ideas of a reformer populist that elected the first sitting president. but even while the pro-trump groups continue to downplay the problem of their partnership, they continue to pass along their message, and are now waging a more friendly counterattack, coming on the heels of their own anti-trump campaigns during the campaign. that does not mean that anyone on trump's political team should not be concerned about the chances that the pro-trump union entice at least some of their own supporters into their campaign by threatening to yank their funding if trump does not deliver. politicians often suffer a crisis of faith in any organization they run. they feel they are automatically safer to make that claim if the party, its members and its supporters would give them a comfort level by talking in the same language they have — but the energy that someone who votes for them can turn into a potential competitive advantage in the real world is all going to be brought forward by their supporters. ""are you making a promise right now to your supporters that if you do not make an executive order, you will, they'll know that something has happened,"" wells asks. ""but you don't really know."" so again, we have to look at how far the ""political entities that lost money on both the campaign and the elections were able to outperform other groups in terms of fundraising and in times of disruption."" it also brings up the practical problems that are beyond trump's control: the impossibility of certain policies being implemented, such as a healthcare mandate that could interfere with how much cash the trump campaign raised in a single day, the inexorable quest for wholesale decentralization of power, and, more especially, the balancing act to resist the temptation of doing everything within the rules to achieve the opposite effect. jeffrey katz is a former journalist.",grover

""those accomplishments are not new,"" sanders said, predicting the labor market is heading in the right direction in the united states. he continued, insisting the successes in his young country should be cited again on television. ""if we can't get a job, we have nothing left to do,"" he said. ""we are behind. it's not important anymore to me that the country is where we are, it's important for me to pass this bill, which i believe should be passed. i got my own health plan and people who are living in poverty can get them all right."" the first-term senator said there are ""serious problems"" in north carolina, which he briefly mentioned in june, but many people took that as an indication of the depth of his opposition to trump. ""we are at a point where because of fear, we are taking on policies that would make the country unsafe for military personnel,"" he said. ""and the president of the united states seems to be continuing to blame wall street and president obama for failing our economy."" sanders said the country still has work to do. ""more important, our country needs a president who would show no weakness — for those who stand up for the people,"" he said. ""i don't like those types of characterizations, but i do want a president that i can stand up to not only if he said or done something wrong."" and he called on voters not to respond to ""our military and the country's problems"" by supporting him and the republican ""establishment."" in that case, he plans to run a public education campaign focused on why he is against a fantasy of education reform, and how he would protect wealthy taxpayers, he said. when the last ad aired on cnn, calling president trump a ""crooked, nasty, blind man"" of a president who treats hispanics as ""dirty chickens,"" he demanded that the man apologize to all those hispanics who were hurt during the immigrant crisis.",grover

1005,"Coronavirus: How to clean your smartphone safely your smartphone is the perfect time to investigate just how much your smartphone can harm your health. i have found that the summer sun and sultry moon make it harder for phone and smartphone viruses to spread among folks in your area. and while i am not dismissing the spread of viruses or worms, i am warning people. it is advised to protect yourself with one of three basics you must do for sure – your smartphone must be unbootable, unbreakable, uninfected, and fully open before you use it. if your phone is not unbootable, you will likely be stuck with the infection for a while, and until some work can be done by the disease patient or hospital to clear the infection, you are out of luck, as this obviously will happen to many of you. it's a great idea to check your computer for any viruses or worms that may cause the symptoms: was there a time you had any damage? did a phone run a virus? if not, your phone is probably unlabeled, or if it is in air in an enclosed area and a space as small as your stomach, there is another option – be sure you lock and wipe your phone with a toothbrush, including unbootable. your phone does not need to be in an open area for sensitive or sensitive materials to be infected, as the only place this sort of thing happens is in a bathroom or open window. a phone is over its electronic limits. but it is important to ensure that your phone makes it through most of your physical and occupational exposure, since those areas on which the phone is not exposed can cause you significant health problems. if you have a smartphone with a visible virus that has become infected, it is best to just leave your device untouched until you are better secured. you may also want to carefully dispose of your wireless infrastructure as well. your carrier may restrict or enable certain phones to be used as an enclosure of wireless infrastructure, but that is not consistent with your existing coverage (i used the wireless carrier policy for 2009). on the flip side, if your phone is exposed to a virus, your carrier may not use the carrier as a guide about your carrier's use of your phone. there are exceptions, of course. you can still use a smartphone that is bootable, and you may want to ensure that your phone does not detach from a wireless infrastructure and will continue to fly without telling your carrier. if you are in a public location or have been anywhere in areas where there is no documented outbreak, then your phone needs to remain undamaged for future testing. even though you might be ready to update your device, your cellphone needs to be hooked to a wireless network. as with the wireless network, there are a few steps that you may want to consider before downloading the carrier-approved software. sending your phone to a local operator that can receive update notifications should be faster than waiting 30 minutes for the firm to send it to the sender. if your phone is either unbootable, unbreakable, uninfected, or fully open, well, you have a right to not have your phone up and running again without exposing it to potential infection or virus. this is especially important for people experiencing sudden and severe drops from the steps in the steps i discussed above.",grover

""the goal is to reach the widest possible audience,"" green said. ""so that's the way we offer our service...it's not necessarily advocacy, it's not necessarily advertising."" consumers can enter once per month through a personal ""q&a"" app, which lets a user call the charity about their contacts that match their gender. they can also request a male urinal as well as a female.

1012,"Smart motorways plan aims to boost safety from a sleek sleek exterior to the posh interior, the smart park for connected cars project has gone through significant improvements for the city, representing some of the most horrific crashes on the roads around the country. at ground zero, a massive traffic tragedy, a parking ramp and the ground floor of a converted military school called vakon opal built to make it a safe place for all but the bravest of those taking their yearly vacation at the gym, repairs have been made, a local court was relocated and the parking ramp is now comparable to an office tower. but while dozens of these improvements were made before the tragedy, these improvements occurred at a time when technology might not be so helpful for long term safety. the smart park and parking ramp are what saved lives, especially for those with long commutes. unfortunately, a recent study (pdf) by navigant's insurance survey (apropos of navigant's award-winning series evaluating claims for auto insurance and how drivers experience those expenses) found that too many owners reported delays of at least 2 minutes or more in their car crashes. the reason is simple: cars are so advanced, it is impractical to continually upgrade them. it's important to consider the underlying reasoning behind this effect when considering a deductible of $1000 or more and achieve continued safety. that remains extremely difficult to achieve with any technology, but it should be particularly important when operating a vehicle in extreme traffic conditions. only high-quality, technology- and communication-oriented technologies are able to make even the most proficient cars and vehicles crash without rumbling into each other. so with this analysis, navigant noted that their findings on technology and safety are the opposite of what most other insurance data suggest. in a nutshell, injuries to drivers and victims of a major crash increase by 85%, and deaths are also reduced by 77%. many other studies suggest that cars are driving more independently than in peak times, by a majority of 2%, although that doesn't mean one driver gets hit with head or neck injuries. still, safety improvements for drivers on all parameters are the same thing. landings, use of the correct navigation system, etc., are all great improvements in passenger safety, but they are often not implemented until at least before a crash occurs. one approach that seems to work better for most is the smart park. like other approaches to collision mitigation, this technology aimed to increase pedestrian safety, so commuters stay in the loop when approaching traffic on the road. the city explains that it has also turned to overwork to boost pedestrian safety and their ability to hold passengers for as long as possible. not all pedestrian safety measures are found in the smart park, at least not on every speed limit or active oncoming moving sidewalks. it is a myth that pedestrian safety is solely caused by cars and traveling quite carefully (it is possible that roadworks causing damage to the flow of traffic can also create avoidance of obstacles), but its true magnitude is less and less because hundreds of thousands of pedestrians die and thousands more are injured each year. in addition to reduced losses for drivers on tight traffic (and making more of them safely disabled), it can also add to costs for apartment dwellers. the smart park does not implement optimal pedestrian traffic design for that specific type of traffic. instead, it can minimize the need for non-lethal assistance such as use of a pedestrian control device like a strong, level of foot and the ability to manually go into a path of traffic. and, of course, pedestrian safety is made more difficult by the increasing presence of cars, making pedestrians less inclined to get out of the way. when evaluating self-driving cars, another helpful strategy is to watch how fast the car runs to slow down traffic (just not directly, it is much faster), as shown by a recent survey done by the colorado dmv. all 90 percent of respondents reported that they have engaged in a 75 mph zone early in their driving, which might indicate that they are actively accelerating their driving habits to accelerate traffic. in other words, while they may not be at an optimal velocity, that is a good measure of how fast they are moving, and that in turn can help reduce their chances of injuries and death. most importantly, it allows people to have the options they want when it comes to their car when they choose to drive to work.",grover

""but i would note that, like everyone else, we have yet to receive any briefing from this court."" attorneys for the government and manning's u.s. attorney filed a joint brief questioning the timing of the june 2016 detainer, which has languished since its release. in the brief, the attorney has asked the court to decide what time period justice department lawyers will seek to obtain the documents and the continued implementation of a court-ordered detainer. the court meets once each day. at the time of the detainer, president donald trump signed an executive order extending the terms of the detainer. the order lifted the stop-gap provision and set the process a few weeks ago. manning was captured by fbi agents from his home in manning's hometown of fort hood, texas, in december 2013. one of obama's top diplomats in iraq, manning is based in florida. cnn has reached out to manning's attorneys for comment. the defense contends manning attempted to obtain classified information from the defense department, which was less than 16 months after obama took office. the judge previously ruled manning had access to confidential information and withheld it. manning was sentenced in december to 20 years in prison for leaking information to the website, wikileaks, about soldiers' rapes, sexual assaults, hostage takers and preparations for the 2010 u.s. invasion of iraq. the court-ordered detainer is a ""hard-right"" document the judge decided was secret. manning's attorneys contend the litigation was closed by the sentencing and that he is entitled to a new trial. manning was working at fort hood at the time of the hack.",grover
1014,"Guinea-Bissau: Political chaos could boost cocaine trade by sam leyne a west african cocaine-smuggling route could be linked to increased drug trafficking in guinea-bissau by islamic groups and political turbulence in the north of the country, analysts said. a spy from the ministry of political affairs (mde) told the world drug report that president faustino timbuktu, who departed guinea-bissau earlier this week, was traveling with dangerous vips including chief osama zamudio, the spy head of the ncmoc, as part of a delegation of eu ministers, the paper said, citing jean tegua achie, the head of the ncmoc. although poverty and violence are not new problems for the franco-guinea-bissau government, in the 40 years since president francisco bagro diallo fled with his wife la marate, separatist forces have attempted to fragment the region. nyajine cahal, a french ngo and rebel leader, told the world drug report that criminality in guinea-bissau is among the problems affecting the drug industry in the east of the country, saying: ""coles [belières, a major international cocaine market], which could leave such colombian narcotics gangs open to the possibility of smuggling the drugs to the west african continent."" according to mr. cahal, the primary driver of illicit drug trafficking is the route via the côte d'ivoire–afrique nationale. ""the organisation of safe passage exists through the movement of arms, drugs and ammo into the majority of illicit trafficking areas in the country,"" he told the world drug report. this report warns that the key risk is the emergence of terrorist groups that the country's security forces are unable to tackle. a 2002 arms embargo still remains to be implemented in the country. in 2018, the estimated cost of fighting the militants in guinea-bissau's northern region stood at $2.6 billion. this figure includes the $800 million costs of the ongoing offensive by the armed forces and security agencies in the south and the budget of the international bloc that provides funding to the conflict. mr. cahal said: ""the two major problems in the country today, in terms of the state of lawlessness and security forces, may just be the new drug enforcer."" he added that the polluting activities of military forces have made the task of fighting all the criminals more difficult. he also pointed out that the stability of the country is only guaranteed once there is permanent peace and stability is restored, and that the application of a criminal law is high. mr. cahal was also critical of the inter-continental hotel, which has been guilty of the same high level of violence that has dogged guinea-bissau for years, especially when it reopened amid renewed insecurity after the united nations called for a cease-fire two years ago. but mr. cahal said: ""as long as the establishment of a militia and the role of police are still considered the state of law, criminal structures inside the political systems must be destroyed or used as a model of resilience."" the west african regional bloc called for a ceasefire, the release of prisoners of war and for the commission of elections that would pave the way for constitutional reform. it said efforts should be made to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in guinea-bissau, in areas that are already plagued by civil war and logistical bottlenecks.",grover

""it's so exciting that there are such huge reptiles out there like there were after my grandfather joined the [prn]."" mahon now works as head of the reptiles committee at the agns archives, the world's largest research archive of the species. as for the palaeontologist's findings, there's evidence that a fossil found near prn in a traditional antelope trade corridor in the jungles is not the kind that humans knew it was. the historical discovery, led by james munroe of canada's university of toronto, was years in the making. it was his eight-point scale, with a first grade-appropriate household name already found on the right, that helped him reach down to the top, the step that left the pitiful molds sandwiched between giant feathers and animal jaws. related content a far-flung way to find dinosaur fossils prof. munroe began compiling a database of the maki, an ancient, paleontological group with a rich history of the equinoxes. the short scale favored those creatures, which are incredibly close together, so the maki material, like the starfish pups found in northern siberia, was stumped. the researchers wanted to find the skeletons, and conducted searches by ferrosphere and vacuum rooms to the teeth of the fossil. mcaahon, with his group, searched x-ray models, antialiachosaurs, and fossils for caves.

""meltdown"" would be perfectly acceptable. but the medical regulator says gardasil is not unsafe for human use, but it is irresponsible, because it is not safe to give vaccines to people without the risk of disease or a particularly severe form of immune deficiency. robertson has pointed out in open letters to turnbull that a major error in diagnosis and the safety of vaccines for everything from cockfighting to cancer is that people need only high-dose doses and thus the government is not acting in the best interest of the health of the population. still, he says ""meltdown"" could occur in the case of global new disease. vaccines are routinely delayed, vaccines are discounted and the system of treating all active diseases is under attack. i'm not saying that's not the problem, but i am saying that it is a very, very, very wrong view of what it is to be a leader of a health care system with no transparency, no openness. that includes saying that australia's government is about more than dumping the vaccination program, as if to say that it is either mentally incompetent or is unable to provide what it wants. what's the big deal? australian deaths according to the australian institute of public health, the killer of between 1,271 and 1,870 people in the past 10 years has been a man. while the numbers for human-caused deaths are small and are most likely a result of strains of influenza, the same over-reliance on vaccines as in the united states will result in over-production of vaccines. more than half the killings have occurred in australia, according to the world health organization. australia is the world's largest health care service for every nation, provided a primary care environment that fosters the engagement of healthcare professionals, as in hospitals, family support agencies, health information systems, and health clinics and health-care services. according to the brennan centre for justice in the united states, an estimated 600,000 people die from infectious diseases each year. according to the nih, 1 in 4 people worldwide have the virus that causes human disease or is responsible for that death. at the federal level, the report on this disease estimates that the number of deaths caused by human-caused diseases, which are primarily caused by the vaccines, is estimated to be 60,000. roughly 50 million of the deaths are in the united states, with figures representing 100 million deaths worldwide. most deaths have been in asia. india is a notable example of a country without meaningful national health care, with an estimated five million deaths from communicable diseases every year. the percentage of all deaths attributed to various forms of disease in india is in the one-quarter range. the number of deaths in developing countries, which include india, russia, china, the caribbean, jamaica, the philippines, and new zealand, is estimated to be under 400,000 annually. the bauhaus theory says that the one in 20 most severe diseases are caused by human-caused diseases. an additional 10 million deaths in the world each year are attributed to infectious diseases, according to its molecular analysis.",grover

1035,"Coronavirus: How to clean your smartphone safely keep your smartphone safe. a california dermatologist and researcher says the world's most frequent infection for most people isn't even eating this particular cell phone. it's a brain cell linked to immune infections, a particular cell-cell cyclical tick in the body. while it's not a confirmed case of coronavirus, infections happening with the digital world are happening. you know, where people suffer from a sickness which they think will kill them, or possibly cause big injury when they fall. those symptoms are known as coronavirus jabs, and they're sometimes caused by form of inflammation in the brain or elsewhere. so as many as 2.6 million people are treated for coronavirus-related illnesses worldwide annually, according to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention. most coronavirus cases are avoided by using a protective device. but some technologies can even be taken advantage of. one is microlite, developed by georgia tech health and injury research institute of atlanta, which uses simple but serious ways to replace old phones with microplastic for only about 10 cents per charge. they use a recessed silver pouch that attaches to the smartphone, at or near the tip of a metal tripod. microplastic is a fluid, patient-friendly material that can withstand a continuous treatment within hours. because microplastic is a soluble polymer, it doesn't break up easily. by separating small chunks of malignant tissue from the cells, microplastic can avoid damaging cells while shedding others. the plastics get sticky enough to travel onto medical equipment, which can kill and leave us all baffled. the bit on the other end of microlite's packaging gets too odorous. even before microlite's sales began more than five years ago, the industry was buzzing about it. small bottles of microplastic in bags and cartons changed hands. microplastics were hard to find, and the bags had to be placed in plastic stores, creating a barrier between the bag and an injured patient. the packaging became unusable, the condition going into oblivion. some even labeled it as the ""microlite pad."" ""if you don't like microplastic items, you shouldn't buy them,"" lead researcher dr. tom savage said. ""that's the reason we think microplastic is so dangerous."" with microplastic, microlite can break up in seconds. if you have medical equipment that turns out to be old, microplastic may be as problematic as a smartphone. if you bought your device when it came to purchasing what you thought was good quality, microplastic can break up easily and result in a certain type of tissue rupture. microplastic biopsy strips will be used to smooth out dead cells from tumor tissue, allowing the patient to be discharged and spent at rest. microplastic strips are fast-growing and easily installed, so they don't lose shape. so they are expensive. they're fairly common and less widespread. savage and his colleagues developed a program to diagnose and treat thousands of cell lite cells, including some with symptoms of coronavirus. they use microplastic strips to remove tiny bits of tissue, like sections of a prostate gland, out of a cell. doctors give them to the patient to analyze, take temperature readings, and then send those results to the college of physicians and surgeons of colorado at colorado springs, where surgery is scheduled to begin within three weeks. the procedure costs anywhere from $600 to $300,000. the procedure is most common in the rural area, where cancer is prevalent. it also is done under controlled conditions, with a lot of wireless privacy. the team does not have the perfect approach to the procedures, savage said. ""this is a new technology that will improve the care of cancer patients by enhancing their security,"" he said. for now, the team is operating at patients at colorado springs in an elderly patient ward and in a busy hospital at the university of colorado. it's making phone calls so far. after they complete the tests, they hope to perform a successful surgery. staff writer eric russell contributed to this report.",grover

""i go to over 100 funerals, and this time is different,"" said maykoon. maykoon died in india's pathania district of western uttar pradesh in february after going missing for 11 days. in an interview with this website, maykoon said that he did not miss any funerals. ""many of my friends, they were in sleep and i don't like to hear about that,"" he said. ""i want to focus on healing."" his case is, of course, most important because he was last seen alive on feb. 12. though uttar pradesh authorities are not yet releasing details about what transpired, it is clear that maykoon was killed shortly after he was reported missing. the police said the death was due to a lack of communication between the two. maykoon's abduction was the deadliest in his life, a fact which investigators are struggling to understand. (an email sent to dharmendra kaur, the home secretary in the uttar pradesh capital, lucknow, reported that a villager who was recording the dna on maykoon's camera said the body was stuck between two dna markers.) ""relatives of the deceased asked the family to take care of the family members too. the deceased's parents could not send anyone to retrieve the body for some time,"" said a police official in lucknow. (the presence of the missing person's family can be gauged with the presence of those living with the victim. some people, especially those relatives of the deceased, are annoyed when questions of the missing person's identity are left unanswered.) partly, maykoon's problems are explained by the fact that his gps locator was at the site of his disappearance. but the gps's location is also vital: even on an 8-kilometer map, it would not be clear how long it was taken from the location. a map of uttar pradesh, like sharma's, would be different from that of the rest of the country. maykoon had lived near the border in uttar pradesh for several years when he took his family back home in the late 1990s. his brother and sister met from prison in 1983 to practice at a camp after a family of paupers detained him and his wife for poaching their cattle. maykoon found his way back to the camps near his flat, where his partner and others were living. the wife and his partner began questioning the men around him. they had broken their trance to visit the den, where they interrogated the men about their daily lives in order to find out what happened to their wife. after the women returned, she engaged in conversations with the men, telling them that she had vanished. she and the wife did not tell the men what happened to her. they stayed put for nearly three months, and continued talking about their (swearing) experiences of living at the camp. none of the men, even the two accused, acknowledged that they had disappeared. the main question they had to answer was that of the women. the men said they had gone to birbhum village, a village in uttar pradesh, where maykoon had gone. maykoon had come home two days after his body was found. once they had returned, a group of men and women with him left for their homestead, where they collected the body, wrote a testament to maykoon's life, and explained where the dearest people were. the men and women replied that they did not know where maykoon was. the men, she added, did not know where he was. when pressed further, the men and women said they did not even know where his body was found. few people, in general, remember the differences between maykoon and sharma. those who know maykoon say that he was an intelligent student and was given just one exam. sharma, on the other hand, was not a good student; he had reportedly been tortured by the police twice. follow stories like this at yourtango.",grover

1047,"How Europe deals with terror offenders when they are freed from jail by steve vaughn: cnn for nearly a century, europe has tried to stem the tide of immigration from dangerous countries, some of it from foreign spy flights, a massive briton truck bomber, and a suicide bomber disguised as an olympic cheerleader. president barack obama, french president emmanuel macron, italy's prime minister paolo gentiloni, the united states, the vatican, portugal, italy, and mexico have all quietly helped curb the flow of people fleeing instability, thanks to immigration systems that keep many migrants within reach. but the whole system runs contrary to the law and leaves asylum seekers or refugees without legal protection unless they have a clear case that should be turned over to the police for deportation. ""for too long we have allowed the institutionalization of the political influence of the executive branch,"" said steven brauser, the director of our north africa & middle east center at syracuse university in new york. ""now they're spending more time on implementing specific prevention and response measures than they have for any longer and by the time that's completed, they will be having to implement another crisis, with all the possible consequences."" in reality, just a tiny fraction of 10,000 people traveling from 20 different countries — most of them syrians — are currently getting some kind of protection from the arrival of a military force, like the us marine corps. many are migrants who arrived in europe without an appointment, or have family members who are killed in the conflicts in their home countries. president trump recently announced a plan to decouple americans from military immigration into a citizenship program, creating the phasing-out of 18,000 deferral deferral cases nationwide. thousands of refugees who arrived in europe in 2015 by choice now are on the run, and military officials are asked to step in to help.

""while we can't justify the atrocities that they've committed, we understand that they were hardly unknown,"" president trump said. ""they stood guard at a facility here in america, watched american citizens at home go on hunger strikes, and are portrayed as heroes, whether on television or in court."" president trump and the department of homeland security last month released the names of 1,000 inmates from britain's metropolitan police service (mpis) that had been indicted on charges of the murder and sexual assault of a soldier. most are under overburdened with criminal and immigration procedures, and their names have been being handed over to a judge for deportation, and 30,000 other alleged criminal suspects from libya, italy, and greece have been granted asylum or refugee status in european union nations. this migration pattern has been building for years, and the trump administration has not stepped up or slowed it down.

""for our people, freedom under abiy ahmed was a badge,"" an official told cnn turk on sunday. ""for us, abiy ahmed was ethiopian leader with vision, vision and with peace."" yusuf jamil abiy, a former office manager in the oil and gas industry who died on march 8 after fighting with the ethiopian military, became the symbolic leader of abiy ahmed's government after his resignation from the ministry of state security after nearly a decade in office. from freedom under abiy ahmed to repression under abiy ahmed, world's worst anti-semitism previous to this abiy ahmed vowed to get back to his former course and start with government-led reforms, the u.n. official said. he was sacked after nine months in office, said the u.n. official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic. the former government official said that the current transitional government suffered more setbacks than in abiy ahmed's first tenure. three months after abiy ahmed's election, the government began a crackdown on protesters, training law enforcement and social welfare workers, said the official. at the same time, abiy ahmed launched human rights group amnesty international to be involved in protests against his decisions in the disputed 2015 referendum he won. amnesty said this month that this was largely due to abiy ahmed's military-backed militia acting out of self-interest. arguably, from abiy ahmed's role as the former commander of the ""boy scouts of america"" group -- a u.s.-based adidas company -- in somalia ""was a calling for freedom of the environment,"" the edp official said. abiy ahmed's election in a country where urban segregation is not well policed, an influx of ethiopian migrants fleeing poverty in neighboring eritrea, south africa and the gulf have historically been identified as racist. people see the ethiopian government's bid to legislate muslim immigration as a way to ensure abiy ahmed's hold on power. dissident abiy ahmed has called for an investigation into the violent threats he faced, including shootings and arson in january that left more than 20 people injured. in december, abiy ahmed sent a condolence letter to president abiy ahmed saying that thousands of muslim students and teachers were at high risk in government schools, and for people in public places where political gatherings are banned. ""from the public areas in response to the threat of political violence, which was instituted by the ethiopian authorities, thousands of people were subjected to harassment,"" the letter said.

1049,"Guinea-Bissau: Political chaos could boost cocaine trade the eve of guinea-bissau's presidential elections is drawing to a close, after losing a high-profile court ruling on allegations the government intended to win by turning off voters. but in another potentially ominous development, president joseph bozize's socialist government could be in for a hard landing if the election is fraudulently. with the presidential election set for april 17, bozize may still face a senate run-off in the face of strong protests from farmers. in the end, the struggle for control of the country's cocoa harvest will depend on the outcome of the results: an untested, slimmed-down government with a socialist background and heavy reliance on the u.s. drug industry for raw materials. with its relatively young legislative body now overseeing the approval process, just as it did in 2001, guinea-bissau may get little respite from the people's fury over the election fraud. that's why the government is pushing ahead with electoral reforms that are designed to create a less democratic government. in the wake of a crime investigation that's classified as a ""state crime"" and released publicly to the media thursday, president bozize conceded that he was setting up a ""compromise"" government. ""there will be an eventual politicisation of the electoral system,"" he said during a three-day visit to the central african country. but there are serious concerns about seeping in with the new political environment. ""insecurity has multiplied. factors that will prevent a normal political process will flourish, which could be a source of instability. the stock market has been volatile,"" his ministry of finance official joaquim tavares told afp, explaining that investors have been concerned that too much had been done for too long. ""this could be the most unpredictable and costly period of the transition to change in a long time,"" he added. the criminal groups largely run money for political purposes while donors are still largely ruling elites, blamed for the mess the nation has made since it fell from grace. a little over a year ago, there was a resurgence of street protest groups in the streets of capital conakry, but they largely abandoned their peaceful action to increase more violence. the police have curbed their sentences but remain an organised and civilian group, often with only state support and ammunition. already, the president has accumulated a rash of corruption allegations, with former finance minister delysa cunha having received around $4 million in bribes for fixing a project to take copper out of liberia. bozize has dismissed concerns from some of the opposition that his rule is being rigged in favor of the government. the referendum this year for a new constitution is due by july 30. but opposition parties have expressed concern about a delay in taking the referendum seriously. current laws empower the government to cut spending and approve projects from budget until it shows ""clearance"" from the constitution. analysts say that if the electoral commission is rigged in favor of a single candidate, the process will have become more dubious. it would also increase the risks of conflicts between the government and opposition, potentially widening the election to try to determine who represents whom. the socialist opposition is also concerned by the fact that the anti-government opposition has yet to register in the polls, which could in turn boost the government's chances. the social democrats are doubtful that election authorities will handle the vote properly. but they'll rather use the help of undercover police posing as victims. the christian science monitor's germaine baume explains the challenges to an already a democratic government:",grover

1054,"Confessions of a call-centre scammer by annette jones got a call home? if it's a pesky slip, beware of recurring calls to a call center, says an expert in identity theft protection. peter huard told cnn he's lost roughly $200 to $300 in expensive customer service calls last week. he says the problem lies in the complex notion that a call center costs only what the calls cost. ""the most nefarious kind of call centers try to order a call as many times as they can to get better quality of service, and often times add on money,"" huard said. but experts say many call centers pay only what they think customers want, meaning that the action is only really worth what the profit margin is. ""they're better off deciding to do things properly, and be transparent with the customer about the type of calls and how the service is really going to work,"" huard said. but it doesn't get a pass from the commercial service providers, he added. he may be paying the same premium for calls that aren't ordered, but the cost of entry can be a huge percentage. when the wrong call comes up, a call center will ask you to fill out an affidavit confirming the call is yours, in case your bank never called, he said. ""the phone can ask if you're a customer of a bank so it can tell you how big the loan is, but if you don't take it, it is not even that important for a call center to ask,"" he added. experts also blame credit card companies for low enough call volume to run out of customer checks. if your bank refused to refund you, you could have a new one, he said. that doesn't mean that your credit report has been sorted out yet, since your name has not been on it. but that could be done by way of a fraud warning or by telling the company that your account was closed. while you have the right to sue for fraud, and if your bank told you you were covered, you could potentially file a claim in court, said edward gerson, a creditor attorney who advises people who have credit card questions about atm fraud. and with consumer information inaccessible, they say they're at an increased risk of falling victim to a bad call center, which they call ""predictable."" ""a lot of times, they're seen to have an aura about them because they take credit card for legitimate purposes and repeat the fraud,"" he said. the fact that you have information about your account may prompt a call center to investigate, including questions about account settings. any company should alert its customers immediately.",grover

(haha, yeah, a recurrence. do you think you do that?) the isavirus, a virus linked to global epidemics including zika and stds, is a type of the gastrointestinal virus found in more than 100 million people and germs in over 22 million. once it's dead, it can transmit it through coughing, sneezing, mouth dissection and vomiting to your body. as it gets older, the human immune system detects and destroys the virus and stops the transmission and subsequent genetic modification of it in the body. so how do you answer the phone? do you either test your system, or do you just drop the phone down and it emits three-dots that causes huge unwanted flickering on your computer screen. ""if the clock has slowed or the virus has grown or spread, it will send its new signal through your computer,"" says the site, which discovered this error on march 18. then from there, it will be sent through the gastrointestinal tract to the brain, said the site, which was also able to track from where the virus is known to have grown in living mice to a personal computer set it up. what's really baffling is that the virus spreads only at the farthest point of the gastrointestinal tract, rather than the farthest point of the brain. it's important to understand how and why your computer screen is blowing up right now, said webmaster of medicalaware, an online health information provider. on the page, ""how do you create a virus code that doesn't break,"" says the site.

1059,"Why is the Palace of Westminster falling apart? here's the shocking thing about this historic reopening: it is precisely the kind of thing prince george or princess charlotte likes. look, the palace is still standing, and everyone still wants to tie it to them. but it's suddenly fall apart. it wasn't a gift that prince george ever wanted. it was something he named an elevator and that he acquired on his own. it was some sort of anchor that he loved: a good one. the reason: what keeps this building alive, and who's going to stop that? that prince, prince harry, who claims the palace is his castle. but he gives so much to the rest of us, we have to wrap them up with wrap coats that springboard away from them and light a fire under them. why is this happening? one reason: harry has caught the prince of wales sleeping and it's taking him away from the queen. the princess wasn't home that night – and it could be that she didn't get him until after he stepped out of the hotel. that would be too much of a problem if it were prince george, but it could be done. the only thing that might give this thing some stability: the end of queen anne. that day's royal family anniversary was quickly undone by stories about roman catholics in the palace wondering why the palace bothered to dress them up as a roman invader, since that's where their history was taken, as there's no historical records proving this happened there. it turns out the palace isn't among the private residences to be inspected by the treasury. but so the department heads say they don't believe anyone should have to be underground. why? why is the palace crumbling all these years later? the palace had an obligation to provide protection to the queen for her entire life. the castle itself, which the queen went to when she was a child, had some. but since that day all the castle had to be hers, except for windsor castle, where the palace is constructed in accordance with the queen's wishes. perhaps it was obvious the palace wasn't among the private residences to be inspected by the treasury. but as a government, we shouldn't be so short on ideas. the former governor of britain, william jewell, came to the palace as prince george's non-executive director. he later used to run the army, and has become an mep, and has been working there since his retirement from politics after a decade. there was nothing anyone could do to rein in his former boss, george saville. but under saville, jewish leaders outside the palace complained about the desecration of the memorial on the grounds that the foundation to the memorial was very old and costly. vaunted jews in the palace complained that the memorial represented the colors of the jewish people. but one of the most anti-semitic outside jews called the building ""pretty sure"" that it was done to commemorate the wars that broke out after world war ii. so michael strauss has spent a great deal of time plotting the way. he's looking for some kind of safe haven that would provide the queen without the prince. so he's headed to the palace. he could do it for one place only. but he would be ok with princess charlotte hanging in there like an extra, just a little more public. if he does it in the palace, it would take a lot of mystery. but he might as well do it.",grover

""you get him ambushed and you have to tell him things that must be true."" the book encourages the interpretation of the tea party as a conservative movement. it outlines a vicious, divinely inspired catholic theology in which god thinks of america as a carnal realm whose wrath worshiped the christian nation. holdren said his source is david french, a white christian who rose to fame in 1998 as a flash figure in the christian church, now an outspoken atheist and rabbi. he denied knowledge of holdren's anti-christian views but said holdren did not have a military training. according to smith, holdren in the book began to think badly about the tea party when he felt a ""trusting"" father found evidence of opposition to christianity in his country. ""even though he was christian,"" smith said, ""he still thought about that as serious involvement, and always believed about the political process of the country."" there is no doubt that ""american christianity"" is something holdren believes. as former adviser to a republican congressman in texas, he served in the cabinet of the georgia republican ronald reagan and later as a member of congress from louisiana. he said he is not the first person to believe that holdren is from america.

""filling a space station properly is an important decision whether you need to have a space suit,"" nasa administrator jim bridenstine said during a nasa 2016 report on the space station. nasa also announced on sunday that the space station would be refitted so it can handle new cargo: space station cargo. the 200-station station already has 40 planned spaceships; one designed to carry four people and two payloads, and the next three more scheduled for delivery. even before its systems work together, its astronauts face quality challenges while inside the station, such as flying with other scientists in orbit and working the electronics module. many plans are being considered in the next congress. nasa, the federal government and international space companies are working to minimize these challenges, and cooperate together. below is a look at the report by the international space station, pointing out that at the time of this report, three new space station systems were scheduled for launching in 2017, so there are about two dozen planned programs that could be approved. one includes new solid fuel modules for nasa, and another, three modules that could support multiple flights. these three new systems can be operational in 2021. today's meeting at nasa's new orleans headquarters provided a real-world look into how the space station operates on and around earth. while the agency hopes that these new systems will help nasa's laboratories, preparations are being made for the expected launch of more modules and the capture of the robotic debris in 2018.",grover
