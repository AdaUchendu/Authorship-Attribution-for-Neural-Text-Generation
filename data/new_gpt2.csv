62,"'onward' continues pixar's apparent quest to make us cry. a lot of people have been arguing about how pixar is breaking the fourth wall with their movies, but it seems like the studio is doing it to the point where it's more than just an act of theatrics. in fact, the studio seems to be building an entire mythology around it. it's hard to know what to make of this, but i guess it's not surprising. after all, a lot of people are afraid of what they don't understand. in 'onward' (which is directed by michael de luca, who also co-wrote 'inside out') the main character, riley, is faced with a choice: stay with her family, or go to college. riley's mother, claire, wants riley to stay, but her father, stan, is against it. the movie's hero, riley, is a high school student who is trying to figure out who she is, and what she wants to do with her life. the film follows riley's journey through a series of flashbacks and reveals a number of interesting facts about riley's life. for example, riley's mother is named claire, and her father is named stan. the movie also reveals that riley's father is married to the daughter of a woman named anna, who is the mother of riley's best friend, sadie. the plot of 'onward' is pretty straightforward, but there are some interesting twists to it. in one scene, we see a scene from riley's childhood that is very similar to the scene in 'inside out' where she is forced to go to a party that her mother doesn't want her to go to. the scene also shows a scene from her childhood that is very similar to the scene in 'inside out' where she goes to a party that her father doesn't want her to go to. i think that's a pretty interesting twist on the film, and i'm really looking forward to seeing how it plays out. the film has a great cast, including will arnett, john c. reilly, and maya rudolph. arnett is definitely the standout of the cast, as he plays the role of riley's best friend, sadie. rudolph plays sadie's mother, and she's a really nice character. she's very funny and smart, and she's also very protective of sadie. she has some dark moments in the film, and i think it's important",gpt2

""this is a very exciting finding, because it shows that genetic mutations can cause a heart attack in a non-genetic way, and that we can find new treatments for the patients who have the disease."" ""i think it's going to open the door to a whole new class of treatments,"" said dr. robert schleicher, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the university of pennsylvania school of medicine. the genetic mutation, called aba, has been identified in a small number of patients with congenital heart disease, a group of disorders that include heart failure, heart disease and congenital heart defects. about 1 in 100,000 people have the condition, and about 1 in 2,000 people will die from it, according to the american heart association. in most cases, patients with aba do not have heart disease, but the condition can occur in people who have heart failure or congenital heart disease. the heart attack can be triggered by a sudden change in blood pressure, or by a clot in the heart, which can also trigger a heart attack. the study involved eight patients with congenital heart disease who were not diagnosed with heart disease. all the patients underwent surgery to separate their hearts and have their hearts replaced with artificial valves. the researchers found that four of the eight patients had aba in the genetic code. the patients were all of european ancestry. two of the patients were treated with a drug that blocks the gene that makes aba. the drug was taken for two years before the researchers looked at the patients' heart function. in those patients who had aba, their heart function did not improve. in other patients, the drug treatment made no difference.

599,"eat more plants and less meat to live longer and improve heart health, study suggests we all know that eating meat is bad for our health, but what about the effect of eating meat on our heart? a new study has found that people who eat less meat live longer, and that eating more plants may help keep us healthier. the study, published in the journal the american journal of clinical nutrition, suggests that eating more plants, which contain less saturated fat, may be good for heart health. the researchers looked at more than a thousand people, all of whom had been diagnosed with heart disease. the participants were divided into two groups: those who ate the most plant-based diet, and those who ate less plant-based diet. the researchers found that the plant-based diet group had a mean lifespan of 45.3 years compared with 35.1 years for the non-plant-based diet group. ""the primary reason we know that meat consumption is associated with mortality is because of its association with cardiovascular disease,"" said the study's lead author, dr. robert s. lustig, an associate professor of medicine at harvard medical school. ""we don't know why. there's a lot of evidence that suggests that eating more plant-based diets may help prevent cardiovascular disease, but it's not clear why."" lustig and his colleagues believe that the difference in lifespan is because of the plant-based diet group's lower intake of saturated fat. ""saturated fat is linked to coronary heart disease, and we know that saturated fat has a direct effect on blood pressure and cholesterol,"" lustig said. ""there is some evidence that eating less saturated fat may improve heart health, but it's not clear why."" the researchers found that eating more plants had a beneficial effect on heart health. they found that the plant-based diet group had a mean decrease in blood pressure of 0.5mm hg. a similar drop in blood pressure was found in people who ate the least plant-based diet. the plant-based diet group also had a mean decrease in cholesterol of 0.3mm hg. ""what we found is that eating more plant-based diets is associated with a lower risk of mortality,"" lustig said.

""it's not a coincidence that the ocean is warming."" in fact, the ocean is warming about 1.5 degrees fahrenheit per decade. that's far faster than the rate of global warming seen in the past. in other words, we're in a dangerous situation, and the planet is rapidly warming. as one climate expert told davenport, ""if the planet is warming faster than the atmosphere, then we can expect to see more storms, more hurricanes, more intense storms, and more extreme weather events."" the good news is that there's a solution. we don't need to worry about a return of the super-storms that plagued the early 2000s, because the planet is warming faster than the atmosphere, and we're going to be able to stop the warming before it's too late. ""we can get the climate system back to a place where it can deal with climate change,"" field said. ""and we can do that by using our ingenuity and our technology to be more efficient."" more from morning mix dodger stadium will be the home of the dodgers for the next 15 years. it's not clear when.

""i have no idea."" but that's not true. the fbi has been investigating the trump campaign for months, and it's looking at whether or not there were any violations of election laws in connection with trump's campaign. but it has not found any evidence that trump or his campaign knowingly broke the law. according to the washington post, the fbi has been investigating trump's campaign for months, and it has not found any evidence that trump or his campaign knowingly broke the law. in fact, the fbi is investigating the trump campaign because of the fact that the campaign was caught on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women. but trump has been talking about the investigation since before he even launched his campaign, and he's been making comments about it since before the fbi even started its investigation. here's a sampling of some of trump's comments about the investigation: ""they're going to say it was a rigged election. that's what they're going to say."" — during a rally in greenville, south carolina on march 22, 2016 ""look, the election is rigged. i'm going to win, and i'm going to win big. and we're going to win big."" — during a rally in greenville, south carolina on march 22, 2016 ""i'm the least racist person that you have ever met."" — during a rally in greenville, south carolina on march 22, 2016 ""i will tell you, i have a running war with the media. you know, they are the most dishonest people in america, ok? they are the most dishonest people, the worst. they are the most dishonest people."" — during a rally in greenville, south carolina on march 22, 2016 ""i have no idea what i'm doing. i have no idea what i'm doing. i don't know what's going on. they're going to say it was a rigged election. that's what they're going to say."" — during a rally in greenville, south carolina on march 22, 2016 ""i have no",gpt2

(opinion) the numbers are in, and the results are in: in the first quarter of 2017, americans spent nearly $3.3 trillion on holiday gifts. this is the highest amount of holiday spending in history, and the fourth highest in the last 20 years. the increase in holiday spending is due to the economic recovery, and the fact that americans are spending more on holidays than they did prior to the recession. the economy is doing great, and americans are spending money on more than ever before. there is some good news in the holiday spending numbers. the increase in spending is not large enough to generate a significant increase in the number of people who are not working. according to the bureau of labor statistics, the number of americans who are not working has been steadily increasing since the start of the recession. in fact, the number of people who are not working has been at or near its lowest point in the last decade. the following chart shows the percentage of americans who are not working, which peaked at about 58% in 2007 and has now dropped to around 47%. source: bureau of labor statistics the percentage of americans who are not working has dropped because the economy has been growing, and fewer americans are being employed. in addition, the economy has been improving since the recession, which means that americans are spending more money on holidays. according to the bureau of economic analysis, the economy has been growing at a much faster rate than the number of people who are not working. in the first quarter of 2017, the economy added more than 200,000 jobs. the chart below shows the percentage of jobs created during the first quarter of 2017. source: bureau of economic analysis this is good news for the economy. it means that the economy has been growing, and more jobs have been created. the following chart shows the percentage of jobs created during the first quarter of 2017. source: bureau of labor statistics while this is good news for the economy, the growth in jobs is not as great as the amount of money that americans are spending on holidays. according to the bureau of labor statistics, the unemployment rate increased to 7.7% in the first quarter of 2017. this is the highest rate of unemployment since the recession. the following chart shows the percentage of americans who are unemployed, which peaked at about 10% in 2007. source",gpt2
791,"is the first amendment safe from donald trump? the first amendment is a core component of our democracy. it guarantees that the government does not censor speech or restrict it because of its political views. it is a cornerstone of our national character and our constitutional system. the supreme court has repeatedly recognized that the first amendment protects the right of citizens to speak their minds and to petition the government for redress of grievances. the first amendment's protection of free speech does not mean that the government cannot punish those who are found guilty of violating it. when the government seeks to punish speech that is protected by the first amendment, it must show that the speech is itself the subject of a specific threat. this means that the government must show that the speaker's speech is a direct and imminent threat to the safety of the government or others. the government must also show that the speech is likely to incite imminent lawless action, such as violence. if the government cannot prove this, the speech cannot be punished. for example, in the 1993 case of planned parenthood v. casey, the supreme court held that a government cannot punish an individual for distributing a pamphlet that warned about the dangers of abortion. planned parenthood v. casey is one of the most important cases in the history of the first amendment. the pamphlet warned about the dangers of abortion, but it did not incite imminent lawless action. the government cannot punish the individual who distributed the pamphlet, but it can punish the speech that was the subject of the pamphlet. in this case, the government cannot punish the speech that was the subject of the pamphlet because it does not show that the speech was a direct and imminent threat to the safety of the government or others. it also cannot punish the speech that was the subject of the pamphlet because the pamphlet was distributed in a private setting and the government did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the speech. in a case called smith v. maryland, the supreme court held that the government cannot punish an individual who distributed a bumper sticker that criticized the state of maryland for the treatment of prisoners. in smith v. maryland, the supreme court held that the bumper sticker did not incite imminent lawless action. the government cannot punish the individual who distributed the bumper sticker because it did not show that the bumper sticker was a direct and imminent threat to the safety of the government or others. it also cannot punish the speech",gpt2

793,"here is when each generation begins and ends, according to facts"" by william h. white the following is a revised and updated version of ""when each generation begins and ends, according to facts"" by william h. white, published in the july-august 1964 issue of the american prospect. the past four decades have been a time of historic changes in american society. for most of the 20th century, the american people were relatively affluent, well-educated, and politically engaged. yet in the early part of the 20th century, the american people were becoming increasingly politically divided. these developments can be explained in part by the changes that occurred in the american economy between the great depression and world war ii. but the main cause of the political polarization in the 1960s was the role of the television industry in shaping american politics. by the 1960s, television had become the dominant medium for the american people to access information. the technology that had been developed for the television industry—the camera, the microphone, and the television set—had become available to the public at the same time that television was becoming the dominant medium for the american people to receive information. the result was a dramatic increase in the number of television viewers and the number of television programs that were broadcast. tv began to dominate the american public's understanding of the world around them. in the 1960s, television was the most widely watched medium in the united states. and the number of television programs that were broadcast was greater than any other medium. by the mid-1960s, television had become the dominant medium for the american people to receive information. the use of television as the dominant medium for the american people to receive information was very effective. according to the television research and information center, by the mid-1960s, ""tv was the most-watched medium in the united states. it was the only medium in which more people watched the news on television than listened to it."" but the ability of television to influence the american public was not unlimited. a growing number of americans were becoming increasingly frustrated with television. they were increasingly frustrated with the political discourse in the country. they were becoming frustrated with the political discourse in the country. these were not the sentiments of the 1960s. the 1960s were a time when americans were very concerned about their country's economic condition and the political condition of their country. the 1960s were a time when the american people were very concerned about their",gpt2

795,"baby boomers: five reasons they are our worst generation,"" in the october issue of the atlantic. by tim murphy the most amazing thing about this new pew research center study of the baby boomers is that it is not a partisan study. of the 3,800 people who were asked about the most important thing about their generation, nearly three-quarters — 2,360 — cited ""career opportunity"" as the most important. the next most important reason? ""family,"" which was cited by 1,300. and what about those who say they are ""completely"" or ""moderately satisfied"" with their lives? nearly a quarter of those polled, or 16 percent, cited ""career opportunity"" as their most important reason for their satisfaction. the other reason cited was ""family."" all of this suggests that the generation is likely to continue to have high levels of satisfaction, as it did in the early 1990s, when it was the most satisfied generation in the nation. but it is worth noting that the millennials — the generation born between 1980 and 2000 — are less satisfied than the baby boomers, who were born between 1946 and 1964. this is because, as the pew research center notes, millennials are more likely to be unmarried. and this is likely to be the case for a long time, as the pew research center notes that the median age of people who are currently living with their parents is now 33 years old. the pew research center's findings also suggest that millennials are less likely to be satisfied with their current job. the survey found that 53 percent of millennials are dissatisfied with their job. that is down from 65 percent of boomers, and it is also down from 68 percent of gen xers. this is a problem for the job market, because millennials are more likely to be looking for a new job. the job market is still very much in need of millennials, but there is a possibility that the generation could be a bit too old to find a job. the pew research center's findings are based on interviews with 1,800 people. the results are based on the question: ""in the past 12 months, how satisfied are you with your job?"" it is important to note that the question does not ask respondents if they are satisfied with their current job. if that is what they say, then they are not being honest. the survey",gpt2

""there's a lot of mystery surrounding this animal. there are a lot of people who think cecil was a lion, and it's a mistake to think otherwise."" cecil the lion was killed on feb. 1. the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission said the lion was killed by a large, long-horned african lion. as a result of this killing, the agency is now investigating whether the killing was in compliance with the federal endangered species act. the agency is also asking the public to submit a comment on whether or not they think the killing was in compliance with the act. srnicek says that while the commission has been investigating the killing, they've received very few comments. ""we don't know how many people have looked at the story,"" he says. ""but it's pretty much a blank canvas."" that's because the agency doesn't have the authority to shut down a website or take action against someone who posts an image of a lion's body. ""we're not asking for a criminal investigation or any criminal charges,"" srnicek says. ""we're just asking for the public to provide input on whether or not this was in compliance with the endangered species act."" but there's a big problem with this approach: it's not enough to simply put a link to a website on the agency's website. the agency has to actively monitor it.

""we need to be looking at that website and making sure it's actually helping us do our job."" so, the agency is looking at whether or not the website is being used to solicit donations for the lion's fund.

814,"why can't america have high-speed trains? they're just too expensive. it's a good question. the short answer is that the federal government doesn't have the money. the longer answer is that the federal government doesn't have the political will to do anything about it. the biggest hurdle to high-speed rail is the cost of doing it right. it's the problem that has been most frustrating to rail advocates, who have been trying for decades to bring a rail system to the country. the answer, of course, is to build it right. that's why it's so important to understand the economics of high-speed rail. the basics of the federal government's role in the high-speed rail program are pretty simple. the federal government is supposed to provide a portion of the cost of building and operating a high-speed rail line. the money comes from a few sources. the federal government is supposed to match state and local government contributions to the project, and it also pays for the construction of the line. the federal government also helps pay for the management of the project, and the train service. so what's the difference between these two sources of funding? the federal government pays for the line. that's it. the federal government doesn't have to build the line, or pay for it. the state or local government is. why is that important? because the federal government can't be held responsible for the poor performance of a high-speed rail line. that's because the federal government has a different obligation to the nation than the state or local governments do. the federal government has a responsibility to the entire country, not just to the people who live in its jurisdiction. the federal government also has a responsibility to the people who work in the nation's rail system. that's why the federal government has spent billions of dollars on modernizing the nation's rail system over the years. the federal government has also spent billions of dollars on the development of infrastructure and transportation in the nation's cities and towns. the federal government also has a responsibility to the nation's highway system, which is largely funded by the federal government. the federal government has a responsibility to the nation's transportation system, not just to the people who live in the nation's jurisdictions. in short, the federal government has a responsibility to the entire country",gpt2

818,"why more women choose not to marry in india than in any other country is because of the lack of a social contract, a tradition that says that the husband must return to his family. ""in india, a man can stay in his wife's house for as long as he wants,"" says shanti devi, a feminist activist and writer. ""he doesn't have to ask permission. but he can't go back to his wife's home."" according to dr. shyam sundararajan, a retired professor of sociology at the university of hyderabad, the rise of divorce is a direct result of the women's movement in the 1990s. ""women were very keen to change the social contract and to get equal rights for them, and they did,"" he says. ""but the movement did not take root in the home, and even though it was taking root, the system remained intact."" feminists argue that the system is broken because it fails to protect women from domestic violence, which has become a big problem in the last two decades. ""men and women are different, and if you try to make them the same, they will not accept it,"" says subramanian swamy, a lawyer and founder of the bharatiya janata party. ""the system has to be changed to make men and women equal."" in india, the current system of inheritance is a big reason for the high divorce rate, says dr. sundararajan. ""you have to give a lot of money to your children in order to get a divorce. that is not a good system,"" he says. ""if you give a woman a house, she will want to live there. she will give up the family business. but if you give a man a house, he will stay in it. he will not want to leave it."" in india, women have always had to earn more than men in order to be able to marry. ""men were always in the field, and women were in the house,"" says ms. sundararajan. ""it was very unfair."" the disparity between the sexes in divorce is also partly because women are more likely to be poor than men.

977,"super tuesday: why didn't more young people vote? the 2012 presidential election has been an exercise in gerrymandering. and yet, as election day approaches, it's still a mystery as to why so many young people are voting for republican candidates. the republicans have used their control of state legislatures to push through a series of voting restrictions. some of the most egregious are voter id laws that require voters to present certain forms of identification in order to vote. these laws disproportionately affect young people of color and young people who don't have a college degree. the impact of these laws is clear: voter turnout among young people is down. in ohio, where a republican-controlled legislature is considering a strict voter id law, the number of young people voting in 2012 fell by 3.2 percent, according to the brennan center for justice, a think tank focused on voting rights and democracy. in florida, the number of young people who voted fell by 4.5 percent. in north carolina, the number of young people who voted fell by 5.1 percent. ""these laws are designed to suppress turnout among young people,"" says meredith kelly, a senior staff attorney at the brennan center. voter id laws, kelly says, are ""a tool of the republican party to prevent young people from participating in the political process."" young people are especially likely to be poor and are more likely to live in minority communities. they're also more likely to be young, and more likely to be female, and more likely to be poor than older people. these factors make it easier for republicans to win elections, says gregory smith, a political science professor at the university of pennsylvania. ""they can rely on young people to vote for them, and they can also get away with it because there is no way to check if they are actually eligible to vote,"" smith says. but young people are increasingly aware of their rights, and more likely to vote. ""i think there is a lot of disenchantment with the political system, and there is a lot of anger about the lack of economic opportunity,"" says charles franklin, a senior research associate at the public religion research institute. ""young people are going to be the largest voting block in this election,"" franklin says. as the election approaches, it's a good time to start thinking about how to increase voter turnout among young people. there are many ways to do that",gpt2
