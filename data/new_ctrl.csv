2,"coronavirus disinformation creates challenges for china's government beijing – the chinese government's efforts to contain a deadly new virus that has killed more than 100 people in recent months have been hampered by an unusually high number of false reports about the virus, which is known as sars. but officials say they are trying hard not only with their own warnings but also through public relations and education campaigns aimed at discouraging panic among residents -- especially those who work or study abroad from getting infected. in addition, health authorities say, many doctors report patients suffering symptoms consistent with, if not, identical to, signs found on other patients. that suggests there may be some overlap between cases reported here last week and, perhaps, others elsewhere around china. and it raises questions over whether china will face another outbreak like its previous one, when nearly 200 were infected before being isolated this year. we cannot afford any repeat performance, said dr. jiang yue, deputy director general medical affairs bureau under health ministry. he spoke after meeting monday morning president hu jintao. we're doing everything we can so no one gets infected. mr. hu, speaking during his annual news conference, called such outbreaks 'a major threat' because most victims recover without complications. [new york times, 11/21/2001] yet even though he acknowledged these risks, beijing continues press releases warning citizens against traveling overseas while waiting out potential cases. officials note that, despite widespread misreporting, few foreigners get sick here. a survey released earlier today showed fewer foreign tourists visiting shanghai since sept. 11. despite this, travel agencies continue offering discounts ranging up 40 percent off regular prices. some travelers stay away until dec. 31. most popular destinations include hong kong, taiwan, thailand, thailand malaysia singapore, malaysia, south korea, japan taiwan indonesia india indonesia, vietnam, australia mexico vietnam philippines canada brazil germany france italy spain russia greece turkey singapore chile argentina saudi arabia iraq egypt pakistan kuwait israel norway colombia iran north korea afghanistan africa ethiopia libya nigeria mongolia myanmar bangladesh ukraine poland syria eritrea sudan somalia venezuela peru congo mali tanzania sweden switzerland united states austria belgium portugal ecuador sri lanka zimbabwe yemen cuba honduras uganda kenya oman tunisia slovenia ireland serbia slovakia bulgaria albania laos angola sierra leone senegal ghana zambia swaziland mozambique malawi niger togo kazakhstan bolivia guatemala romania rwanda namibia bhutan cambodia jordan kosovo macedonia cameroon liberia algeria lithuania maldives nepal burma belarus uzbekistan turkmenistan uruguay costa rica panama samoa suriname gabon guinea botswana croatia montenegro paraguay lesotho haiti armenia georgia latvia netherlands moldova kyrgyzstan tajikistan qatar lebanon burundi burkina faso iceland cyprus estonia luxembourg san marino liechtenstein djibouti dominican republic el salvador timor le tchad usa belize nicaragua democratic republikovarab 11 countries sao tome au viet nam afrique du sud saint kitts & principe timor-lituation de la république tanzanie cambodyweight en europe et palau. il",ctrl
3,"china coronavirus: eating wild animals made illegal but ending the trade won't be easy. a new study says that while there are no direct links between eating meat and contracting sars, it is possible to get infected by consuming contaminated meat. the researchers say they have found evidence of a link with consumption from pigs in china. but this could not explain why people who had eaten pork were more likely than others -- including those without symptoms or even healthy eaters like me - caught it. so we may need further research on how much exposure each person has been exposed to. in any case, it's important for consumers here at home as well if they're going out into public places where raw meats might come in. we should also consider whether our own food supply would contain enough bacteria resistant to, say, e. coli o157:h7 so someone can eat something that's potentially dangerous. if not, then perhaps you shouldn't go out. and i hope everyone else does. i'm sure many other americans feel exactly same way. you don't want your health compromised. that's what we're all trying hard for. it's just unfortunate some folks will try anything over here. or maybe not. it doesn't matter. we're still doing everything right here, folks. just think about that. what do you think? do you? will yours? let us know below. i'll update my post when i've heard back again. until then, enjoy these delicious recipes (and let them stay warm!)... happy new year! -kim & michelle (@kimandmichelene) december 31, 2010 9:49 am pst follow up next week after thanksgiving day 2 : christmas eve 1, 2012 dec 1, 2013 12:53 pm est time to learn more: http://bit.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health/health-26597356239804/index.html? www.telegraph.co.uk/gp.../ read more "" health room | health blog archive ""why doesn't work today |blogs: how doctors & science friday 6 hours ago 5 days before reading an article last night 4 january 23, 23 jan 8, 2011 february 16, 2009 by robert f. michael moore was wrong 2005 this week, scientists said yesterday morning april 3, 2008's latest medical science day 3 minutes ago... when did nothing new. last month death row 8 years ago, march 5, 2007 may 6, 2003 scientists claim 9 months ago. today marks two weeks later on. that year ; 19 october 22, 2006 20 june 18, 2014 monday 17 august 25, 2004 feb 20, 2017 10 november 25 september 11 years later, it's now 16 dec. 29, 2015 world news 24 hours since sept. 29 july 13, 2016 national geographic , science, which came yesterday. with his book review – jan. 9, 2002 there seems quite soon become nov. 13 apr 12, 2009. while most recent history dr. david cameron et al. all three",ctrl

25,"why the impact of coronavirus could be particularly bad on college campuses is unclear, but it has been linked to a number health problems in people who have had contact with infected animals, including those that may carry sars or other viruses. in addition, dr. frieden said, there are concerns about how quickly an infection can spread from person a through animal reservoirs and whether students might not get enough time between exposure before becoming ill. the virus was first found among camels at saudi arabian farms last year, he said. it then appeared as far away -- perhaps across oceans by way of, say, hong kong or, perhaps, new york city - where several cases were reported this year. there also appears little reason for concern because most patients recover quickly, said peter hotez, director general emeritus medical officer responsible for, respectively, public health, epidemiology & surveillance division (epidemiology) within who. we don't know if it's going over long distances, mr. hoft told reporters. we're still looking into that. he added later: 'it's possible we haven't seen all these cases.' but even though only one case so far, involving two university students, seems likely right now, who officials say they will continue monitoring both countries closely. they plan another meeting next month when experts discuss what should happen next. and while some scientists believe such viruses do cause more serious illness than previously thought, others disagree. one expert says his own research shows no evidence linking any particular strain like mers-cov directly to, you know, swine flu, which killed thousands around christmas 2001. other researchers think there's plenty here too. for example, here's why many universities ban their animals during flu season: because influenza kills up until symptoms appear after getting sick means dead ones first. so what's happening now would seem unlikely. what does kill them first? how much less important? is h1n1 virus, that's all. influenza strains usually die off humans make good medicine work better since its effects become worse virus itself makes us well just isn't always gets stronger later on. some studies show strong yet vaccine works best known h5none. what's really doesn't mean higher doses often turn out there. this year's pandemic vaccines aren't very hard to help stop it. as soon follow up. why? just look similar viruses, especially high risk factors are few years ago got low numbers go down. could possibly due too big influenza. it's easy kill. there's something else ebola virus's main problem when someone come back again same disease i am sure is. after all, thanks maybe ebolsters tend to. on top priority no harm rates against human life threat. that study suggests need immediate threat depends upon them. or not. most recent years. if you're saying pandemics causes millions worldwide with epidemic influenza, respiratory diseases. we must act early bird virus. more information not everyone who knows why. like",ctrl
26,"diplomat at the un tests positive for coronavirus a diplomat from a country that has been hit by an outbreak of sars was tested yesterday in new york and found to have antibodies against one strain -- but not another one. the diplomat, who is also infected with ebola, had no symptoms when he returned home after being admitted on sept. 19. he will be monitored closely over coming days before returning home. but it appears unlikely his condition would prompt him or anyone else here immediately into quarantine. instead, officials are considering whether they should allow people like him, whose exposure could pose risks if caught while traveling outside their countries, back onto american soil. if so, many experts say this approach might prove more effective than isolating them here. if you isolate them, you're going down two paths, said dr. peter piot, director general emeritus de la world health organization. you're either giving up your rights as citizens here, which i think we shouldn't do, because then you've just created kind of, what amounts to, second-class citizens. in other words, treating patients without first making sure they're safe enough elsewhere may create new problems later. and it's unclear how long such measures can last. there were already signs last week that, even though some countries seemed ready now only weeks ago under pressure about possible contagion, others did not. on monday, france announced plans today (nyti.ms/1s2y4u) aimed specifically at, among others, china. it called upon china 'to take all necessary measures' so its health authorities do everything needed both domestically and, potentially, abroad. that means stopping travelers arriving through air travel within china, hong kong until further afield, since mid-october, according china's ministry spokesman said. meanwhile, britain urged britons flying out there, saying there must return home, warning those visiting london residents go straight there. officials insist there's nothing short notice. as news emerged earlier monday morning reports surfaced suggesting british airways passengers leaving heathrow airport reported flights canceled flights, including connecting london, where several times between aug. 22. at least four airlines across europe warned americans heading overseas flight cancellations tuesday, u.s. airlines confirmed tuesday afternoon says united states airport arrival boston airports wednesday july 20 percent report 12 june 18 brussels airports association announces quarantine orders ordered sunday march 8 may 10 us centers closed oct. 1, 9 los angeles international airports, european union pacific coast guard order strict screening guidelines 13 april 1 florida 15 august 16 ports san francisco dulles airport, chicago o'hare 23 february 11 california 31 january 26 september 7 mar 6 cancun source indicates most affected cdc calls homeland security agency warns three cities washington dc 3 detroit lax e december 28 massachusetts 2 mexico city 19 port authority feb. 17 november 2012 30 october 25 27 national center la guardia 21 texas 5 oct 2011 paris 4 -",ctrl

34,"the movies that predicted an outbreak like coronavirus in the united states were all made before sept. 11. the movie industry is not going to be able to, as a matter of fact, prevent this from happening again, said dr. david l. heymann, who directs infectious disease research at columbia university. we're talking about something that's already been around for 10 years. he added, however, that, if it did happen, he would expect some sort or combination -- including people with flu-like symptoms and others whose immune systems had failed them because they got sick during sars outbreaks elsewhere. but there was no evidence so far suggesting such complications, according his team. and while many scientists are still trying hard on their own theories explaining why humans can get infected by viruses other than influenza, none have yet come up against anything resembling what happened here. even so, public health experts say it's clear we need better ways both now and, more important, later on. in particular, doctors should keep patients informed when someone has become ill after getting infected. they also must take steps immediately afterward whenever possible even though infections might seem mild enough just now. if you do catch it, make sure your doctor knows how serious you're feeling. this means asking questions like, are my fever levels high now? is i having trouble breathing? do any medicines help me? what else could cause me these symptoms? finally, don't wait until you've gotten better. it may turn out worse rather quickly. it's important right away now, but once infection sets in, say, two weeks later. that way, too, since most likely will give us time enough. so let's start thinking ahead now! you won't hurt you. think ahead. that's where we're going. you're probably right. we can't wait. then we'll know what's coming next week. we'll know. they'll tell us. when they're not. now there's nothing else. maybe one week away. let's think fast. one thing is, we've known it.. they're really good luck there. there isn't much sooner then they'll go back then. because our best way back. after all, here again. for example, maybe three months ago. by then, let alone soon. a few weeks. just six months. there's only last year. as soon after. why didn't happen. an american people, which came down into new york city. what's that? not too much. people began being safe. yet again very early. two years ago yesterday. on march 2001 became late april 2006. three years. which ones too. no reason why. october 2001. july 20 percent year ago, early july. september 2001, february 2003 date january 2005 first. most americans always seems unlikely. may 2003. since 2002, 2004 june 2004. 2006 december 2002 first day before. to date. now, those four million cases occur between them. of course, january, 2005. all over all. these days. very little bit earlier today. they've never quite late. august 2002. before that. don't begin earliest found",ctrl

( amzn - news -- people ) which sells music for $9.99 or less per download. and even though itunes sales are growing fast, they have yet to match those of rival services such as microsoft's windows media player software. last week, microsoft announced plans this week tosell video players through retail stores by year's end. in addition, disney expects revenue from dvd rentals will grow about 20 percent annually over three years. that means more money could be spent developing new content than ever before. if all goes well, though, analysts say disney's movie business may become one reason why investors should buy shares today. it's not just going into movies, says robert iger, chairman emeritus walt disney. we're looking forward to, you know, doing other things besides film. indeed, mr. iger recently said he was optimistic his company's future would include television. disney, whose stock closed yesterday above $60, did well last year thanks largely because consumers were eager enough after years without film releases (aside from, perhaps, star wars) but unwilling (or unable) spend much time watching tv. this year, however, there seems little doubt that, once again, hollywood studios won't stop making movies. even if their profits fall short next year. shares rose $1.8125, closing friday morning before settling back down $2.125. on monday, when wall street had been expecting earnings estimates ranging between $1.50 billion dollars earned so far below expectations. as expected, many analysts' expectations call estimates. for now, it's hard data suggest there's no matter what percentage points seem optimistic. still, given how long term expectations: it's likely they'll get there. stocks & p/e minus earnings estimate coming out 12/31/31 1/14/20/21, ahead ratio = 1.56 vs. expected eps /2.35 11/32 ratio. a very high end 10/32, while analyst price target range range. it also suggests we expect 3.11 months 2/32. price paid 4/33 % change 29/34 3/16 times 16/31. price: 16.6 ytd amerits/h dividend.est. net income growth rate 8.22 december 2012 12/ high yield 0.13 09/15/32/18 year ended 9/28/23/22/23 2009 12.0 est. 10 13.3 2013 $ 5.75 pts. 1 mtarge 4.01 2011 11.00 cash flow 7/12 %. discounts 7.02 billion n margin: u.s. dollar gap 15.7 5/2 years earnings-13%rsi 12-month",ctrl

74,"one of india's biggest banks has been rescued by the government and is now trying to rebuild its reputation in a country where it was once seen as an enemy. the bank had suffered from poor management since mr. singh's bharatiya janata party came into power last year. it lost money for years before being bailed out with $4.5 billion -- about half what analysts say are needed at most indian banks. but that rescue did not restore confidence among investors or customers. last week, standard chartered said on monday that, despite efforts over several months during which nearly all employees were laid off, sales would be significantly lower than expected. its shares fell more sharply after that. this will have serious consequences if this goes on, ms. sethi said. she added she expected other lenders like united overseas bank (ub) might also face problems. in india, many foreign companies depend heavily upon local banks, particularly those backed up against their own balance sheets. many large corporations rely too much solely on, say, deposits made through american express cards issued under license agreements between visa inc. (v.n) and, well, visa. as india struggles economically, these businesses may find themselves unable even though they can pay back loans quickly because there simply aren't enough customers left who want them. that could mean trouble when business slows down later on. and while some economists believe interest rates should rise soon, others think higher borrowing costs make such increases unlikely. even so, people here expect them eventually to. a survey published yesterday found only 9 percent support raising rates. another recent plans include lowering corporate tax rates, but no new taxes except indirect taxes, cutting spending cuts. some economists, including one way beyond current projections suggest otherwise. for example, citigroup, credit suisse first boston consulting estimates annual growth next year end 2013 revenue target rate cut targets range around 7 percent. to date, july 31, 2010. analysts polled analysts' expectations run 3 percent, according to10 % increase earnings per cent off 25 basis point estimated 30 - 1 million people. with 5 billion rupees ($). revenue ratio 20 %. 2 trillion dollars ( bse $ 7.05 %100 million usd 1.06 crore rupee) = us$ 500 bn us$3.62.5 billion. this means total assets 250 billionaiishares rose 0.75 bn / share market cap 1.5 trillions : $2.6 billions. ing 258.15 milliard cr $1.4 milliards de 2.80 billions 200 million. source: thomson reuters research firm ubs & co p/e m market cap 350 000 points -1.627 p&#s 50 mil us dollar index based value 125 150 mil, forbes 400 billionsnd net assets 600 mkt 35 bp 300 trillion dollar yen 100b 12 0 750 mln share price p&l 50,000,000,000",ctrl

78,"india has an increasingly global perspective on beauty -- but the patriarchy still looms large in indian culture. i don't think there is a single woman who doesn't have her own personal style, said ms. patkar, whose first collection of clothes was inspired by bollywood films. women are very much part and parcel to their families. they dress for each other. you can't separate them. the women she works with wear traditional clothing like saris, kurtas or sarikas. but they also take advantage of, say, designer labels that offer them more freedom than ever before. in india, where fashion houses don't need as many designers because so few people buy clothes, it can be hard enough just keeping up appearances. to make things worse, most models come from india's lower classes, which means that, unlike western models, these girls often lack formal training and, therefore, cannot afford expensive clothes. and even if those outfits were made out there, what would indians really wear? most likely, no one will see them. instead, they'll go home wearing something simple or, at best, casual. this trend toward casual dressing may seem counterintuitive, since it's easier today simply buying cheap clothing. but, says mr. sharma, shopping around makes sense. he suggests looking through men's stores before you buy. if you're going into such stores, he says, try finding some items priced below $100. then look around. prices might drop further. or perhaps you'll find better deals elsewhere. or, perhaps, you'd rather pay less. it's all about choice. as long lines form outside stores. it seems strange when men wait until they've been waiting outside. for example, i am sure there's nothing wrong here. a lot here. that said, my friend said. she looked down there. there are, too. he's got his eyes did say this year. no matter how could be. we had never seen him dressed up. his face looks right. my wife sat down, he's dressed. her husband wore suits him. not only wears black suit. she's always goes on. who knows best. when we both came out. what does it. these two years ago told me off. so she's worn. now let's go. with him, then i'm glad they're gone. where else dresses dress. why didn't know this. two days gone by. how old age. all our feet worn her. that's why should wear. old age 50. one day after all. is old. there's another day. though now too young man went he. let's get older. three hundred years. from now. on her, that's new. while he, too, though we're young. we're in. because its past that. at least four year old, while older yet unfit. our way till then. first time away from. new york time. their hair hung off your head. yet so. young man's face. both together. men's past. since then, let us away. even so, what's new look. after all, love me. only left hand over her's. well, i'll tell me,",ctrl

[page a10.] but some experts say they believe all three strains have similar characteristics. in addition, two people who died from mers-cov were hospitalized after having contact with, but did not, come down sick because their illness appeared mild compared to, other cases. and scientists now know how common influenza viruses are. they can also see where these infections may spread. for example, according toâ u.s. officials, only about half those sickened by middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) last year went home within six weeks -- although many others returned home. if such cases occur again, health officials say, then new outbreaks could occur. influenza spreads through droplets like coughing, sneezing and, most important, close contact. it does so, too, when someone gets sick. a person might get flu symptoms while visiting friends or, even worse, during his trip abroad. so why do we think it's possible another outbreak will occur? because recent research shows what happens inside us affects us. when we're sick, certain cells called white blood cells, produce antibodies, which protect against infection. these antibodies help fight off invading viruses. antibodies work helps prevent infection. some researchers discovered recently found out there, too. that means you should go ahead your body produces its own immune system works better able cells. you need them off. to stop them. this way in, says that's good things happen outside you. now they're working well. we must work. it's important thing is, first make sure enough people, who knows what's going on. what's happening there. what happened since february 12, 23 hours before getting infected. that's very much needed action team members got caught up here today i don't want to. on january 17, april 28 days ago - 16 days. all over all, particularly high levels set up. as soon began testing december 1, health secretary frieden tion centers agency issued guidelines recommend measures sent him again now, yesterday announced yesterday. there's response plan call center. world health. how long term 2 billion dollar number 4 million americans die every day today. are already killed five thousand millions die. with that. may 30. june 8, 6 months ago. 3. two hundred million. their vaccines america epidemiologists warned yesterday, 30 percent mortality report tomorrow. 2. 10 years ago, sept. 23, 2002. united states department public health.",ctrl

( goog - news : * ), microsoft corp.

(even though i think that's exactly where ""the day after tomorrow""'s story takes place.) instead, many filmmakers choose instead of, say, ""we need someone who's going around telling stories others what's happening right now."" that is, ironically, often means they're doing something much less interesting than making things happen without ever did. for example, imagine this: if every day after, then go into some days ago now. they could take out there, no matter more. a lot fewer hours later, there's always seems far away. it's true enough, too many times three. it goes out. no longer matters. that's why, then, say 'cause everyday, another way out, right? when suddenly becomes tomorrow must be, too, i'm sure enough said. all those days, however, does not. then change that. just look back again. to me – what's wrong there. because each other. as long ago, now he's gone away all. there's nothing else. like my friend said one. is that? not always. do you? so, let's see now, its past it? there are, turn off him off. you're never mind you. with both ways. now let yourself apart from, don't ask me. where else 'til then. and, why? why? well, sometimes you've got caught them, when? they're gone. those who, can't stop it. at least once more, though, i'll tell me? these days. my friend, bring 'em all,",ctrl

189,"the truth about the white working class is that it has been a very stable group for most of its history. the people who have moved up from poverty are not necessarily those with college degrees, said robert rector, director and senior fellow at heritage. they're more likely to be men without any education or skills, often in jobs where they don't really know how much they're going make -- fast-food workers, construction workers. they tend toward low-wage jobs, like retail sales. he added that, on average, these workers earn less than $11,000 per year. in contrast, he said, black americans typically work longer hours but also receive higher wages. and while many blacks do well economically, mr. rector added, their wages lag behind whites by an average 15 percent. that gap can widen as long ago graduates move into higher-paying jobs. but even if there were no racial discrimination, this would still mean lower incomes among working-class blacks. according to census bureau data, only one percent fewer african-american households earned $20,000 last year compared with, say, 10 years ago. at least half will fall below $15,000 within five years. this means lower-income families may struggle just enough financially so they'll qualify under current programs designed primarily around helping low-income families. still, some economists say such programs, which provide cash payments when needed, could help lift millions out poverty. a new study suggests otherwise. it finds evidence suggesting poor children born during recessions end up, after college, earning slightly more. poverty rates rise sharply once economic conditions improve, especially since 1979. as ms. brown pointed out, it's hard sometimes impossible simply tell yourself you can't afford it. it's better off your own money. if you're trying to, then you've got nothing else too. that's why we're all too busy working. we need each other people. we're doing our best work. so we want everyone else. all right. i think that's what i'm sure we've done that. you know, because there's always get something good job is. we've never come together together. there's lots of. when things. let's keep them all. for us too, though, i've worked harder time here. some days gets me feel pretty well. there was my kids getting along time. on top down there. my wife works hard. not quite well, let's go through them. she doesn't seem to. what she says she's done. she's had her job. even though does not. her husband didn't stay home. is usually takes care about. most times he's gotten him out. then comes home three weeks off. with his family living paying. of course isn't much. because they've got. he's used up. no matter whether he'd pay for. since then. many things. one thing right now. these folks did find themselves down. people who've gone on. their parents take place now - let alone earns less. yet here today. every day. more money works. how far away some. maybe six months back home, though.",ctrl

[because] they believe trump represents their best hope at regaining control over what was once theirs."" that's why he's so worried right now. because donald trump, despite his racism, seems poised take power away form them. which is, uh, pretty scary. because, yes, that's right. a lot more scary than, say, barack obama. or bill clinton. or, god help us, hillary clinton!

201,"drug addiction: there is help for that. the drug problem has been a constant in the lives of many people here and throughout this country, but it was especially acute among black men because they were more likely to be arrested or imprisoned. it also affected young people, who often used drugs as an escape from their lives. some experts say that when blacks are incarcerated at higher rates than whites, there may well have something else going on -- like lower levels of, say, education or, especially, income. but no one knows exactly what role race plays here. and while some studies suggest racial disparities exist across all demographics, others find only modest differences. that suggests that, even if whites commit crimes with greater frequency, blacks, by contrast, don't. the fact is, we don't know why crime goes up disproportionately within certain groups, said dr. william j. bratton, new york city's police commissioner. we're not really sure how much racism contributes toward that. in any case, he said, most researchers believe poverty played little role. if anything, mr. bratton added, those factors could explain part rather then whole differences between arrest rates. he cited research showing poor neighborhoods had twice as, compared with, white neighborhoods. black neighborhoods, too, tended over time simply less policed and, therefore, far fewer arrests made. as such, professor wilson argues, these findings should make us rethink our assumptions about race. she believes she can show why. her new book, published last week, argues convincingly enough without resorting to, well, statistics. it's called race traitor, after all, although its subtitle says otherwise. for years, ms. wilson, now 66, studied criminal justice policy issues out west, where her focus mainly focusing primarily upon minority communities. now she's turned elsewhere. she's worked mostly outside washington, d.c., including stints teaching criminology classes around washington. with two years ago taught law enforcement issues. at harvard, harvard law school board member since 1985. has written books (he's done work related research. also teaches law, public health care work. is professor emeritus professor, university professor. a former president national center did several books, such as: criminal justice department research, clinical psychology department. past president bill clinton administration positions. public policy studies, boston university, boston, mass. state department, u.s. senate foreign service, u. s. james w. e. lawrence m. l. g. peter h. eugene a. michael t. wilson. what does not, other positions held by: institute of course, chicago, boston. other positions: director director, american society criminology, chicago crime prevention, office president, st. louis f. r. d. federal bureau of., columbia university. his book author: david b. economic, stanford university: no human nature. academic degrees johns hopkins univ. human rights office.

217,"no-deal brexit is back -- and it looks more likely than ever london — the british government on friday announced a plan to leave the european union without an agreement with its biggest trading partner, setting up another showdown between london politicians who want britain out of europe but fear losing their jobs if they stay in. but this time, there are signs that some senior ministers may be willing for negotiations even though prime minister theresa may has said she will not negotiate over britain's future relationship in europe. this could mean leaving both customs union membership (which would allow free movement from one country into another) as well as, potentially, eu membership. it also means staying part of, or at least paying into, existing international institutions like nato. if you think that's unlikely, just wait until next week. on march 29, when parliament returns after easter, mps must vote again whether parliament should remain within either customs union, which allows freedom across borders, or, alternatively, join nato (which, unlike customs, does not). that decision was supposed by law last year but, under pressure following brexit, now seems less certain. and while many pro-europeans have long argued that, since we don't actually need any new trade deals anyway, why bother negotiating them now, it's worth remembering how much damage being outside those arrangements did during world war ii. in 1939, germany had been defeated and, although hitler remained germany's leader, he didn't really control anything. he merely held power. as winston churchill put it: ""german policy can only change according to, what i call 'mein kampf' – my program ... my programme is, therefore, simply this: to make sure beforehand so far greater strength shall prevail against all attempts made upon us...."" that's hitler's famous phrase translated as: make your enemies stronger every time comes. it's hard enough already. we know exactly where our enemy is. | by nick clegg is boris johnson june 23, 2016 - bbc radio 4 min 19 jun 27, 2018 • david cameron 23 mins ago 22 hours ago, monday 20 minutes ago.mp3 july 4, 2017 jul 3, 2014 aug 2, 2015 12:12 hrs edt sunday, 6 pm, 2 days before sunday 1 day after two weeks ago. @bbc's first published his article about pm #eu27 sep 1, 5 mr april 28 mar 25, 2019 : http://t.coz o cnbcn uk s re tuesday 24 august 30, dj 07/23/12/24/7/2/27/9/28/10/6/22/5/21/05/03/25/11/30/8/31/06/20/07, 2010 1:40 2http://www.bbc today 23/ 19.07 13 9 hr 30 (23:22:00 hrs. thu 03 :-20/21 fri t 04/02/25 h 18 de en del 26 september 23. a little bit later 08/07 apr/8 e",ctrl

219,"the coronavirus has officials running the world from home in their offices and at home. but it is also a potent weapon that can be used against people who are not infected with it. in an effort to keep this virus out of africa, health workers have been spraying insecticides on crops before they ripen, then leaving them alone for several days. they hope these measures will prevent transmission by mosquitoes carrying sars or other viruses. as long as there were no signs among those infected, such precautions could work, dr. frieden said. but if you see any sign -- fever, headache, sneezing, nausea, vomiting '-- that's when we take action. he said he was confident about that. we're going into every situation where there's some kind of, let's say, risk factor, like high temperatures, low humidity, poor sanitation or, worst case, someone getting sick while trying desperately hard just enough food so his body does its job. and then, once again, he's ready again. this time, he'll use something more powerful than spraying. it won't kill all mosquitoes, but it's likely to, because even though most viruses don't survive long, many do. so far, though, only one person known outside africa had contracted ebola after being exposed through contact with, well, mosquitoes. that person, thomas eric duncan, died last week. his case illustrates how difficult finding cases is. most patients show up soon afterward, usually within two weeks. if you're lucky, you'll find one, too. one patient reported having symptoms three weeks later. another showed early symptoms. a third patient, nina pham, arrived four days later, tested negative five times over six months without showing she didn't have. she died. two others came back positive. three others, including mr. duncan himself. there may never did. with luck, maybe they'll get lucky. but, alas, none ever since sept. 11. because each time. that's what happens next.. it's too late. no matter where. all around now. what happened here today. we must wait until oct. 22. september. then we'll wait. or not. for now, then. to where? where do i think we'd better safe places where, next week, nov. 1. let us all. next week after, starting monday. i'll give me tomorrow. we'll see. there's still waiting. now what? will anyone else. do you? how much safer way out. why not? what's next? is our own way. can we? may 22 million americans need help. let's go ahead. who knows better. be ready. don't let him away. our work together. not now they're here. by aug. 10 years ago? too late year ago. when did they? are your best guess. you know what's next, day by. they're always first. maybe never. just put up. once again! take off them. come on. see you, can't come back. can't make sure would be. still waiting till september, september 1 a.m. new york city center. i'm sorry we're in. at least say so. first time off. u.s. government",ctrl

233,"europe travel ban: will it be possible to sneak into the us via the uk? the uk has a history of banning people from entering its territory for suspected terrorist activity, but this is likely only in extreme cases. a british citizen who had been convicted or imprisoned on terrorism charges could not enter britain if they were returning home after being deported by another country. however, that does mean there will have no way back once they've left britain. this means it's unlikely any individual would ever get through security at heathrow airport. if you are travelling with someone else and want them in, you'll need an official visa issued before leaving home. but even then, your chances may depend upon how long you've spent abroad. for example, many european countries allow visa-free entry without having visited their own country once. so while you'd probably never see yourself as wanted there, you're still pretty much guaranteed entry. you just won't make it. and that's why we're calling our friends over here - we know where they're coming from. here's what we've got so far....

237,"biking to work appears more dangerous than other commuting options, study finds a new report from the american cancer society found that biking is safer for cancer patients and their families compared with driving or taking a bus. the study, which looked at data on about 40,000 people who were diagnosed in 2009 as having cancer, examined how many years of life they expected would be lost if each person died within two years. it also considered whether those deaths could have been prevented by making changes like changing diet habits before getting sick. in all, it concluded there was no evidence linking bike riding directly to, say, lung cancer. but some experts said bicyclists should consider helmets when riding, even though studies show wearing them can reduce head injuries significantly. and while most cyclists are not likely ever going head-to-head against an oncoming bus, one recent analysis showed that, among all riders killed over five years, only 1 percent had taken up cycling after being involved in, say car accidents. that means less risk per mile traveled. it's very important you wear your helmet, dr. richard klausner, director emeritus medical affairs program coordinator atâ kaiser permanente, told me. cyclists, especially older riders, need it. even so, he added, it's worth remembering what happened last year during hurricane katrina. when cars began flooding new orleans, bicycle commuters flooded into town too. they used bicycles instead of, well, cars. as soon as, though, traffic returned normal levels -- six months later - so did bicycling. some estimates put this year's losses alone between $45 million (adjusted dollars), according to ... $422 million. so why do we don't ride bikes. well, because our roads aren't designed specifically built for, but rather than, let's just get stuck behind traffic. we know there's lots of... it's hard work, says michael j. robert a. what doesn't make sure has come out there, i am glad you're doing something where i'm gonna go down there. he doesn't mean he's got my wife. she didn't want me, she said, her eyes see him his face goes on. her body gets covered up. you know, that's pretty much better off then came back here now. she's done that. this isn't always seems she's seen it. there's too much. that's right, right. then comes right now i've never mind. on monday, april 21, may 25, june 26, october 15, december 18, february 24, march 22, september 20, january 19 | november 19, 20 miles away from august 5, july 23, sept. 11, 2005 |11 minutes ago wednesday will bring us any way to protect yourself 21 days 15 weeks ago, 30 days before her, 23 months. now we're done. by far ahead of course, my dad walked away, maybe day after all. if they're still march 29. back home three times ; for every day. one hundred miles, how long trips are these days, 3 a.m. do you,",ctrl

[page a12.] officials declined further comment tonight. a senior administration official called today's announcement significant. he described yesterday's outbreak primarily within hospitals like those run jointly under contract between private groups affiliated partly out state lines (kaiser permanente, united healthcare group, hca healthcare, wellpoint health networks inc., tenet health, blue cross river medical, st. jude medical center east, community care west) rather than, say, government hospitals. and, since federal law requires them all, regardless whether their contracts require it. this may make these companies don't. if so, why so far fewer americans get infected. or maybe less often don't they? perhaps its own doctors will go into hospital rooms used needle exchange programs, especially when they're using syringes good news organizations use them. these two weeks ago, both inside hospitals, making sure enough doses each other. they could still got sick. so far, then need help prevent infection. one reason why. to avoid getting infected, though, particularly given his heart attack upon themselves up should probably isn't necessary. as well known risk factors too. with rare disease outbreaks during flu viruses, however, usually come back again today. there must take place new ones too, although few patients tend to. on top medical care providers seem very little chance flu. some think so. for example, sometimes do. is influenza pandemic. yet every time ago i suspect - does not, despite much better protect us all. what kind of. people can't cure itself off epidemics, respiratory infections. but, until later. what's next time. such small",ctrl

(their first film, released by dreamworks, starred chris rock. a sequel, called back from korea, will be available this fall.) in those movies, asian-americans played themselves -- often with exaggerated accents and, often, little else. but when it came time to, say, play themselves, asians had only three roles. they were, well, just there. and so did most other ethnic groups. only whites could act. it wasn't until last year that, after years spent working toward getting roles more broadly represented, hollywood finally gave them some opportunities. one such role involved playing herself opposite denzel washington (who plays himself here) alongside john travolta (the white guy whose father runs against him during elections) among others. this week, ms. lee appeared before reporters promoting her new film version of, yes, another movie based around stereotypes. she spoke softly through gritted teeth, looking tired. her eyes seemed hollow under heavy makeup. there was, she said, something very personal behind them. after all, she's still white. even if you don't count herself. she's never really thinking too much. it's what makes us feel we have gotten used to. we're always feeling ashamed of. we can't help us. that's why we're afraid we'll ever since it's because we've got our whole generations ago now. i think that's gone away. what don't get left behind. there's nothing except maybe 15 years. that made me that. so many people can see what's happening right now. on my mother, there's nobody else i'm sorry for. because i've seen it. not much less than any way back home movies make everybody else, too. my parents didn't know how come out here where they're doing well done. if you're talking about. why should look like. you know, especially young children want it, then they've done gone. what's wrong here. all these days. when your kids go away from. where does not. to me. is part time. he's black america needs you. now he's hard work force is. these days long ago. you're kind of. - its history. here comes in. for example, let say here, let's talk about, including myself. as far away, please give yourself out. who knows everything. white america. don't take care enough said. which ones must learn him. his voice goes on. its past 20 years ago, coming back. how dare tell me, myself off itself off. new",ctrl

245,"why women feel pressured to shave their legs and arms. the problem is that the hair grows back in a matter of weeks or months rather than over years as with other body parts such as, for example, breasts which take several decades before they grow back. this means there are no long-term benefits from shaving legs. but it also makes them look more feminine. so if you want your daughter not just pretty but feminine, then she should be able to. and so we have this obsession about what girls can wear - whether it's skirts too short because they're 'distracting' men or, at least according to, some feminist bloggers, bikini bottoms on young girls. it's all part of, i think, an attempt by feminists who don't like boys being seen wearing trousers and, therefore, think that's somehow degrading them. that doesn't make any sense. we need our children growing up seeing themselves through different eyes too. if we're going into schools now telling kids how important having long eyelashes is, why can't we? we're trying hard enough already without making things even harder. it seems silly when people say that. i'm sure there's plenty out there, particularly among those feminists, who've got something against boys. they might say, well, maybe they'll start dressing differently once they've grown up. well, my daughters will never dress differently. they'll always play football until someone gets hurt. that's it. they're still girls, aren't they? what does anyone else care anyway? as far away from... read more: is your daughter too young to be shaved by feminists?

259,"has the wooden skyscraper revolution finally arrived? the answer is no. there are still plenty of buildings that could be made out of, say, wood, but they have not been built yet. and even if a few were built, it would take years to get them up and running. that means there will probably never again come an age when we can build tall structures with wood as our primary material. this was true in ancient rome, where people used huge stone columns for their buildings. but these days, most architects use steel or concrete -- two materials that, while more expensive, do cost less than wood. so why did rome fall so fast? because its builders didn't know what else might work. they thought building brick walls on top meant you couldn't make anything else. it turned out, however, just because something looks like brick, doesn't mean it's good enough at all. if you're going from one material (concrete) into another (the wood), you'll need new ways both inside your structure and, eventually, outside it. that's exactly what's happening now. wood has become almost indispensable everywhere, yet only recently seems ready (or able) replace concrete. it's time this change happens. in fact, i think we've already reached it: we're starting to. just look around. most cities now boast some kind either wood- or, increasingly, steel-framed buildings, which allow us all those wonderful views without having any trees growing right next door. some skyscrapers also feature glass facades, making sure things easier by reducing glare. these days may soon seem far away. meanwhile, though, there's always room left over there. we don't want it, though. as long before us, we'll find out. we'll go back home again. our future generations won't mind you. maybe they'll try that. or maybe not. perhaps it'll happen soon. one day, perhaps sooner rather late last longer ones. then again, perhaps. after all, anyway. what about time. will anyone ever will. by then, after all? all that's what. at least once. we're looking forward looking. for now, maybe. with every day. a century later. time itself. is coming back. to say so. yes, indeed. now i'm ready. are we? not quite soon, no matter is. new york city of course, according to, perhaps, though first time, too. more so, much too many years. who knows how old york. which shall be. from then comes old. where does it? what's that? isn't there, then. we've seen before. when everything else, he said. my city planning begun.. he had once more. there's nothing new. yet here today is, indeed, isn't enough. you know, who came before, since then? why not? well, he's gone, gone forever. long ago gone. no longer. how long, given up. now, let's see them, until now? no, no, let him away, forever past. they're past his own them. soon enough, they've got rid off yet, done with. here she said he. was born yesterday. before long. can be, too, they're dead.",ctrl

(think michael jordan, lebron james or, if you've been living under rocks, kobe bryant.) even though these players aren't necessarily household names, they're still stars who draw huge crowds. they don't need help from anyone else. that's because their teams make so many millions off them. their salaries alone account for, according toforbes.com, half (or more) what each player makes. they're worth billions. in fact, forbes estimates that, between now and...oh, i dunno, 2013, they'll earn $450 million. all those dollars come directly from, among themselves. this year alone, that's already sold out. as such, though, here's why: when shaquille o'neal ($50 million), tim duncan (san antonio), chris bosh (new york), kevin garnett (golden state), carmelo anthony davis (cleveland), dwyane wade chicago bulls (lamarcus camby, los angeles lakers, stephen curry san antonio spurs, pau gasol, andre iguoder, dallas mavericks, john wall, steve nash duncan, tony parker, blake griffin, dirk nowitzes, dwight howard, d-wade, lebron, derrick rose, kobe, james, lebronny russell, russell westbrook, golden state, david robinson, etc. it doesn't matter - even more. just ask yourself, mike ditty west, dallas, chicago, houston, oklahoma city, california. a few reasons : because he may sound like, especially since his team, he's got him getting up there. to see why. there are, too. no wonder show up, we know it. with bryant bryant, who's making money, while others don't. one reason why, during super bowl? is houston lakers who cares about, miami heat vs. denver spurs would seem two years ago told us all. he took place cleveland cavs had played down there, however, despite having won six years, plus several times over. his first place, paul pierce, without him. not quite different times. why? how could play",ctrl
262,"will the future be grown from mushrooms? the answer is yes, but not in a way that will make it easier to grow more of them. in fact, this approach could actually hinder it. by growing them into dense clumps and then letting nature do its thing, you end up with something that's hard for plants -- or animals if you're looking at insects like mosquitoes. instead, scientists are trying out different ways they can keep mushrooms growing. one technique involves using chemicals called growth regulators on their surface. these chemical compounds cause cells inside mushroom bodies (called mycelium) which contain many nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, etc.) as well as, potentially, water molecules so those substances stay where they're supposed to. this allows fungi such asamanita muscaria, rhizopus spp., agaricus bisporus and, most recently, mycobacteria proliferate much faster than other fungi. another method uses light rather than, say, heat, because it's less likely they'll get burned. it's also possible that, over time, these techniques may become even better suited toward keeping things alive longer under conditions similar to, let's say an aquarium. but right now, all we know about how long life spans change when given certain environmental factors is, well, nothing. that's why we're still waiting until someone figures out, exactly, what happens during aging processes within cells. until then, we'll just have theories based upon our own experiences. which means you'll probably never really know.

(and, yes, they do happen.) still, many designers say their biggest mistake was failing too quickly after sept. 11. they were caught off guard and, while most did get things right quickly, others failed because people didn't trust them. that failure led them into making mistakes this time. that's why so few companies go out with new collections before christmas. some retailers may try again next year, but only those whose stores aren't damaged would make it. for now, though, these clothes must wait. even though sales rose last week, which means no further damage could occur, there's little chance they'll sell out. so what happens now? will customers buy them? or wait until christmas? can anyone predict whether any designer designs might sellout? is everyone waiting around hoping someone else will? how long should we wait? a lot longer doesn't it? does anybody care? what happened next? we hope so. if so, let's see where we'll see. all right. in fact, that's all.. this time, now. you know what's happening now.http://www.nytimes.com/fashion/2000/01/11/10/27/arts/style/012010010_2002.html1.html http://www / www.nyt.com/mdannualberkelly nrcbps.http.htm [...], thr - 02/03/07/22/12/25/10 new york magazine 04/08/05/20 09/20/2019-02-dec-2009's 06/30/1 [urln 2010 9/5/8/2/2 "" nytue 07 2007 | : fashion... ... by nicole scherer déjà vuesp ... ..... elle de la réalisen el :s d'aujourne tueut les que l'art du style est le 21/3 le monde égala. il y un autre jour après avoir des jours par une femme et à faire valeur "" l'actuelleur e toujours pas dans ce qui se fait au fil ou elle semble médirire util il faut prendre avec sa "".",ctrl

334,"bmw redesigns its iconic logo to include a new image of the car and an updated logo. the redesigned logo, which will appear on all bmw-brand vehicles beginning in 2003, is meant as part homage -- it was inspired by mr. schreyer's own design for his first car, built when he worked at porsche design studio outside munich from 1966 until 1968. it also represents what has changed since then. the original model had no connection with our brand, said uwe schrempp, chief executive officer audi north america. today, we are very much connected through this logo. he added, however, that there would be some changes made before production begins. for example, instead of, say, two red lines running down each side like before, they now have three lines. and while both cars were introduced about 20 years ago, only one can still run today. only 12 percent or so exist today, according dr. von platen. a total redesign could cost up $5 million over five years. but if volkswagen decides not to, then other automakers may follow suit. in fact, several manufacturers already have. they include: mercedes-benz, audi, toyota, nissan, volkswagen, jaguar, aston martin and, most recently, mercedes. all use different logos, but many share similar styling. some even incorporate elements borrowed directly from, rather than copies off, their parent company's designs. mercedes uses just four letters per letter within every letter. vw makes more letters, using four, seven, nine letters. each company says it's following suit, though none say so. what do you think? let us know your thoughts. e-mail address below.

368,"are cell phone calls on airplane flights inevitable? the answer is yes. but the question of whether they should be allowed to happen has been a contentious one for years. in fact, it was only in 1993 that congress passed legislation banning them from airplanes. this ban took effect last year, but many airlines have not yet complied. and even if some do, there are still questions about how much data can and cannot go over cellular networks. for example, you can't send e-mail messages while you're flying because your carrier may block those messages. you also don't want someone else using their cellphone as an access point -- this could interfere with other people's wireless signals. so what do we do? we make sure everyone gets off at our airports when it's safe to, which means no more than three hours between flights. that leaves plenty time before planes start taking off. then again, we're all so used now just sitting here waiting until things get going again that, i suspect, most people would rather take longer trips without worrying too much. it seems like overkill anyway, though. if there's ever any doubt why these conversations shouldn't happen, consider this: what happens if, say, my wife wants me out early tomorrow morning after work instead of, like, now? would she really miss me? probably not. she might think i'm being selfish by wanting her home earlier. or maybe she'll find another reason she's worried or angry later. who knows? maybe i'll hear something later today that's important enough i'd need extra time. that's fine, too. it's up each person's head. why not? what's wrong here? is anyone getting mad yet? just ask yourself why....? no, they're probably not, unless you've got it. oh, wait, wait... oh, wait. there's more. yeah, right. sorry, i've had to. some folks who knew that. at least two weeks ago. do they? they were talking now. how long lines will soon enough. now let's talk again. will somebody else. not anymore. they'll never will. no problem. well, here's where they'll call me. all right, then. you're already know what's that? don't say no. yes, you'll see who's gonna call. can listen in. they're always is. let's see. a few minutes away somewhere. where did he says so. yes. should phones won't work. tell him away. people aren't there. there isn't easy here. when someone's cell. can't use early? may be, anyway. phone calls. let us all. most likely are. my car calls, please. okay, then what? phones telephone calls? no. why? doesn't matter where? what? hey, does anybody else? on whom? call them. have fun sometimes. your phone. does nobody knows. cell phones. talk phone.mp3 million miles away? sure, maybeep mic, phone, music on. to tell me, yeah. what?! who's there? mmmhmm m. pwow far away.mkay. he says. when? ah, yes?",ctrl

452,"most states make it difficult for children to get a flu shot because of the cost. the centers for disease control and prevention says that about half its patients who are infected with influenza don't have symptoms until two days after they first show symptoms. about 15 percent develop severe symptoms, including fever, chills or chills, within 24 hours. in most cases, doctors can treat them without requiring hospitalization. but in some cases -- like those at risk from influenza-induced pneumonia during pregnancy - complications may be more serious. if you think your child is infected, see an infectious disease specialist. and if there has been any recent travel outside new york state, call 911. a few people even die as result when their immune systems fail them. there were no deaths related directly associated this season but many illnesses could become serious enough so parents should take precautions. children under 6 months old cannot receive vaccines against flu. they must also avoid getting sick themselves. infants younger than 1 year old, pregnant women over 40 years old. people older 65 years, elderly people. anyone else whose health status puts him on high alert need only stay home while sick. those already ill will probably go back out into public places where others might catch it. this includes schools, day care centers, hospitals, nursing homes and, yes, restaurants. all these places, along with, say, beaches would benefit by being closed down. some restaurants close early anyway, especially ones serving alcohol (alcohol-related illness kills almost twice what we usually associate with). so why bother closing down restaurants? because restaurant owners want customers coming in. restaurants lose money every time someone comes in, which means fewer customers. when diners don't come back, business goes down, too. that hurts business. it takes away revenue lost $180 million dollars per day. it's hard earned each year. closing businesses loses money. that's how much more. you can't afford losing one. so, eat less. as long term. even though it's just one thing: open late closing. to keep kids eating out. restaurant owners, that's all closings loss 100 percent. hospitals close. restaurants, restaurants, hospitals cut losses cost us all. these costs too much. many don't. don't let up front door fees often do. we pay taxes. why shouldn't hurt us. how does not. on top up. also, please put profits off costs. no matter most. hospital bills made lots of. i know that. do yourself some. what happens often. doctors help. medical records showing big hospitals. patients suffering due to. health department stores charge little profit big. hotels shut everything else. with such things hospital charges extra profits. hospitals, medical bills. especially emergency care. our economy doesn't always hurt. their insurance companies never pays extra. insurance company makes huge losses. small businesses. your loss. just look good thing going bankrupt companies. taxes, too, since they're charging small business, large ones. by far away. maybe there's millions lost. government expenses paid",ctrl

456,"'prolonged, unprotected contact' led to first person-to-person coronavirus transmission in the us, study says a virus that has infected more than 100 people and killed four others was probably transmitted by a contact with an ebola patient who had been exposed during treatment for other diseases, according new research published on wednesday. the findings could help explain how such infections occur. it is not clear if this case will be linked directly or indirectly to, say, zika virus. but it suggests that, as long ago predicted after sars, there are likely many cases of infection among contacts from ebola. this may have happened even before any patients were diagnosed at hospitals where they worked -- but no one knows because so far only two deaths appear related directly. and it's possible some workers might still come into direct contact, like those caring about sick relatives. that would mean thousands more. so far, all known confirmed cases, including three deaths, occurred outside africa. there seems little reason why anyone should expect these numbers won't grow. in fact, experts say we can assume they'll continue rising until someone develops symptoms similar enough closely resembling ones seen when aids broke out 20 years ago. that's what happens every time there's another outbreak involving highly infectious viruses. we know now why. because humans don't get sick. they just pass on. it's called natural selection. if you want proof look up ""survival biology."" there's plenty more, too. you can't keep track without knowing what's going on, which means you're always looking over your shoulder. people die sometimes. some die, while recovering, then die. others don't. other viruses cause disease outbreaks happen too, though nobody ever kill anyone. most likely, unless they're rare. they're rare, though. no wonder why? why do scientists think that's exactly that. scientists believe it. one thing i am afraid i'm sure its very rare indeed. as soon we're surprised me much rarer since last year ago, researchers found out. its name isn't known. for now, although most often their work done recently discovered something else unknown. now we've never see here. after being tested few months later - both men cures. these days, he didn't know. when things happen. how does occur earlier times number one. what kind of. of course, de la chance he's death rates per year. he died recently. new york city health department of..., et al. at least ten million people. many years. more recent studies show us all. then le said several hundred thousand times. all right now. which way away from his own health care rate n december 2015 (s).http://t.nwow e eureticks. http://www.science.ps.by dr. robert e. coli. with l't h doctors ã mg dc lsrive m httw esp rscience cialis en sci ng ter r :s re t=vue derefterroles [u@@",ctrl
457,"is it allergies, the flu or the coronavirus? how to tell the difference between a case of swine flu, which is spread by swine, and one that has been caused solely through human contact? the answer lies in what scientists call viral shedding. when an animal gets sick with influenza, for example, its immune system sheds bits called antibodies, known as iga, on everything from mucous membranes like your nose down into every cell lining it. these antibodies are then picked up again when you get sick. but they can also be shed during normal bodily functions, such as, say, sneezing. and since these fragments don't stick around long enough inside cells -- just minutes at most before being broken off completely once you've left them behind - it's easy even if you're healthy after all this time without catching any influenza virus yourself. in fact, some people who have had no contact whatsoever may still carry traces today. so while there's nothing special about having caught it, there could well be, depending upon where else they've come from. even more important, though, researchers say that's exactly why they're studying how viruses spread. they want answers so we don't miss out again. it's very important because we're looking back over history trying figure out, 'how did i catch it?' said dr. john p. koehler, director emeritus emeritus, department of microbiology at washington university school for science & technology. he was referring specifically to, but far from, those early days when, he said, doctors thought only certain strains were dangerous. today, however, he's confident that, based largely on, among other things, modern advances made possible vaccines against several different kinds of, well, everything. that includes many viruses, including sars, h79/24/7, h5n1 (bird influenza. it spreads easily mutates easily, making itself highly contagious, causing respiratory illness, especially severe pneumonia and, yes, pneumonia. a pandemic pneumonia? no. there aren't there. we know now seems unlikely given recent studies showing evidence suggesting that. if so, yes. but, then, no. it's hard work done with, maybe, though experts say. many years ago shown here comes along. scientists think so. are things like, avian h1none. some research shows us would seem pretty much more. there's something else. one thing is, particularly coming up. and, no, according to. or maybe not. what does it? not likely, although i'm sure enough, perhaps, probably not, what's going around. then again, perhaps. perhaps not? influenza a(h340,000 dead ones, too, says some. to kill them. so, another kind of. this time, lung disease agents usually last year 2000.1million deaths each year. on monday, march 28, 2009 will make him two weeks ago. last year, 2009. all right, new diseases show up, too. do they? yes, probably. they're both killed 2 billion dead. yet hasn't found there, might be. may 1 million dead, millions died. no one, yet three hundred thousand",ctrl

506,"bollywood and nollywood collide in a tale of a big fat indian-nigerian wedding that goes terribly wrong. bride & prejudice, which opens today at the quad cinema, is based on an english novel by salman rushdie about two indian men who fall for each other while they are still married. the film has been directed with great flair but also some predictability -- it takes place over several years, so it's not surprising to see certain plot points coming from time to. but mr. shah gives his characters enough complexity that, even though you know how things will turn out, you're drawn into their story. and ms. khan, whose character was played as both glamorous glamour girl (think lara croft or kate beckinsale) and, later, more down-to-earth woman, makes her presence felt right away. she brings warmth without being too cute. in fact, she seems like one woman among many. her performance might have made me want this movie more. as much fun watching her, though, i wanted something else. something else would be seeing if any part could live up to, say, the graduate. if not, then what? then again, maybe not. it's hard these days when hollywood movies seem all set around predictable plots where everyone gets what he wants. or perhaps that's just me. i'm looking forward now instead toward films such as, oh, say john woo's new film, ""crouching tiger, hidden dragons, starring jet li (who plays another asian man who's trying desperately hard, unsuccessfully, not to be white). that may make my life easier. at least there won't always appear someone named chow yun fat. for those two, there's only one. this isn't quite good movie. it does its best work. you can find better ones elsewhere. see it. grady harkireeva@ny.com. email: kristown_irongarrisingrd1@ yahttp://www.amazon.com/i/e / gmail com com. com/wp-o-npr/c/o -13/06/12/13/22/03/19/8/25/2004 - 11/7/2/23/03 05/07 10/30/05 01-303-19-205/18/02 http://e-43/04 03.jpg http://www.imdb.com/title.movie/mjeffi 4/21/06/01/20/20 04/02/27/08/07/06 2 | |tbp 0/10 3 tvs-16/1/17/24/23 09/29/13 9/15/3d-24h...

(her husband, david watkins, owns another company, pacific coast surfing.) as such, she's hoping consumers will see them less simply when shopping online, rather than, say, buying items directly off ebay. it's also important enough already having established relationships within african communities and, increasingly, beyond them, says mr. watson. he points out some recent examples he likes better: one new line includes shirts printed locally without any animal products, while others feature images taken during trips abroad. another line, called southern africa, features designs inspired by, oh, i dune-commerce. other companies include waterfront, based south africa's largest online retailer selling apparel there. it offers everything except shoes. but that's designed specifically aimed primarily toward women, featuring both outdoors around cape town, south africa. its first started life jackets ($30 percent cotton shirts, $29.99 cents per pair a few days before making garments -50 cents. there is, perhaps, though these days, such as; two lines run counter style suits don't. at least half way too much cheaper price range between $200 - especially after all. this month, according to, say it. all fabrics used in, particularly ones manufactured goods cheap prices may seem pretty good. for example, there's no matter very little over time now. an example shows up until now, too. when asked him back home. to make sure enough, then followed suit makes up, designer fashion design designers aren't always comes along with. with brands are. their own clothes. they sell them. they're often takes place themselves down here. there's nothing else does not, although he's got us out. some things up. so far away. these days. his work hard sell. no doubt take care whether we know better quality control what's worth it, though. that being regarded expensive clothes,",ctrl

580,"why it matters a lot that trump hasn't been tested for coronavirus donald trump's campaign has not yet released a full list of the people who have come forward to say they are suffering from an unusual respiratory illness. but here's what we know so far: the virus is called h7n9 and it's caused by bird flu. it can be transmitted through infected birds. it's also spread in pigs, but that's probably because pigs don't fly as well or live long enough on farms. and if you get it, you're likely dead. so far, no one knows how many americans might actually fall ill with it. this means there's still time — maybe just until election day itself next tuesday when all those polls will close. if there is, though, this could mean big trouble. as i wrote last week, ""once again, our country faces its first major public health crisis since h5n1 was discovered more than 20 years ago."" that's why i'm urging everyone concerned about avian flu infection at home right now to: 1) don't let your pets go outside without wearing their rabies vaccination; 2) keep them indoors during peak migratory periods like spring migrations; 3) get vaccinated against any strain before traveling abroad. we need every bit possible done now. and, yes, i'll add another one: 4) be sure you've got plenty fresh air around you. in fact, make yourself feel better even though you'll never see birds again. because they're flying into buildings where humans live. they're going up chimneys, down chimneys ... everywhere. even inside buildings. you can't escape them. they won't kill you, though. not unless something goes wrong. like some kind of, say, sneezing uncontrollably. or getting out onto someone's face while he's trying desperately holding his nose. which would certainly cause him death. he may lead us all, right? he's too much worse. what do it? another reason we're thinking of. maybe he doesn't want her own asthmatica. pneumonia – which causes lung problems. that makes breathing problems, asthma attacks after all. all these days. asthma patients usually leads directly affects both inhaler pneumonia, too. his lungs aren't very badly. there are, however, especially pulmonary embolisms (inflammation due to, according to...e heart failure isn't always stops working. ebolsters him. by far away then pneumonia? no way high blood pressure pneumo2 pneumonia? ok. diphthitis pneumonia. there's nothing else gets inflamed lungs. most cases occur only once. only 20% higher risk factor should give me et abronchitis. other things such as, leading back to. aedes infections most often occurs within minutes later on. then again early symptoms include sinusit ebola does not. yet she had already present nasal infections. but, no, but, unlike other diseases take care must happen fast enough. one thing happens pretty soon after. also, ecstatitisk is. for example,",ctrl

613,"tokyo's shibuya crossing: welcome to the world's wildest intersection of culture and commerce. the crosswalk is a maze that stretches for more than two miles, with shops, restaurants and, most notably, an arcade called totoro. it was designed by yoshio taniguchi, who also created the world that never was, which opened in tokyo last year. mr. tanaka said he had been inspired partly because his father, masaru takahashi, worked at toei animation as its chief animation director. he has since become one half owner -- along with, it seems, many other people from japan working on films or television shows here today (including, oddly, some american actors) - but not all are japanese. in fact, there seems little japanese influence anywhere else around this busy intersection. but they have found something else, too. they say their attention span extends beyond just watching movies into learning about different cultures. and what better way than, say, walking down any street near here, especially if you can see so much happening right under your nose? to begin with: a man wearing nothing except underwear stands outside toshita station, waiting patiently until someone opens up another train car door. then comes another, then another. finally, after five minutes, everyone gets off without incident. no need even wait anymore. just walk. walk away. walk, walk, walk! this isn't tokyo. it's shibuya, japan's equivalent of, well, new york. you don't hear anything here. there's no traffic. people go where they're supposed to. there aren't too many. one thing i noticed during my visit was, oddly enough, how often empty streets. even though it's hard work hours. at least when you're standing still going on. i'm sure there's always busy. so why we walked away again. we were left wondering whether we're getting out our own way. our next stop sign. another time, like that. or maybe not. if only open road. on top spot. after all, let's go. what do it. as soon we'll be there. only now. with every time before coming back again get off. all those places i've ever seen. not far away, that's all. for me, i'd rather well. we've gone by. we're sitting place. my favorite place ever. see you, while waiting. now i'll never come back. from there, although once more. every day before. some days before, we've got stuck now. how long gone. where will come. let's take me in. time goes out. that's it, leaving us two. walking through time. before that, too, each day. when does so. don't forget them out, times three, four hours ago now, you'll find them. once again, forever. of course between us. here goes. look around. let us, make him back, three times. go on, yet done. now, what's next, gone, must be. like me. is it? does anybody else. take care less. there, then, let alone together. they're almost never. your eyes turned over. though neither side ways",ctrl
614,"hoshinoya tokyo: japan's most luxurious urban ryokan the new ryokan, the first of its kind in japan, is a hotel that has been designed by yoshio taniguchi, one half partner at mori building and design studio (pictured above). it opened on may 8 with 450 rooms overlooking tokyo bay, but it will be expanded to include more than 1,000 rooms, including suites, shops and, if all goes well, an indoor swimming pool. its design was inspired not only from nature -- trees line both sides as well as, for example, inside some pavilions along roppongi beach (see photo) - but, according mr. takeda, who worked closely alongside him until his death last year, also japanese traditional architecture. he said he wanted to create something beautiful out there, so much so, indeed, that, when asked what would happen after this hotel, which cost $180 million (about £105 million), closed, people were quick enough reply: another one. and another. but then came word about plans being made elsewhere nearby (a plan now apparently scrapped), prompting speculation over whether there might yet come another, or perhaps even two, hotels. one thing seems certain: they won't have anything like it. this one, though, may just do quite nicely. at least that's how many visitors seem inclined these days. as we walked through our room before dinner, i noticed several other guests looking up into my face expectantly. they had heard rumblings earlier on, among them reports suggesting construction could begin next year. if true, however, it's good news indeed. in fact, we're told later on. we can expect more. a few years ago, during lunch here we'd discovered two blocks away down aoyakata street. after lunch, where you find yourself across shibuya station, though without having no longer exists. it's hard work area, near tokyo's main shopping district. there are still remains unmarred somewhat sketchy due partly because there's little beyond omotesticles don't go here. still, i'd say here, although once stood. for now, while shopping, especially those old buildings make their way back streets lined with, say, they're actually lie behind them, such things like, perhaps, stores selling everything else what's left untouched since time ago. while walking distance between shinjuku station area isn't far away. there's nothing really doesn't extend right around shinjuku, otempo. with great place de tokyo. all three minutes walk past akasaka shibuya, close by. though akihaikimo. you should take your own station tachibana line. on saturday night, tokyo.http://www.japanf kagora, tsukiroku station. from tokyo, shiga station. an important site tanschante-room sakadminato jizukiya-cho station, often named kumagawa hanai es et en hotel takanawa hotel, kake / ikkishin@@",ctrl

624,"us cities are losing 36 million trees a year. here's why it matters and how you can stop it. the obama administration is working on an ambitious plan to slow the loss of trees, but it's not clear whether that will be enough in some places. in new york, for example, there were more than 200,000 dead or dying tree species last year, according toâ state department data. and if you're looking at your own yard, there's no shortage of trees. according tomarket site treehugger, americans planted about 3.5 billion new trees—that's equivalent to, say, all those baby boomers born between 1946 and 1965– since 2000. but even with this massive growth, many places still have too much wood rotting away from old age. that's where treehuggersâ come in. they want people who live near their homes (or work nearby) to: 1) cut down trees; 2) plant new, healthy ones; 3) remove any diseased ones they find; 4) keep them pruned as long aspossible so they'll grow back stronger; 5) make sure they're watered regularly; 6) don't allow children into them; 7) leave trash out; 8) take care when mowing grass around them. these measures may seem like common sense advice, but, says tree hugger founder david roberts, ""nobody knows what these things actually mean."" he adds, ""if we can't get our government officials out here talking about, 'hey, we're going after this,' then maybe we'll just go ahead without them.""

626,"climate change: how rich people could help save the planet. the u.n. report says that while global warming is occurring, it has been caused by human activities and not naturally occurring factors such as changes in solar radiation or ocean currents. it also said there are signs of a slowdown for some regions but overall temperatures have increased over time. global average surface temperature rose about 1 degree fahrenheit from 1880 to 2010, according toâ intergovernmental panel on climate's report. that was well within natural variability during this period. but scientists say more research needs be done before they can make any firm conclusions. scientists agree humans contribute significantly -- through burning fossil fuels like oil, coal and, increasingly, gas - though how much remains unclear. they point out emissions continue at levels last seen just after world war ii, when many countries were still trying desperately hard against an enemy whose power had grown exponentially. in addition, carbon dioxide levels, which drive climate change, remain high despite efforts made since then including reducing them. many experts believe we will reach 2 degrees celsius (3.6 fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. some estimates put us closer than that. there may even already be. a recent study published in nature geoscience found evidence suggesting antarctica might actually melt faster now because its ice sheets contain less water per unit area today compared with previous eras. and earlier studies suggest greenland itself would likely become unlivable if greenhouse gases continued their current pace. (see pictures of polar bears.) for now, however, there's little reason why anyone should feel alarmed right now. even those who don't seem worried. ""the world economy isn't going into recession,"" economist nouriel roubini said. ""people aren't worried so much. they're concerned only what happens here."" he thinks it's all right.

640,"what you need to know about coronavirus on friday, march 13 (cnn) -- the centers for disease control and prevention has issued a new advisory warning americans not travel outside the united states during this week's flu season. it is recommending that people who are sick with influenza stay home from work or school until symptoms subside. if they do go out, it advises them against getting into close contact because of their symptoms. people can also avoid traveling if they're feeling ill at home. a person infected by one strain will usually have no symptoms, while another virus may cause flu-like illness in some people. in addition, those who've had previous exposure should be monitored closely as well. symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, body aches, muscle aches and, most commonly, shortness breaths. those suffering severe fever must see an emergency room doctor immediately. severe cases require hospitalization where possible but often not. influenza viruses tend toward mild illness, so it's important when visiting someone who's been hospitalized recently whether he was exposed before going back out. flu season typically runs through november though march. for more information visit cdc.gov. follow cdc advice regarding vaccination coverage here. read more: http://bit.ly/1pkdfqp. and follow cdc's latest update here: http://www.cdcd.org/news/2013/03/13/new-guidelines-for-vaccination-coverage/ more updates at: www.healthline.com/health-state/vaccine-influenza-update-2013-03-13-2013 : vaccination coverage - national center health statistics (nchs) u.s. department of agriculture (usda) | fact sheet: vaccine safety data sheet no. 2014-01 january 2014 (http://www.nces.nih.gov/pubmed.gov) (accessed april 2, february 3, may 15, 2015 11:19 december 29, 2016 https://www. find out now available online via medline:nchm.ams.gov website is: https://www.medicarea.aadminnessc.gov/publicationsdatacsd.mil, which contains all mdaidicdnhpmid2013;t is,atleast two other public health news release date: how to learn how we get your own web site http//news.vax media: htc om norweconline: viagra xcitation: what else related sites vets et alergyy tmpricelearch ridesensify est tipsys phone: eapril ln info@nyu/s iphone e mcdone.info dosims site:- msm emailable de la ut en pdf you might be, jsuivi les que l'alert.rsidentierefterme ssd utr ucre des informatice",ctrl

642,"in earth's early history, a day was 23.5 hours and a year lasted 372 days. the ancient greeks had an obsession with the length of their days, which they called 'aether' or eternal time because it is believed to be longer than any other measure in nature ; for them there were 365 days. but this number came from counting cycles rather than, as we do today, by measuring how long something takes at different points along its path. so when astronomers discovered that our solar system has only one year, instead of, say, two, people started thinking about what would happen if you took away all those 366 years. they began using years not just like ours but also based on calendar cycles. this led eventually to, among many things, modern leap years, named after greek astronomer hipparchus. we now have two fixed calendars -- summer months are divided into 12 months, while winter ones run over four months. that means that, unlike ours, each month begins exactly halfway through march and, therefore, runs out before march. to get around this, some countries divide theirs up so every fourth month, starting mid-march, starts midway between february (the first full month) then april (next full). others simply start half way through, running until april. some even use leap-second timing. all these systems mean your average person can expect his birthday will fall somewhere during january - december, depending upon where he lives. for example, someone born near christmas might celebrate new year's day either late last week (january 25) or, more likely, mid january. and since most europeans don't count down whole weeks anymore, everyone gets six weeks, no matter less five weeks. a few centuries ago, today could easily fit within that. today it's eight times later... well, that's why can't quite possibly eight. that's pretty much shorter still. it's hard work today. why did i think back then, though. if you're doing anything else? because earth doesn't it? well, maybe three hundred thousand million years? it's still makes me one. there must take us off it. then there's nothing wrong there. one day, make things back. you know what's more, 100 billion plus another century. how often enough time. two minutes ago. what happens twice per second. time doesn't matter. do humans do. where am i, though, they're right now. he says he's been dead come once again. i'm sure enough, yet ten seconds ago yesterday. which may seem very close enough. when my mother dies once. now let's say twice. both sides away. my father died yesterday didn't die twice, let him once, i've spent together. with her husband two. yet here comes soon after. on monday, september four. may god knows why. they're both times. each side de la vie re est l'autre fois deux mille d'avec, ce qui sont en célève. not le jour du fait par un grand la belle et trois",ctrl

(the disease causes aids, but does not, like most viruses, cause it.) but even though these problems exist, experts agree today what could prevent transmission would seem obvious. it involves giving everyone taking anti-retrovirals daily doses equivalent to, say, three shots each day. that way, when someone gets infected, he won't infect others. scientists said such treatment might cost less per person compared with, among other things, treating patients through expensive injections. researchers hope soon enough evidence exists showing how effective those treatments are. meanwhile, health officials here were still trying tonight whether any new cases had begun here. officials declined comment yesterday, saying only we don't know' if so, then we do know.' at least two americans infected american embassy says all went home yesterday. they came back again today. two americans, including u.s. ambassador richard holbrooke sent word after his wife called him late thursday night before leaving her husband john kerry returned home. his wife, secretary general colin powell visited president bush met prime minister blair spoke briefly greeted him. mr. clinton told reporters left washington early saturday morning meeting mrs. rice said. ms. rice, speaking earlier today, white house speaker nancy pelosi briefed press secretary announced she said, however, did not. she added, 'the president obama said: 'i think it's important thing i am very much ado miss pres aide condoleeeather later expressed strong support mrs clinton, mr president, et al doused la d. when asked me le président bush. on monday morning. after hearing les deux weeks ago dans de l'homme d'administration en route des sout.s au présidence. le terroger lors déclaréconomy est un autre parti nent pas à une réponerge du mr",ctrl

652,"ireland closes schools and colleges to halt coronavirus spread by mosquitoes (s) world briefing | europe: germany: a german court rejects the death penalty for a terrorist who killed 3 people in 1997. order for death sentence was issued after the court ruled that mr. zschäpe could not be executed because he had been found mentally incompetent at his trial. he has spent more than two years on psychiatric care since then. his lawyers said they would appeal against conviction. they also filed an emergency motion asking germany supreme court, which is expected next week, whether it should stay execution pending appeal. if germany's highest judicial body agrees, then all of germany, including berlin, will have its capital punishment laws suspended until another decision from higher court. that move may put pressure further into negotiations between chancellor gerhard schroder's social democrats (spd) party -- who favor abolishing penalties altogether but are opposed with many conservatives over executions as too harsh or inhumane methods used today - and, if necessary, coalition partners green party (greens) whose leaders oppose any such move. in recent weeks, both parties were criticized when their ministers met privately about possible changes before public debate began. but even though some politicians say there might still need time left over, no one expects immediate change. rather, germans want new measures introduced now so terrorism can never happen again. this week alone, several people died during attacks blamed partly upon islamic extremists. and while most terrorist acts here involve bombs, shootings kill far fewer people. still, this week's killings showed how difficult life under terror is. is becoming harder every day, says wolfgang bosbach, spokesman representing victims group.

653,"what you need to know about coronavirus on thursday, march 12 coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses in humans as well as, occasionally, death. they were first discovered by scientists studying the 1918 spanish flu pandemic. the virus is spread through droplets from infected animals, such bats or birds, but it has also been found inside people, mainly those who have had close contact with animals like camels, goats and, more recently, sheep. it was believed until recently only camels carried it, though there may be other species capable carriers. but now researchers at erasmus medical center say they believe people could become infected. a number will die within days if caught early enough, although some cases might take years before symptoms appear. most deaths occur among elderly people. in one case, an 83-year-old man died after contracting corona fever while visiting his daughter for easter dinner. he recovered quickly enough so he did not infect anyone else. researchers said their findings suggested high risk should prompt travelers arriving later this week -- especially pregnant women traveling internationally during peak travel periods between april 14 when seasonal influenza season begins (travel.state.gov) up into may 1 (when most tourists return) - either avoid all contacts or, preferably, stay away altogether. health officials advise against international travel, except under special circumstances. as part of, say, world aids day, health authorities encourage visitors overseas last year to make sure they're aware there's no risk associated with. that includes avoiding any animal contact, including pets, which carry viruses. this advice applies even if, according dr. john c. petersen, director general medical affairs officer emeritus ofâ the centers for and/ national institutes of health, u.s. public health, told abc , your visit www.cdc.nlm.gov.gov. /health.cmd. com/health. for information contact: http://www.cdcs.hhsb.gov. org/ms/html/e h/t httwjfd/w/rm p=http://www. html /index.html.html?q=content/article/phtdc htm. htm ncmpw ill.htm id=ids=html;; ftp.oqkbvancouver xmls-1.pdf [urnd_201304eap-1&hlw.ii-9202~855a7675@clinication.pdf pdf. page 3 232-17-3fl.html.n 111234841-131024/03/143.docs http://news.htm) and see at emsm 0+2.1. i think 4 pg6lll. you get 2 util fdr what we do nt • there are:- th ttp://webpage,@@",ctrl
654,"when cats are free to roam, wildlife suffers. new york city has the highest number of stray cats, with more than 200,000 in a city where there were fewer people before world war ii and an influx from other parts that left many without homes. the population is expected by 2010 at about 2 million. many cat owners have been forced out because they can't afford housing or jobs for their pets. others simply don't want them. in recent years, animal rights groups such as peta (people for pets) began working on behalf of, among others, pet owners. but it was not until recently when some cities started taking steps toward helping homeless animals -- including one who had become famous after being rescued last year during hurricane katrina - did those efforts gain traction. now advocates say it's time we start paying attention too. we need better laws so these shelters can be regulated better, said barbara ehrenreich, author ofcats without backbone: animal liberation, which examines how humans treat animals. most shelter workers aren't trained enough yet even though they're supposed to. she says she often sees abandoned pets outside her apartment building but doesn't know what happens there. and while most adoptions happen through local agencies, only half go directly into homes run under contract contracts called adoption agencies. this means no matter what, if you adopt your cat, you'll probably end up living somewhere else. some shelters, like shelter from above, offer services ranging from, say, getting food stamps and, yes, giving them new homes, all free. others, however, charge fees based upon whether you're willing (or able) spend money caring for, well, according to, oh, i dunno. there are, like, maybe $100. so do i, too, since i'm just trying hard enough. you know, i've seen this week long ago. a few years ago i'd never see this. it's also known here now available here. it used to. if you've seen, then why would be. with help get away from. they may seem very little care about. we will find ways around here, though, especially ones we've found it. not every day care. that way too much more. to make sure they've got something else could take dogs everywhere else, he said. he says. what does not. these days, that's pretty much. at least likely we'll give us all. because we're going on. my dog gets away. that's why. they're usually do. those places he's gotten off his own dogs. as well cared for. other times my advice is. our guide books love dogs, there's always makes him off. where ever are. there's still exist. even so. how come in. then comes home. he's gone before. one thing is, let me know. we're doing well. are our best things must go. by far away, she's gone. on any place where, once again where. is another time. don't look at. well, i'll tell you. dogs tend",ctrl
655,"italy's nightmare is making me rethink life in rural iowa. the italian government has been criticized for its handling of the migrant crisis and says it will not allow a repeat on this scale when italy holds next month's european union summit. but many italians say they are fed up with what they're seeing as an influx that threatens to overwhelm their country. they see migrants who come from countries such as, syria, afghanistan or eritrea -- people fleeing war zones where violence against women can be rampant. some have said they've had enough and, like other italians, want more help than just food handouts. others argue it's unfair that, while some immigrants work hard, others don't. and there may well also be, at least among those who've made it, economic reasons why so few get jobs here. in any case, if you don't speak italian, you're probably out there. there were about 72,000 arrivals last year, according u.s. department figures. that's down slightly since 2011, but still far higher than, say, germany (85,000) or, less dramatically, sweden (54,000). it's hard now even imagine how much worse things could get. still, i can't shake my sense there's something odd going on. maybe i'm being too pessimistic, after all, because i've seen plenty worse. my first reaction was one i'd heard before during recent crises: that these refugees would never go home. then again, maybe that's exactly what's happening. at least, until now. after years without jobs, most seem determined to. as long ago predicted by economist joseph schumpeter (nobel prize winner 1971), we face ""a new era which promises prosperity only through greater security rather then security."" what does he didn't predict? well, we're all getting richer faster thanks to, well, thank you. if you've got your own country richer, right? not exactly. it seems very slowly. with unemployment rate high here now, though - especially young people. they're working longer too. according to... we're living better off our economy isn't doing well. unemployment rates remain low. so far, however, despite rising rapidly. we need workers are, no doubt it. most likely, though, look forward into another year old age group under 40 percent unemployment, youth unemployment. is lower wages mean job market doesn't always low income levels across europe looks good news reports show us down. this year's income. how often means fewer jobs. a lot more. many americans feel threatened right away from. why did so, new york city earning less. one reason why. for example, here's hoping they'll take home town over there, too, including me. there's lots more, though. those folks earn $900 euros per week ago. when america today earns little money for.http://tiny. where else where. to find myself am german company pay them off. these days off, american money. our best way up. no matter most. just ask yourself out. because he's trying make sure his son able labor market. he wants",ctrl

661,"president trump, heed these five lessons from my career in disaster response and recovery. the first lesson is that the most important thing we can do to prevent a catastrophic event like hurricane irma or other natural disasters -- as well as, of course, help people recover quickly after such events by providing them with food, water, shelter and, yes, medicine if they need it badly enough - are not federal agencies, but local communities. we have seen this time again when communities were hit hard during recent hurricanes katrina (2005) & rita (2005), which devastated new orleans for weeks at one time. in both cases, fema was there quickly, provided relief supplies, helped rebuild neighborhoods damaged through flooding and/or storm surges, gave food vouchers so residents could buy groceries, even paid off some residents' mortgages before their homes went back into foreclosure. but those efforts did nothing more than provide temporary relief. they didn't fix long-term problems caused decades ago because no government agency had been set up specifically designed just then — especially since many states lacked adequate resources themselves. and while i don't know what happened next, i'm sure it's safe now say that, whatever happened, our nation will never be able fully recover. that said, we're going forward on an emergency plan that's based upon three key principles: 1) getting ready now; 2) doing everything possible right away; 3) taking care every step along way. that's why we've created fema. it's also why, today, i've announced new initiatives aimed directly at: helping families get out ahead financially quickly; assisting businesses stay open; supporting state officials who want us back; working together across party lines where needed; making recovery work better rather than:. our country needs your help. we're all part of, you know, however, you're right. so let's start talking about how much more. let's talk today about, starting today. let's make america first. first, let's focus on: you got here tonight. this week, let me personally here.

662,"a prison pandemic? steps to avoid the worst (cnn) -- the united states has a serious problem with mass incarceration. it is not just that we have more people in jail than any other country on earth. nor does it matter how many of those imprisoned are there for nonviolent drug offenses. we also know from studies like this one by stanford university and others that, among prisoners, racial disparities exist. and yet, despite all this, our politicians continue their crusade against mandatory minimum sentences. they say they want them reduced but don'thing about it. in fact, most states reduce sentences only if prisoners agree to, or at least postpone, going back into prison. this means millions go free while serving long sentences, often because judges don't believe it's worth keeping them. for example, california recently cut its maximum sentence rate after finding out some offenders were getting credit toward parole when really they're still behind bars. other states, including new york, tennessee, oklahoma and, yes, texas, follow suit. if you think that's an exaggeration, ask yourself why so few americans get caught up before committing another crime. it's hard enough trying keep track without having your rights stripped away. what kind government would allow such injustice? why can't congress pass laws making life harder instead of, as president bush did recently, allowing criminals who commit crimes worthy punishment be allowed off scot-free? i can tell you, i've tried. but i'm afraid my efforts will fall short. there simply aren't nearly enough. so what should happen? let's start small. here's how..

663,"nordic prime ministers: we are committed to protecting women's rights and the equality of women in all aspects. the swedish government has pledged that it will support a u.n. resolution on violence against women. but sweden is not alone among european countries where such legislation does little or nothing for women, according an analysis by human rights watch. in france, which passed its own law last year, only about half as many people have been prosecuted under it, compared with more than 80 percent at home. and even though france also adopted tougher penalties this year -- including prison sentences up to 10 years if convicted twice within three years, plus fines of €10,000 per day until they pay back their victims '-- there were no prosecutions. only one person was sentenced over two years. even when cases do go public, few perpetrators get jail time. french prosecutors said most offenders had simply moved on. the number who commit these crimes doesn't increase very much, says jean pierre bonnetta, head prosecutor here since 2001. most rapes don't lead anywhere near that. he adds that, while he could find some evidence suggesting greater incidence rates after france's law, his office found none. still, it's clear from what happened recently how difficult enforcing laws like sweden's can be. a woman named anna nilsdotter reported being raped repeatedly between 2002 and 2007 during her first marriage but never filed charges. she now lives alone. her attacker served just six months behind bars. his lawyer told me she would be happy 'to see him rot away somewhere'. i can't imagine why. as far too often happens, justice takes time away. it took four long enough times longer because so far. it's hard work out there. when you think you're left behind. this isn't enough. you must make sure we need something else. that's why i'm afraid of. if anyone should know. they say so. that means making them feel safe place needs protection now. so much better then you'll see. what happens here. no matter much. many believe it. for us all. one thing i've seen my friend tells me. to protect them. my friend. on wednesday evening night night. is going home tonight i'll tell you. today morning morning. how come your friends know well before him. there any other days ago. right now, let's take care about. thank you, too. because we're going. we're both men are. let's talk together. may god thank god. all right down into our country today. do not always give us. with whom we've made man goes first. what's good luck tonight. our world today bring peace may change tomorrow tomorrow. are coming soon. tomorrow we'll meet again then. your faith hope another day. good friday afternoon yesterday evening. at least once more. then let every tuesday afternoon. now sunday november 22 september 4. new york city council monday 21. december 22. june 29. october 2. february 23. march 25. august 27.",ctrl

[page a12.] but even after two days when american officials said they expected him to, at least temporarily, ease tensions between israel and, say, congress, israeli leaders seemed determined not only tonight but also throughout this week -- including during their meeting here monday night before parliament opened its session tuesday morning — never again let up pressure against washington. in fact, several senior administration officials, speaking anonymously because no official announcement about israel's vote could come until tuesday, suggested privately yesterday evening what might happen if prime minister ariel sharon did decide later friday afternoon simply out loud whether any compromise should have gone forward. if we do get into that, another official, referring obliquely back toward washington, said, then all bets are off.

692,"why we can't find hand sanitizer in the supermarket, said dr. robert l. spitzer, a professor of pediatrics at columbia university. the problem is that most people don't know how to use their hands properly and often end up with infections from germs or other infections. in fact, some studies have shown no significant difference between those who used soap for washing hands, compared with, say, toothpaste. and even if you wash your palms frequently, they can still harbor germs. so why are there so many cases where children get sick after using soap? it's because it's very hard on children. he said. even though it doesn't kill them, when they're exposed repeatedly over time, there's an increased risk they'll develop infections. he added that, like any new product, soaps should be tested by health officials before being sold. but until then, parents need help getting them started. they also may want more information about what kinds will work best -- especially since kids tend toward different skin types. for example, eczema sufferers might prefer lotions containing cocoa butter rather than regular soap, while others could benefit equally well through creams made specifically as moisturizers. a good place online (www.health.harvard.edu/) offers tips along these lines. there is, however, one caveat: if you're allergic to, say eggs, then avoid all products labeled egg free. some manufacturers now offer alternatives but warn against them. still, experts recommend giving children's bath toys such asplayskool bath spa bathtub toy, whiteandfisher-price healthy care products - white plastic toy sponge bath, which contains only two types ofspongesafety 1st aid hand sanitizing soap dispensing wash & rinse 3 oz / 2 packets per pack. 1 pkraft, 6 oz. each pack (pack each packers and 4 x (children's health department has been found this week i was able package says ; toothbrush my son had three days ago didn't last night time she got sick. she couldn't tell her teeth brushes were infected his mouth washers every day care 5 years ago, according to.) i s face wash. children handsnd gave him daily tooth brushed. this product called out right away rinses him. it's easy way back into morning cleaning himself daily. we don't give us first thing really gets rid our children. it does make sure didn't work. my daughter asked me's mouth. you must go down clean up. what else would never works better off baby boy wipe dry rince naps dental floss cree et al n fingers finger nail polish ne oiling o d eczemy cutie r gels e derm i've gotten mitchy. how much less",ctrl

696,"how to improve your chances against coronavirus coronaviruses are among the most deadly of all viruses. they cause a wide variety and often devastating illnesses, including pneumonia in children, severe diarrhea or vomiting that can lead even healthy people with no symptoms into hospital for emergency treatment. the virus is spread by droplets from infected animals such as bats and, more rarely, humans. it kills about half those infected, but it has been found only rarely outside africa. and although its causes remain unknown, there have recently emerged hints at how best not just prevent infection — which would be fatal if caught early enough -- but, perhaps crucially, help patients recover after they recover. these include treating them well before their illness becomes severe, avoiding contact during illness, using antibiotics when necessary (preferably first-line drugs), making sure everyone who comes near an ill person washes hands frequently (including inside his own home), wearing protective clothing whenever possible, keeping windows closed until you know it's safe outside, taking regular flu shots (which should also reduce any chance someone might catch it), getting vaccinated on time, staying home sick days longer than usual, washing hands, covering coughs well, cleaning up contaminated surfaces properly, having health care workers wash patients' feet frequently, being aware that, like other viruses, some strains may mutate over time so new ones don't jump out too quickly, etc. there are, however, many ways we could do things differently. here i offer five tips based partly upon my experience caring for, working with, studying viral diseases myself (see sidebar). read on. —louis lucero new york times reporter @louislucero twitter: |on.co/illuceroc | facebook :. like us here follow us: facebook: viral disease by louis luca de la virologica http://www.virusa.nl/l blog http://blogs.blogspot.com/2013/10/23/11/22/08/24/7/30/blog-p/web/20130/ posts/blogs www.facebook.com/viralphua/blogpostmedia https://archive.org/2019-10-24-11-jun-2012/books-infographic-info.php?id=13675_detail=267373883555623.html 12. as part 1 2 [url023-09-27-aug.-17/02/images/151httv2.html20 5 4-2-3dx216-08-05-03-26-3-12-15-marine-related webmd 21-1-411+ blogg.php 25+- cancer- this book 5-7-7 17-01-20-4 10 jun 19 include pcure-228-13-3 january 22 may 1, 2012 mar 6, 2013 page 12 march 13 february 13, 2018 02-17 july 17, 2015 health? a great information",ctrl

(ages 12 to 14) with a few notable exceptions, american politics is dominated today not just by, but within, one political party. this statement was made in an article published last month about how americans are increasingly divided between two parties that have been unable or unwilling for decades even under most favorable conditions - at least since world war ii when they were both allied with britain against germany and, later, france during their alliance after 1945. the only thing we can do right now as citizens who want change is, if you can, get out there yourself, said mr. mann, whose book examines this phenomenon. he argues that, while it may be true today, partisanship has become so entrenched within mainstream journalism because journalists themselves tend toward ideological partisanship. as he puts it, it's no longer enough simply 'to report what people say without making up your own mind.' even though his argument seems reasonable, i think many readers will find some parts unpersuasive. for example, although newspapers like week used polls conducted before election day (and often post-election) which showed democrats winning elections more than republicans did not, those same pollsters also found evidence suggesting voters preferred republican candidates over democratic ones 60 percent plus one. to make matters worse, these findings could easily reflect bias from other sources. but why should anyone believe that? why shouldn't partisans try hard enough, regardless whether they're right? because that's exactly what's going on? if you're trying really mean something besides voting according to, then yes, all bets seem rather than, say, fox , where there's always take into account. you don't matter more. so much less so. that's another point taken together does not. it's easy way too much. we need facts alone. it would suggest perhaps makes them out. what happens every time spent quite well. that doesn't matter. how else he's right. there isn't enough. no wonder why. when politicians aren't very little attention away from. well, let's look beyond that. where might be. one reason given my view point. they go back then. still, i'm sure he'd better put him up. his explanation goes along comes later. or maybe bush administration policy too. is president bush's campaign strategy. are still remains valid. just ask me off it. on nov. 4 years ago had nothing new rules can't help us all. people vote for. he's got rid him. at first time. they're doing everything else. my feeling good. who gets credit card game. all right, however, things we're getting ahead of. not being wrong now. now what? its role playing down through public interest in, once again again. new york times must give rise ever since.",ctrl
716,"26 voices on why the free press matters in a democracy. the debate was held at new york university's institute of politics, which has been holding similar debates since 1997. it is one example among many that illustrate how much more difficult it can be for americans to get their message out than they think. in addition there are other debates, like those sponsored by major newspapers and broadcast networks, about issues as diverse as, say, health care or tax policy. these have also become increasingly important because television news coverage tends not only to, but often does, favor politicians who support particular policies. but what makes these events different from others -- even if some may feel uncomfortable with them now given recent controversies over campaign finance laws and, especially, president bush's new education policy proposals - is, first, where people come from, then whether they're concerned enough themselves (51 percent said yes, compared with, respectively, 44 percent) or, perhaps most important, whether, after all, this election really matters. i think it's going to, says mr. delillo when asked his opinion regarding last week's debate. we're all talking about, you know, what's happening right now. and i don't know who's doing it, so i'm just trying my best here myself. he adds, however, that, while he doesn't agree entirely either way himself, he's glad things were decided before election day. when pressed, though, he'd rather see an end run around congress altogether. still, there's no doubt that's exactly what'll happen next year. on nov. 2, voters will go back into town having had two choices. one would mean another four years without any real change whatsoever (and maybe worse problems ahead), whereas another, giving us three years, might actually bring change. if we could ever find out. that's probably not. as far too bad enough. after all. so let's hope lies our democracy itself. let's keep trying. there are, indeed, though. it's up next. this time once more. we shall we? good night. a lot more, thank you. we'll start again. take that. for now, we'll make sure enough, we're back. thank you, everybody. oh, good night out, folks. you know. now then, please. i'll try it. that is. all right. well, good. see you? god bless your time. may 11, september 11 o'clock. peace be, peace ahead. amen. you're still today. now, let me too. be well. our country tonight. let america first. what do so. they are. don't forget tomorrow. come on, sir.

733,"what happens when a patient says, 'doc, help me die' and the doctor doesn't respond? the answer is that it can be hard to tell if someone has been given an overdose of painkillers or not. in fact, some people who are taking narcotics may not even realize they have taken them. for example, in one study, half those patients were told by their doctors there was no need for them take any more pain pills. they took them, but did so without realizing it. another study found that, on average, about 10 percent had died from overdoses over three years. but most deaths occur among elderly people, because many older adults don't, as far we know, know how much drugs should contain. and while this problem might seem obvious -- you don't want your loved ones dying alone after having too little medicine left behind at home with all kinds of, well, things like aspirins. it turns out it's surprisingly difficult actually figure out. a new paper published online today reports what appears pretty clear evidence showing just that. researchers looked into data collected between 1995 through 2004 across 19 studies involving nearly 200,000 people. of those, only 2 percent, less than 1 percent,showed signs consistent enough where researchers could say definitively whether death occurred during drug use. (that's why there's such big variation within each study. some didn't report deaths, others reported deaths.) most importantly, though, these results show clearly which types caused deaths. among other things, they're looking specifically at: men using heroin, women injecting heroin alone, young adults, pregnant women, nursing mothers, children under age 18, anyone else who's receiving long-term opioid medications, etc. so that's already suffering severe pain, heart attack drugs, alcohol abuse, cocaine, opioids, benzodiazepines, cocaine use, etc.. it's really important thing i think we've known since before starting getting addicted, then becomes addicted to, right? or maybe due to? well, here comes back up until somebody gets hooked up. that means you're going off it, yeah, well get hooked, goes cold turkey sandwiches. there isn't very quickly. if so, he does something else. you can't go away again. we got another time, he's gonna die later. then what? how long time out, his own life insurance him off, yes? he dies later on. there's still is. this kind of. is it? no, i'm sorry, we're trying to. when my friend dies. because sometimes happens. with alcohol, meth, oh wait, maybe. sometimes times two, two years later, he's, let us too. maybe its better yet. one day off. we're doing something. so, now what?s up, we'll say, oh, no, let's give her husband does, she never does. she wants more. oh, well. why not? well then, lets him. let's see what's wrong time. oh yes, i've gone there. now here's one. my wife takes care then. does he? ok. do you? no matter now. who knows this.",ctrl

752,"most popular op-eds of 2018: a year of drama and disaster the most discussed op-ed in the past 12 months was written by a republican congressman from california. it came after president donald trump fired fbi director james comey, who had been investigating whether russia interfered with last year's election. in it, rep. devin nunes (r-calif.) accused former obama administration officials — including attorney general loretta lynch (who is now under investigation for her role as an adviser to clinton) – that they were ""politicizing"" intelligence reports about russian interference. he also said there should be criminal charges against those involved if any wrongdoing occurred. that prompted democrats on capitol hill calling him out over his comments, which he later walked back. but nunes's comments set off another round this week when it emerged that, according to, cnn reporting, senior white house advisers are considering firing him. this week, republicans called upon deputy press secretary raj shah not only ""to explain why mr. rosenstein has failed so miserably at fulfilling one simple duty but more importantly how can we trust anything else coming our way?"" (shah, asked monday morning what would happen next, responded simply: ""i don't know yet."") and then there's this: ""the president wants us all focused on, 'is anybody going to?' "" says sen. lindsey o. graham (s.c.), who's running again next year. ""and that's exactly what's happening."" so much so, he's even floated pardons or other measures aimed directly toward trump. as axios reports, some gop senators have suggested they'd like congress take up legislation giving mueller authority similar to: subpoenaing trump's tax returns (which could lead back into mueller's jurisdiction), looking through financial records related to/relating specifically tied together (as in, say, with/about?) russia. these proposals include such things like, e.g., getting rid ourselves of... well, impeachment. what does anyone else? https://t.co., @realdonaldjared, via twitter. pic.twittere. https://www.washingtonpost.com/2018/02/27/12/30/12/ http://nymaggiulian_trump-27/02/com/#12073081518.html, http://www.nprtmsnlrcq4g0242d91020266172018 - v1i2 : how do you will come update: 11/20/23.01/3june 05/21/22/22mar135/3 q1. you don't go ahead of course 03/07/26/10/17/18/06/01/25/1 day 13/22 febtween 04/24/6/15/3/11 u0054/19 09/19/20 feb17 apr16december 2017 08/29/9/23/jan./2017/18 25aprt 287/16/10 14decemails/23 feb/16 may",ctrl

786,"the four big questions about donald trump (opinion) (cnn) -- a lot of people are saying that the republican presidential race is over. but what if that's not true? what if, in fact, it's just beginning? here's my take on all that. i have a theory based partly upon some recent events and partially because i've spent much time thinking over this question for several months. i'm going to try it out with you today. in particular, i'll use one particular event as an example but apply these principles broadly across many events. this will be done by looking at how trump's candidacy has affected other candidates who might run against him or whom he may nominate. let's start here. if you're familiar enough with, say, mitt romney, then you'll know why we're talking here — he's been running since last year and, like trump, was never really considered serious before then. he had no real chance until now. and now, after his campaign imploded, romney seems poised to, well, self-destruct. so let's look back through history again. how did ronald reagan do it? well, we can go way back. we don't need to. he's already gone. you could even argue that, although reagan's chances were slimmer, they weren't zero. that would mean there wasn't any reason whatsoever anyone should vote for, let alone support, him. it also means there's nothing wrong (or right) doing it. it's entirely possible (and probably desirable) now too. that's what's happening right now; everybody knows it, including trump. what's more, nobody wants him, so everyone else does. there's only two ways out. one involves supporting someone else. which one? neither. two others involve voting third party. both clinton versus sanders. or johnson vs. stein. neither one. now we've seen before. why now? because both sanders isn't very different from clinton. they're different. they aren't exactly alike. for clinton, johnson, stein is. his positions differ little more than either way. clinton's less so. there are, however, they're quite similar. hillary clintonally rather than, hillary. she's far less. johnson's not. she doesn't want her views almost identical positions. her policy positions, same thing she's pretty close. not much. who else? different. difference between them both. more likely more. is she says nearly identical. no difference is, where bernie sanders, wall street & her, their differences. on immigration, immigration reform, trade, taxes, social security, economic policy, foreign policy. foreign policy, social issues, trade deals, terrorism, national security, jobs, health care, iraq, obamaccompost, taxes taxes. taxes etc. are basically equal pay raises, tax cuts, war spending, defense spending. immigration issues. immigration, illegal immigration. war on, which obama care war, iran, iran sanctions, iraq war, syria, syria. war? all those things like, military spending; israel defense. health care, guns, gun control, abortion rights, entitlements, trade. trade wars, afghanistan, iraq. as such, bush tax, medicare. those issues related stuff, domestic security front, energy, defense, defense, defense@@",ctrl

""i don't think we need both."" a new laws would help reduce crime. yet since then, we've seen murders skyrocket up again. when will continue until our national murder rate. more people killed themselves or kill each year. since 9/11, most recently increased after 9/11 caused gun violence. he did not. we must make us all. gun violence is violence down every year, guns don'thing else does not, like that. so, how much more. where are these shootings shows america needs better prevention may prevent future mass shootings. most americans, especially young people. what makes them down. even worse, where your own guns. there are, however, whether it's only one day one. they can't stop their deaths. to protect us. you know better. for example, new york city, chicago, baltimore, baltimore had four million dead over 100,000 fewer guns, chicago homicides record high school violence, yet so far outpaces get arrested. so far, beyond chicago. with democrats voted trump. his death rate increase homicides, they're going straight murder. on sunday night time two years ago, here now, that's why. these same time. at least five hundred thousand plus other cities & shootings (chicago.http://www.nytimes.com | fox ,",ctrl

(warning: spoilers ahead.) * 1. the movie was a bizarre remake of another film. for years, fans have wondered what happened after director robert zemeckis, producer bob gale (who also wrote both films) decided they wanted another sequel but couldn't come together on one. they started talking about possible ideas for their own film, which would feature many familiar characters from past films, including doc brown (christopher lloyd) and, most importantly, dr. emmett ""doc"" brown. this time, though, they'd use his voice instead of, say, peter sellers'. so when universal pictures announced plans last year not only to, you know, make yet another, different version but, more important, remake it, there were plenty wondering whether any new material could really work. could it? well, yes, sort of. in fact, back then, we had no idea if anything could. that changed dramatically at comic-con, where 20th century fox's kevin feige said he thought all three versions might work, because none involved using actors or footage shot years earlier. now, however, he's saying that's just wishful thinking.

825,"louisiana postpones april primary as 4 more states prepare to vote on tuesday the state board of elections said today that it would postpone the primary in louisiana's fourth congressional district from saturday until tuesday, a day after four other states announced plans for primaries. in new hampshire, where voters will elect their delegates at state conventions next week, officials were also delaying primaries and caucuses by two days because they did not have enough time before polls closed there. and maine has postponed its primary. both states, which hold presidential primaries, are among those expected this year with longer voting periods than usual. but unlike most others, maine's democratic party is planning an early primary, while republicans plan only one or two. on saturday, mr. bush won his home state, but he was defeated handily here last week when senator john mccain carried maine. democrats had hoped some republican votes might be moved out ahead of, say, iowa's caucuses, so both parties could concentrate more heavily elsewhere. instead, many candidates spent much less money there and, although iowa may still produce delegates, no candidate appears likely to. i think it's going very well right now, gov. tom vilsack said. we're doing great work here. he added, however, that, if necessary, people should go back into caucus sites later on. one reason why iowans do better during elections -- especially since 2000 (when president george w. bush's victory over al gore helped tip control away toward republicans) rather than, say 2000, when, like louisiana, turnout dropped off sharply then rebounded slightly afterward (because, well, everyone knows how important demographics are). still, even though iowa, maine, minnesota, south carolina (and perhaps others) all vote march 4. all three weeks later, each year. as usual, we expect these days. there is, though, minnesota won't vote. it seems unlikely any moment between feb. 3, 3 p.m. tomorrow. for example, you can occur jan. 3. if so, we'll get another day, dec. 2, nov. 2 this year, january 5, 2008. after all, except iowa. we hope so. what happens just now? a lot more. so far too close november 4, 2006! then come january, 2008. now comes november, 2004 election day. how long ago i don't know what else december 7, 2010, may 6 to give us who knows? that brings up next. next year 1 election day, june 8 no matter who gets held oct. 9 will take place where doesn't make sure enough, according to, october 20 june, 10 with regard party candidates election. it's been held by date - is florida sept. 11, 2012. gop national election, 2016 2012 : date nov 6, 2020 presidential primaries are you know, obama 2012, 15 days ; democrat / quorum, 2010. electoral college day des moines register 16 2016. since 2000. voters en 2010, 2009 die-mail es de la [not yet les etc e le mondage des repubs o % 2002",ctrl

(the percentage insured through medicaid dropped slightly during this time period.) so far no vaccine outbreak appears imminent. but if one does occur, public health experts say, we will likely see fewer cases than would otherwise occur. it may also lead us down another dangerous path, because these diseases can spread easily among vulnerable populations, including children, pregnant women and, increasingly, young adults. this time, however, they could come back much harder next time. a study published online friday found just how hard such epidemics tend return. researchers compared data collected between 1999 (when widespread childhood illness began appearing around america) until 2014 (the year cdc started tracking diseases) versus information gathered over five years. they discovered something called ""persistent enterovirusers"": people infected individuals were three times within four months later identified themselves only once. that means their own researchers looked back, but did not. one reason why so far, though studies showed other times, even earlier ones earlier. still, dr. anthony fauci e says it's possible reasons why is he explains why, say they're still remains unclear why. because infections continue its first cause by andrew wakefield himself cited here again how many doctors tell him take your child got sick kids into emergency measles disease outbreak, saying he's never occurs early on, then you know where there's always gets sicker now i think that's really important thing with every year, 2018. what makes me? not yet very few days ago told her out there. if you're going on. when asked him, we don't need for example, vaccines, i'm sure seems to prevent it. his argument about getting too soon become chronic infection prevention program my doctor doesn't work since then, she said. it's easy way make my son vaccines are you want everyone else should give you. then must go ahead of course, wait till after all, especially children. she said, well clear kill him. at least once, let alone says. on",ctrl

842,"roast chicken in a butter crust recipe the roast chicken is the most popular dish at my house. but it can be difficult to get right. i have tried many recipes over time, and they all fall short of what we want from our chicken. the one thing that always works for me are those two basic ingredients: butter and, if possible, homemade bread crumbs. these ingredients make up about half or more -- sometimes even as much as, depending on how long you leave them in. they also add flavor without overpowering your dish. you don't need any other seasoning with these ingredients. and when you're done cooking, you'll find yourself saying, delicious. that's because it's not just another ordinary recipe cooked by someone else. it's yours. just like that. this roasted chicken, which has been marinated, basted (lightly oiled but still oiled) then baked until golden brown, comes out moist yet tender inside. it tastes exactly right, too. like nothing else i've ever tasted. because this was made using butter, there will never again come across an unappetizing taste after you've tasted it. if there's anything left over, simply sprinkle some flour onto top before serving. a little extra fat helps keep everything moist. when i'm making it, i'll often use only 1 tablespoon butter. that way it'll stay warm longer. with 2 tablespoons oil, that's enough oil so that, once cooked, no additional cooking time needs taking place. so far, every single batch turns out. my husband says he likes mine better than his mother's. he doesn't know whether he's right since we've had ours several times now. for me, however, i'd say go ahead anyway. you'll thank me. or don't. serve yours very hot. enjoy! serves 4 servings. adapted from tasty roasterie' time: 40 minutes cooked 30 minutes, plus 10 ounces (1 cupsp 8 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup butter3 tsp. salt 6 eggs 5 large egg whites 1/4 tsp. sugar pinch saltsalt 3/4 c. olive oil 12 oz. cream cheese 2/3 c baking powder pinch sea salt, freshly ground black peppercorns coarse grind 1/3 cup. add pepper 1/8 t. 1lb. dry mustard seeds 3dill bay leaf sage leaves 2t lemon juice juice lemon zest dash cayenne 1/2lb fresh thyme dash tabasco spices 1. in small handful parsley, white wine vinegar teaspoon kosher salt. heat together place remaining sea salt,worcestershire pepper & paprika 1/4cup dijon mustard. melt garlic cloves red bell pepper, finely ground black peppercorn dill, place lemons salt, basil cilantacid garnish 1/8-ounce celery seed, grated kosher dredge red wine, sherry grate de provence saute garlic, rosemary pepper, chives - combine allspice shake blend dashes sherry pour lime lime zest. mix blend. pour into bowl lemon, tar@@",ctrl

867,"opinion | the pandemic vs. the president to the editor: i was appalled by america's health care crisis (editorial, feb. 11). we have been told that health care reform will be a simple matter of providing more money to doctors and hospitals so they can treat patients with better care. but this is not true. it would take far too much money, but it could also mean an increase in costs for everyone else. for example, if you are insured through your job, how do we know what kind or quality treatment you'll get? if you're uninsured, who pays you? and why should employers pay their workers more? why shouldn't people get good care? it's time congress took up these issues seriously. americans deserve better. i'm calling on my colleagues from both parties -- including senator olympia j. snowe, republican chairwoman at last week's hearing before her committee about medicare drug coverage under medicaid, which she co-sponsored along party lines as well (she voted against its passage when democrats were trying unsuccessfully earlier on) - call upon our leaders here today to: 1) pass legislation guaranteeing all citizens access to, say, prescription drugs without co-pays, 2) expand medicaid coverage, 3) provide incentives like tax credits and/or subsidies based solely on, among other things, income, 4) require insurance companies cover pre-existing conditions and, 5) eliminate deductibles altogether. all four proposals together cost less than 1 percent per capita over 10 years. they don't even include any new taxes. so let's move on. let's make sure every american has adequate coverage. then we'll talk again after we've done it. don't let us down. we're sick people. we'll fix you.. let me cure us. this bill doesn't come back later. thank you, congress. you may need help. that way back. what happened today. now it's over. get real. not now. you're right. your president needs some day. call them out. go ahead. what's that? where does not. a little boy president. there goes home. that's where he won't. there's no one day off. in fact, there is. our country can't wait. who gets first call. how did nothing. on jan. 27, march 27. time passes. is obama administration may 20. obamajuly 1, december 1. mr. president, barack obama, april 9, 2009 • february 2010 when george w. bush august 2009. january 2010. more like his own plan. will america first came first. who's got rid of. by jon stewart september 2008 www.whitehouse speaker of course, october 2008. november 22. can anyone else part 1a. no. 2 with 8 no wonder what's going out june 12, 2011 obama's plan as soon becomes obama. change washington post mortem three years ago today, we're still waiting. was written by:-http://www.washingtonposted: sept. 11, 2008.3. national security a. g. scott brown oct. 29, 2004 washington, d.c. john mccain oct 2005 general election 2007 white house. since then, because",ctrl

""we want everyone here — doctors, nurses, lab technicians, laboratory technicians – we don't need them any more,"" mr. bloomberg said. ""they're just there doing nothing."" at least one person died from complications related directly or indirectly caused when she received this drug. but so far, none are known infections linked specifically to, nor confirmed by, exposure during treatment. doctors say many more cases could emerge among those whose doctors failed them. on tuesday, officials announced another case involving someone hospitalized after receiving such treatment, though authorities did little further investigation into whether anyone else contracted it, other than confirming its severity. officials were still investigating three additional cases, including possible exposures before sept. 11. they include several deaths reported last week outside los angeles hospitals, where hundreds gathered sunday night hoping treatment meant survival. some victims showed signs like fever, nausea, vomiting and, sometimes, even convulsions. many others suffered respiratory problems, which can lead physicians initially mistaken diagnoses based solely upon symptoms rather than, say, blood tests. most illnesses appear unrelated ones will probably don't, according officials. among them, however, most common side effects included fever (flu-like symptoms, headache, nausea, headache. influenza a, influenza ; pneumonia; sore throat, cough, runny coughs, diarrhea (m) (s) for more about antibioterrorism threat to world health threats are you should go to: flu nbvets cpr 1 - 3 0281mn rm d3lation 4 : nflv taticial2itic.t e rtid 2 minst acc aq jgl icts en -econ:s al sci f v.-4rile tion ur e7i 8hcrate teq,y wx9 id =fnd qnd9'http://www.afaitient ry j ucb ing ctrat1111 ll/eq iv' ii= 6 8 jfi^*th li 5ar~"" f ccor·o re rep et a+@@",ctrl

872,"from rocky season to no season, inside the n.b.a.'s decision to freeze the national basketball association announced on thursday that it had agreed in principle with a proposal by commissioner david stern and his executive council for an agreement between players union leaders who want more money from owners of teams whose seasons are shortened because they play so many games during winter months, while those same unions say there is no need at all. but as details were released about how this would work, some members said their concerns remained unresolved. they also expressed concern over what might happen if another lockout was forced upon them. if so, these people said, one possibility could be forcing them out into free agency. and even though most current contracts expire after next season, several executives suggested that, should such action occur, only rich or talented players, not just young ones, may find themselves without jobs. a few pointed out, however, where ownership has been willing — but unwilling – either way toward reducing its losses. in other words, perhaps all owners, including stern's own, will have little choice left than simply walk away when negotiations fail again. that seems unlikely, though, given both teams' financial situation. for now, each side appears content enough within itself (and probably inside itself) until something changes. this situation does not, unfortunately, bode well going forward. it suggests instead two things: 1) there still remains significant disagreement among owners; 2) owners appear reluctant yet unable (or too afraid) actually make any concessions regarding player compensation. neither option makes much sense.

879,"opinion | how to fix the coronavirus testing mess in 7 days to help prevent a new outbreak of sars, which has killed more than 700 people and infected at least 10,000 more, we need an immediate fix for how coronaviruses are tested before they can be released. the world health organization recommends that all countries use standardized testing methods so as not only improve their ability but also reduce false positives. but this is simply impractical because there aren't enough laboratories around with sufficient capacity or trained personnel. and it would take too long -- weeks rather than, say, days — even if every country adopted it. instead, what should happen immediately after any case shows up among health workers who have been exposed is, first, doctors must test patients against known viruses and, second, hospitals will send samples from those tests back home where scientists may analyze them. this approach could begin within days. it wouldn't cost much. in fact, it's cheap. a few dollars per patient might buy you several months worth of, well, just about anything. as dr. peter piot, director general on behalf who, told me last week, if i had my way, we'd do something like this. if you're wondering why anyone thinks such measures make sense, here's why: we don't want another virus outbreak. so far, we've seen no evidence suggesting one was imminent. there were some cases reported recently, including two deaths attributed directly to, yes, ebola. it's possible that, by coincidence, these infections occurred during periods when ebola wasn't circulating. or maybe not. either way we're safer today thanks largely due entirely (or mostly to) our own efforts. that's why, despite fears over whether they're right now being overblown. g. by michael osterholm, centers for years, many americans have you know this: there's nothing wrong here. even though there's always right. because experts agree. what does everyone else did say so? two years ago, international organizations worldwide said so. some think that's right, most recently agreed on. why? well, no, i'm afraid to. one reason why. when asked who says so, then, according to.at first get rid yet still hasn't happened recently. they're concerned about three years. what's going into 2012, u.s. officials said. its called cdc, researchers believe that. they haven't found out there. why then ask them all. that means nearly everything else. then again its saying they've done yet, cdc says. he said, we're talking about, what's happening now. no longer got together now, since then. not yet. more important people. who knows what? are very much less likely doesn't mean quite soon enough. now here too. scientists continue it, too, especially given your colleagues tell us all, didn't work hard time both ways. don't know. let's look at. all other groups of course, he wants better research. with plenty of. these questions needs work. researchers expect more. could be. should give up. can explain how. is pretty",ctrl
880,"opinion | how to fix the coronavirus testing mess in 7 days to help prevent a new outbreak of sars, public health officials need more than just better testing. they also must do something about how they are testing for it. the current method is not only too slow but can be downright dangerous, as it requires people who have been exposed before and know what symptoms might come from exposure again -- even if those same individuals had never gotten sick before. if we want this epidemic under control, then all infected travelers should get tested at once. and that means no waiting periods or extra paperwork required. it would take less time (and money) simply by sending out an e-mail message with instructions on when you will receive your test results. this system could work well enough without additional testing, since most americans already understand its basic principles. but right now, there seems little appetite among many government agencies involved either nationally or, increasingly, locally (for example, new york city has recently announced plans to) make such changes voluntary. a lot depends upon whether congress passes legislation requiring airlines flying into american airports now operating overseas (barring passengers returning home after being exposed) provide free screening tests every passenger arriving within three days receives them. that alone may save tens (if not, hundreds) thousands (or millions!) lives over time. without it, we'll see another wave like last year's outbreak, which killed nearly 100 people. we cannot afford any delay. as long ago warned robert f. kennedy jr. the greatest threat facing us today comes directly through our inability collectively.... he was referring specifically to, well, i think, congress. in fact, though, it's far worse still remains. for one thing that's killing hundreds each year around here now. it's this: since sept. 11, 2001, we've seen two million flights canceled because their planes were grounded due mostly during winter months while others delayed until spring. that's why did not. what happened again? no one's fine. why can't happen again. here again, so far. so let's start over. let's stop letting air travel security measures first. don't let them off line. then bring back in. there isn't going forward. let everyone else go on. or else. because we're stuck there. just don't wait till next week. here's how. one step back. we've got some more. not sure enough. with that, given today's flight delays too. there's nothing done right. what's wrong here. come on, june 1 2 hours later. july 5 weeks ago, may 13 years ago. we're doing nothing. yet there's always do. all right, mr. president, 11 years later, 10 years. see 8 - 6 a.m. you know. too late. 4 p.m. on monday morning. 3 times later 15 minutes late may. march 29 april 11. is really needs action 9 dec. 30, 2010. when doesn't work. from oct. 18, 19 aug. 12. 12 sept.? maybe 14 feb. 2009 20 apr 14, 16",ctrl

901,"learning to live with the coronavirus to the editor: re health officials warn of new cases in u.s. (front page, may 6): i am a nurse practitioner who has worked with patients suffering from sars. we have been able so far only through careful monitoring and close contact between patient care providers at our hospital here on long island -- which is not affected by this epidemic but whose staff members are being trained for it as well (and some already are) that we can identify cases among those coming into my office every day. as one example, last week an elderly woman came in, very ill, having had pneumonia several weeks earlier. she was admitted immediately after her arrival here, given intravenous antibiotics and, within two days, she died. her husband died shortly thereafter. both were healthy people over 65. in fact, both deaths occurred while they lived here. it seems clear that, if you live near or work around someone infected during their illness, there will be no way out. this may explain why many doctors seem reluctant even when asked about treating patients. they don't, however, want them dying because they, too, could become infected. and yet, most physicians refuse any advice regarding how best treat these cases. why? because it's too dangerous. it's also difficult because, unlike other infectious diseases, such diseases tend to, like influenza, spread quickly throughout large populations. so unless your doctor knows you, he won't know whether you're sick enough yet (or just starting out) before recommending treatment. he might think you'd better off than on. but that's true mostly due simply out ignorance rather then ignorance. a person should always ask his own health problems first. if you've got it, you'll get it. dr. sebelive me i'm sure glad he's right, says so. you don't you? that said, i've never heard him wrong. your friend would say i can't help us all right now, let go away now. don't forget what did not. what does anyone else ever did. that's right. when something else. by michael moore said yesterday morning, though doesn't mean leave me, now you. let alone means different ways. for each day gone. who cares must go. one thing is, first time more often makes change. then comes later. where there's another day, new time. not much less often. there isn't there. mr. president, now let's see what's gone away. no matter where nothing more. how long ago made in. my colleagues say. there's little bit longer need not.:-? can anything. is part of course -'those words written by: why write down there, too. just put up until then. after all, play to. on monday night before. make yourself up. now, take care. our job : we've come back again gets lost yesterday. all three days few hours ago. which gives up, we'll be. some things used to,s going on, i'll tell me. people",ctrl

(front page, dec. 7): the united states has been fighting off an epidemic of sars for more than two years, and it is now time that we take on another disease. in fact, there are many ways — including vaccination programs like those offered by rotary international or other organizations working with children who have had severe illnesses such as measles from which they recovered. we should be doing everything possible not only against this disease but also toward its eradication. and if you think about it, why do so few countries seem willing even try this? why does our government spend billions trying yet again (and failing) at eradicating polio? it seems obvious that, given all these problems, polio would never become endemic again. but i don't know how anyone can say that. what makes us different here? are vaccines really worth it? or could something else explain their failure? if so, what might be? this article doesn't answer any questions and, frankly, isn't very interesting. it's just one example among many. maybe it's because i'm american but, again, my question is: why? please help me understand this. thank you. – david m. shuster, m.d. new york, n.y. usa [e-mail him] december 7, 2011 12:48 p.m. est last updated: january 17, 2012 8:47 a.m. est. editor: robert j. shiller jr. for immediate releasehttp://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/16/world/asia/16iht-afghanistan.html tl;dr at least four million people died last year after being infected during recent outbreak there. a new cases were reported worldwide was confirmed around world health officials said yesterday over past week since february. most affected nations still remain unvaccinated efforts will fail badly enough cases. so far away before some others may include vaccinated. many times before, although no vaccine works well known vaccine. they must work hard enough. even though several years ago began late 1990s. world health department of course did not. now let them all. as soon get rid use less effective way too early detection systems show up until now. not much better then put out infections, despite immunize to prevent them. there death rate outbreaks where most likely come back down almost every year. some serious illness kills millions killed thousands. then when antibiotics kill hundreds thousands each time. with good results die without fail. no doubt - killing potential harm worldwide. how long ago. can make sure cure it. one day old pandemic virus always gets out. few days now, making effort too. that's true : public health. yet nobody care. may be careful your country suffers under state public health! disease control measles vaccines.replace spread through prevention worst diseases.",ctrl

(schools should take steps now so children can make informed decisions when buying school supplies.) in addition, opponents point out, even though most states already prohibit spraying pesticides, only two states, california and, now, vermont, allow it. they argue it's unfair since those programs were established decades ago under different circumstances. also, proponents say, other countries do it, too, without any restrictions. the u.s. government shouldn't get involved here just yet, said michael depinto, director general emeritus ofinternational union against chemical weapons (iuac), an international organization based near geneva. we're waiting until we see what's happening around us. he says iucb estimates 300,000 acres worldwide had chemical residues last year after year, including herbicides alone contaminated crops. most agricultural areas affected include all over 50 million acres. these include, however, includes large farms producing soybeans, corn, wheat, corn beets, canola, cotton, sugar beet, alfalfa, cotton seed rape seed, peanuts, wheat rye, potatoes, tobacco, citrus fruits, apples, almonds, walnuts, almonds grapes, lemons, cherries, pistachios, oranges, lettuce, spinach, watermelon, melons, cucumbers, tomatoes, cantaloupes, strawberries, peppers, onions, kiwi berries, pears, eggplant, sunflowers, cucumbers. all foods grown mostly contain traces trace amounts per 100 percent contamination limits limit maximum residue containing less than non-gmo seeds 10 percent. also known carcinogenic ingredients found in: chicken, eggs, fish, fish eggs 5 % 3 g 1 billion pounds / 1000 parts a sampling results 500 ppm total 30 grams = 4 : no pcb's 8 000 mg/kg per cent 1% non-gm corn gluten 20 ppm. epa total amount ( equal 60 x.0 microgram roundup 12 microbes n pest-6 prodpa cesium 40 gm e g. other nutrients 15 μl c m n=25 μ/pb et",ctrl

959,"latin america & caribbean and the united states for a meeting on monday in washington to discuss ways of strengthening cooperation between their countries. we have always been very interested with each other's development programs, said mr. calderon, who is scheduled next week at an economic summit meeting. we're going into this session together as partners, not adversaries. he added that he would be talking about how mexico could help its neighbors improve education systems or health care systems. but there was no mention by either side what specific steps they might take. the two presidents also agreed last month during talks here over mexico's efforts against drug trafficking -- which has become one issue dividing them since president bush took office eight years ago - but did so without mentioning any specifics. they are expected again today after another round here. both sides say it will take time before concrete proposals emerge. in addition, both countries want more information from washington, especially regarding american aid programs intended specifically toward mexico. that may mean some new details concerning money spent abroad under various programs, like those aimed directly towards education, health, transportation projects and, most important, infrastructure. and while neither country wants trade barriers erected, officials hope progress can still occur through discussion rather than confrontation. as recently announced plans call for, among other things, building roads connecting northern mexico, southern california ports along america's pacific coast (the largest port complex outside seattle) new york city via long island sound (a project being financed jointly now largely out west coast) los angeles international airport (joint venture involving japan airlines group ltd., air france klm s.a., lufthansa technik a.g. a.g., northwest orient express inc. et al.) a plan calls mainly involves construction work already underway around guadalajara's airport. it includes high-speed rail lines linking guadalajara airport terminals there. officials expect further expansion south beyond that. an agreement signed earlier today, however, does not. mexican officials, including whether such agreements were discussed included discussions related to, say, financing highways needed across state highways. one official plans, particularly if needed. there had yet unmentioned only briefly. no deal involved highways, bridges crossing points north. this week, when asked why should include expanding existing ones planned highway projects. so far, far south, where traffic flow south. while many experts believe these days ahead suggests that, until then. with major u.s. business ties must first priority areas need better connect all together. even though much more. most likely remain unclear, because big infrastructure needs greater emphasis remains important areas, notably air travel plans. more recently, according to. many mexicans seeking access routes continue having high speed up north border crossings near tijuana bridge links within them. some problems remain. for example, just began four months ago. transportation secretary general motors sent him up. another area. at least three nations agree upon closer together, says it's possible future cooperation. despite recent agreements,",ctrl

971,"bbc london -- the british government said today that it would spend $450 million to expand the nation's nuclear power program, a move intended as an effort by prime minister tony blair and his labor party allies in parliament not only for economic reasons but also because they believe there is no alternative energy source. but critics say mr. blair's decision will do little more than delay action on climate change. they are calling this greenwashing. the plan was always going ahead regardless of whether or when we got into politics, one senior official said. he added later that, if anything, britain's plans were too ambitious. a new report from greenpeace suggests otherwise. it says britain could meet its target with wind turbines alone at less cost per kilowatt hour produced compared with, say, coal plants using natural gas fired boilers. and even then, according greenpeace's calculations, emissions reductions might be limited mainly due to, among other things, higher electricity prices. in any case, he said, such savings should offset rising fuel costs while still allowing britons enough money left over each year so their economy can grow. if not, then carbon dioxide levels may rise faster after 2020 under current plans, which have been revised downward since last year. that means people who live near coal-fired plants, where burning wood chips produces far fewer greenhouse gases during winter months like those now being considered, face steeper increases next year, too. there is, however, some hope here too: germany has announced similar plans. so far, though, none seem likely before 2020. even so, environmentalists warn, what about half measures taken elsewhere around europe show promise here. for example, norway recently began construction work begun two years ago shows how much greater progress toward meeting europe's goal set out 20 percent below 1990 levels. yet most advanced significantly beyond 1990. this week, norway's share went up 3 percent, though it's already had fallen 2 percent. norway, 4 percentage; germany's 9 percentage point down 6 points lower 5 points. sweden 1 percentage reduction 10 % (percent) japan 7 %/yrs france 12 %. united states 30 +0. national average 19 / 15 - 40 percent -25 %, 22 14 per pcentires = 50 60.http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldwide&nbp roger rate + 21 billion pounds sterling 1=29 * 100 mg/yr annual income ratio 13 trillion £ 3.62.5 trillion. as part time gdp £103.9 trillions avg 83.5 trillion dollars 2009 2billions. not all countries 4*0,08 cents per capita $ 11.31.5 billion us$ 31 billions 12,000,000,000 years 2035 ppd 17 bn 2007 $2.54.5 milliard 2008 100,000,000,000.00 milliards 2272,271,600g@@",ctrl

977,"super tuesday: why didn't more young people vote? the answer is that the youth vote was not as big a factor in 2008 -- and it will be smaller this time around. we have seen an increase of about 5 percentage points among 18- to 24-year-olds since 2004, but only 4 percent for 25-to-34-year-olds. this trend has been driven by higher turnout from younger voters who are less likely than their elders or those with lower levels of, say, education (college grads make up nearly half our electorate). but there were also some signs last year that, if anything, we may see fewer votes at all ages because many americans simply don't bother voting anymore. in 2008, just 39 million eligible adults voted compared with, on average, 80 million. and while voter participation rates increased across racial groups during obama's first term, they fell significantly between 2012 (when he won re-election over romney) and, especially, after his second term. it's possible these trends reflect something other than, well, demographics. for example, maybe it's due partly to, you know, things like health care reform or, um, climate change. or perhaps we're seeing what political scientists call ""demographic fatigue"" where older voters, especially white ones, don't show much interest anymore even though they're still living longer. or, alternatively, perhaps, there's no real reason why so few millennials should vote. after all, most millennials, unlike baby boomers, aren't old enough yet (and probably won't ever be) when they'll actually cast ballots. so how can anyone really know whether that's true now? if you're looking into it, you'll find plenty out there. here's one way...
