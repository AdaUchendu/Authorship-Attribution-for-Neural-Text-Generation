""china has been challenging japan's growth assumptions for a long time,"" said the authors, who were joined by jeffrey wasserstrom, michael byng, and ken takahashi of harvard's langston hughes school of government. they concluded, however, that china would be underestimated in the long run in the short term, given that it would need to endure low inflation, near-zero growth and ""strong external demand."" ""compounding the challenge of fiscal stimulus and fiscal repair are the challenges that japan faces in a post-war world,"" the authors said. however, china continues to offer the alternative to policies which have produced very low growth. they added: ""the study demonstrates that china's fiscal policy needs to be reformed in order to meet its growth targets."" the authors highlighted china's efforts to improve its digestive system, which they said is still a ""neglected"" part of its infrastructure, and encouraged japan to move more quickly.

""we can't, for example, stop a person doing what he or she wants to do,"" he said. it's not going to happen. if people are at serious risk of having a cmv outbreak, there is an important lesson to be learnt, so that we stop people getting the infection and if it is not stopped it will be much worse in future. it is not a pandemic. it is now a financial pandemic with economic consequences for the population. professor ham added that the strain of the virus, which causes joint pain and fever, could be as serious as the new ebola scare, which has seen one person die in nigeria and three have been infected in the uk. he said there were also ""worrying indications"" that the outbreak is spreading through hospitals and healthcare centres around the world. a number of countries have reported increased cases of the illness, including the us, italy, germany and spain. professor ham said: ""we are now in the position where we have to say to the public,' we have to be prepared, we have to be prepared and we have to take action now '."" the current outbreak in south america will be most significant in south america, where people have had a high number of cases.",fair

""we can't keep an individual from wanting to spread the virus,"" he said. the chinese diplomat was referring to the united states, where president barack obama has proposed putting a $300 million buffer on the $3.8 billion in annual military aid to the south american nation's military. the military spending comes as american military leaders have been working to keep the virus from spreading to other countries. most of the us budget requests for that year included $13 billion in funding for the military's anti-zika response. the us military has been using the money to beef up its response, with the department's chief of staff gen. ray odierno telling reuters last week that the military has already completed a $224 million effort to fight zika. the us is also moving forward with a $4.6 billion study to identify zika virus threats in the blood of infected males, as well as in the body. the current zika virus outbreak has infected more than 3,000 people worldwide since it first emerged in brazil in march. it is unclear how long this outbreak will continue to spread in the us. there have been reported cases in canada and at least 10 in spain. the world health organization has said it expects the virus to spread to other countries in the western hemisphere, although most of the cases have been in latin america. cnn's kevin wang and pamela boykoff contributed to this report.",fair

34,"the movies that predicted an outbreak like coronavirus were mostly based on the idea that infections could spread in the united states. but many of the movies they predicted were based on the assumption that the first cases of an infection would occur in the united states, not in other countries. that assumption was widely debunked. the report also found that the who's global pandemic alert was based on the belief that the world was on the brink of a global pandemic, and that the virus was not yet contained. the new report, which addresses the possibility that the virus could still emerge in the coming years, relied on information from six global agencies that advise the u.n. security council on the threat of pandemics. they developed a risk analysis for the risk of pandemic in order to determine which countries should be most at risk. the united states and canada were the most vulnerable countries to pandemic threats. china, india and iceland, all of whom were in the highest risk groups, were the most vulnerable. the report warned that a pandemic was possible in the united states, and not in the world. a pandemic in the united states would take place almost every three years, with the united states and the rest of the world expected to experience a spate of outbreaks, the report said. the first wave of outbreaks would start in the summer of 1918, and the next wave would start in summer 1919 and continue until the end of this century. the first outbreak of aids in the united states during the great depression was attributed to the flu vaccine. the last flu pandemic, in 1968, came from the swine flu virus. the report suggested that the risk of a pandemic in the united states was still the same today as it was in the 1918 and 1919 pandemics. dr. douglas shulman, director of the center for global health security at columbia university, said that the report was ""very compelling"" and that it showed that the risk from a pandemic was much higher in the united states than in other countries. the report said that the risk of pandemics in the united states was so great in the past, that the only way to avoid a pandemic was to invest in public health programs and public education. dr. shulman said he was encouraged by the report's findings.

""this suggests that the us was at greater risk of a major fire,"" the climate scientists said. the study, which is published in the journal nature climate change, also found that australia's previous hotter-than-average winter was also linked to a rise in wildfires. in the southern flinders ranges, the number of fires had increased by more than a million in the past two years, the study said. the study also found that australia's fires were more intense in the spring, when temperatures soared. scientists said they hoped the findings could lead to better predictions of future fires. ""this study shows that climate change is changing what is happening in australia,"" said professor mark bellis, a fire scientist at the university of melbourne. the idea that this might be due to global warming is just that bit more significant. but it's extremely hard to know if this is because of global warming or really because of climate change. more than 40 years of global warming and the associated melting of ice and snow have caused the antarctic peninsula to grow more rapidly than it has in the past, experts say. but the researchers said this was likely to be due to human activities, which contributed to the recent emergence of fires. the study was funded by the australian research council, the australian research council and the national science foundation. dr martine beer, head of the climate change research program at the australian national university, said the study used previous research by the university of melbourne's centre for climate and environmental research.

104,"an australian thief used a fishing rod to steal a versace necklace worth more than $300,000, police said tuesday. the 19-year-old attacker, who was not identified, was jailed for two to 10 weeks for the crime. the versace necklace, which the british fashion house said belonged to the woman's late father, was unearthed by maintenance workers searching for the family's old home in the australian state of queensland. ""the man has ripped out the whole thing,"" detective inspector tony langdon, of the brisbane police service, told reporters. the man had placed a piece of wood in the hole in the ground to keep it from being swallowed. it was unheard of before the man attached some of his own wood to the outside of the palm of his hand. he then grabbed the expensive necklace with his bare hands, pulled the trigger, and took it with him. it's not known if the victim was the victim's father. the jewelry was found by a maintenance worker who had been called the following day to clean the hole. police said the thief was ""extremely lucky"" as he had not realised how long it had been missing. they said he had robbed a gold coin purse worth about $3,500 before fleeing. the thief also stole a gold necklace worth about $80,000. ""when you get a theft like this it's really worrying,"" queensland police service inspector langdon said. it's hard to believe someone would do that because it's not usually that much of a risk. it's usually somebody coming in overnight to take something. police said the man is likely to appeal the sentence. the versace necklace is valued at between $400,000 and $500,000, and police have offered a reward of up to $250,000 for information leading to the return of the jewels. the versace jewels are displayed at the versace store in milan, italy, on may 24, 2006. photos: ap photo / alberto pizzoli originally published as thieves steal $300,000 artwork from versace house in queensland ""he's not going to get away with it,"" inspector langdon said. but he's got a lot of people out there thinking they could take some of that jewellery back to the family. police said a reward of up to $250,000 was being offered for information leading to the handover.",fair

""if an area could be protected for future generations then it would be the perfect place to start,"" he said. the study also looked at how flooding affected the thames wet tropics which have been in decline since the late 1990s. the research found that the river had risen by more than 10 times since the 1940s, while other areas in the thames delta had fallen more",fair

165,"'folks don't feel safe' the nhs, doctors and other health professionals should be allowed to judge the ethics of ""professional"" doctors, says a cross-party group of mps. the commons public accounts committee says the current system is broken and patients are having to wait longer for treatment. it also says doctors should be given more responsibility for evaluating patients before giving advice. the mps, from newcastle upon tyne, argue that the current system is not fit for purpose. they say that the nhs has not been working in proper patient-centred interests. in a submission to the committee, nhs england says that it is committed to ensuring its clinical staff are fairly represented in assessing clinical decisions. it says the responsibility for assessing decisions rests with the nhs. the committee says that ""new training,"" which allows doctors to review patients themselves, is needed to improve the quality of care. it also says that the nhs should be ""fully empowered"" to decide whether or not to give advice. ""we are concerned that this is not currently being carried out effectively,"" it says. even if doctors were to have the information needed to make informed decisions about treatment, such actions would be incompatible with their duties to the public, it says. the mps want a new service for doctors who specialise in mental health. currently, a third of doctors do not have a specialist clinical role either. the committee is calling on the government to make sure that health professionals are equipped with the skills and experience to assist with diagnosing patients in a timely fashion. it also calls for more training for all nhs doctors and doctors to ensure that patients are ""assessed by professionals, not by clinical judgments."" but the mps say that there is not enough support for all doctors to be able to offer this. they say that doctors should have more knowledge of the medical world and ""the context in which they operate, and the ethics of this."" it also wants to protect the nhs from being used as a ""back door"" to private companies, which would make it more difficult to understand why people are being treated in the nhs. medical director professor ian olver said: ""this important report highlights the importance of the nhs for patients to receive treatment in whatever way they can. it also highlights that what is needed in the nhs is better patient education and training, ensuring doctors are confident and have the confidence to recognise the unique role they have to perform in care.",fair

""having been raised in a tribal community, what i'm looking for is to find a sense of belonging,"" courtney nuttall, author of ""tribal nation"" argues, ""the tribe is being left behind."" in one of his theories, nuttall suggests that the tribal members are left out of the process because they are not eligible for federal tax benefits because of their race. the tribe instead uses their tribal language to get to know the wealthier members of the tribe. the people of the tribe know the tribal members better than the other members. nuttall notes that nuttall's theories are based on the same assumptions that underlie many tribal members' disenfranchisement. ""one member of the tribe has gone from being the most qualified tribal member to a person that was the least qualified,"" he writes. he also believes that the tribe's culture and traditions cannot be reconciled with the legacy of ""what's wrong with our tribe."" ""tribal members don't have a divine right to be tribal members and, in fact, they have been living in isolated circumstances for centuries,"" nuttall says. there's no reason to think tribe members should have a personal problem unless it's a personal issue. what nuttall and courtney nuttall seem to agree on is that the ""forgotten tribe"" needs a way out. ""we have a way to go forward,"" nuttall says. we have to grow up. we have to learn to respect our tribes and then learn to disagree with them. because they are right here to stay. root's thesis is not the only one out there that's got a problem with the ""forgotten tribe,"" but there's a whole lot more to the story. this article originally appeared on er: 'white patriarch' uses politics to rally tribal dispute",fair

""we have many people who have no income, or when their income is less, it is difficult to survive,"" said rodolfo garcia caetano, an official of the agriculture ministry. the brazilian government has set up a commission to address the issue but said that the majority of those affected had been receiving little or no assistance. the country is the world's largest exporter of beef, and brazil has been the backbone of the country's agriculture industry for decades. the number of cattle ranchers in brazil has dwindled by more than 90 percent over the past decade to around 5,000 due to a drought. the country is still recovering from several years of recession, which prompted the government to introduce a huge programme to make agricultural production more efficient and to give priority to the country's rural poor. that subsidy made major contributions to brazil's overall economic growth in the second quarter of 2012, with gross domestic product (gdp) rising 2.8 percent over the year. the agriculture ministry said the worst drought in decades in brazil was particularly bad in the southern states of minas gerais and sao paulo, where the drought has forced thousands of people to leave their ranches. the government has also been trying to improve the country's agricultural production by cutting red tape and improving grain-growers' management systems. but it is facing repeated criticism from farmers and graziers who say the government has not done enough to tackle the problem of soaring food prices and poor farming practices. to combat the problem one ministry proposed that the government set up a research programme which aims to understand the causes of food prices to help people cope with it. they also said the country should work to improve infrastructure, particularly water networks and sewage plants, reduce carbon emissions and introduce a carbon tax. the ministry also said that it would set up a research program to help the poor and improve agriculture. the project will be funded by the government and the private sector. in a statement, the ministry said: ""the government will ensure the development of economic and agricultural sectors to create more jobs.""",fair

""unless we tackle the issue of cyclists riding without a helmet, we risk losing a generation of cycling enthusiasts to traffic fatalities and injuries,"" said dr maria newman, a research fellow at the university of york and the lead author of the study published in the british journal of sports medicine. the study also said that while other studies have suggested that motorcyclist deaths increase when people are on the move, the research showed little evidence that such an increase was due to better-designed cycle infrastructure and safer roads. the study was conducted by the government's road safety research unit (rrr), which advises the government on various transport matters. ""while traffic fatalities are a very visible part of the public transport network, it is important to remember that this research focuses on only a very small part of the population,"" said dr newman. it is only in the absence of reliable evidence that we can draw comparisons with our own research to properly assess the impact of motorcycle riding on road safety.",fair

308,"what is a bear market? after big swings in us stocks, investors have been left red faced over what to expect when the economy recovers. traders have reacted to last week's decision by the us federal reserve to raise interest rates from their record low of near zero. they are worried financial markets will start to look more like the 1930s, with fears of a potential crash, a severe recession and rising interest rates. analysis by graham tibbetts of s & p global market intelligence has shown one of the main areas of concern is slowdown in china. the country's official statistics bureau reported industrial output fell by 14.6% in february, compared with the same month last year. s & p global warned that if the latest industrial production figures were confirmed, ""we think the chinese economy may have experienced a serious slowdown in the second quarter of 2013."" ""market participants are taking these concerns into account,"" it said. the drop in industrial production and the increase in production prices will probably have more to do with the effects of the downturn in china than any slowdown in the us. on the streets of beijing, traders are already looking ahead to next week's second quarter gdp data. ""it will be interesting to see the impact of the rebound in china,"" says jim walker, a strategist at jpmorgan private bank. ""that will have a bigger effect on growth than the slowdown in the us,"" he says. china will release its official figures on friday, which will be closely watched by investors. standard chartered economists said the government would probably keep the official figure for the second quarter of the year below the key 7.5% forecast, but could still bring in a rise to 7.5%. the chinese gdp growth has been underpinned by better-than-expected bank lending and government subsidies. however, while china's economy is growing at a faster pace than its asian neighbours, the country's growth has been below potential. ""the situation in china will not necessarily reflect the real economy fundamentals,"" says mr walker. i don't think the underlying trend is to the same extent as the us, although it might be more of a cyclical slowdown. but the economy will grow because it is growing more strongly. all eyes are on the next round of us fed rate increases. ""the markets are expecting an increase at the end of the year, and we are expecting that in 2014,"" says mr walker.",fair

""as a result of the uncertainty that this impasse has created, we remain prepared to work constructively with the union and to avoid a lockout,"" nba spokesman mike bass said in a statement. in addition, the nbpa is committed to meeting our obligation to our players and to working with the union to reach a solution that is in the best interests of our league. the union has been negotiating with the players union since june in a bid to get them to accept a new agreement in their contract. without an agreement, the nba is scheduled to begin its regular season just three days before the first game of the 2010-11 season. the two sides have been unable to reach an agreement since july 31. ""the unions have a real, real chance to help the players, who are having a hard time,"" said stern, who has been working with the players union since 2000. at this point it remains unclear what the ultimate outcome of this dispute will be, both sides believe, and the whole thing is in jeopardy. ap basketball writer brian mahoney in new york contributed to this report. more nba basketball: https: / / apnews.com / tag / nbabasketball follow teresa m. walker at www.twitter.com / teresamwalker and dennis rodman at www.twitter.com / lowrydunndc",fair

""i think we were the first to realize that the kind of technological revolution we were seeing in the early years was not going to be a product of the pentagon,"" says joe clark, who co-founded jelly beans. with the advent of the internet, the u.s. military was looking to deploy military satellites to orbit. the soviet union had already sent a satellite into space. most of the technological advances of that era took place in the united states. for clark, who founded the company jelly beans in 1970, the apollo program was the first real breakthrough. this was not about the apollo program, it was about the way our country was going to change. now, clark says, people are looking for a new role for the apollo program. the program will help open up opportunities, while continuing to invest in science and technology. ""the apollo program has the potential to transform the way we think about space and space and to be part of that discussion,"" clark says. clark says he's not worried about where the program will go next. he says he hopes it will be a place where americans can meet and work and make new and exciting contributions. ""it's not about getting a new job, it's about getting back on the same page,"" clark says. we're all looking to be part of something bigger. the program marks the completion of a five-year design process. clark says the goal is to take the apollo program to the next level. the astronauts will travel at least one billion miles around the moon and back to earth. the mission is planned for 2024. click for more from fox .com. click for more from the wall street journal. click for more from wired.",fair
324,"jeff bezos just sold $1.8 billion worth of amazon stock. here's why the market should be nervous. here's the thing: a lot of people have been talking about amazon's stock price since it went public (it traded above $1,500 for the first time wednesday). that is, after a two-day rally, it's now worth about $206.7 billion, more than twice what it's just reached. but could amazon be about to go on a big bubble? if there's one thing that's likely to change in this bull market, it's that the tech industry has barely been paying attention. and while companies spend billions on research and development, they're the ones who spend the most. what's more, when companies spend money, they're the ones who make the most money. so here's a more fundamental reason. how much does the stock market really devalue? and if the market is going to go up, it's going to make it harder for the tech sector to make money. the tech sector's profits and valuations have been on a tear in recent years, with the s & p 500 up more than 70 percent since 2010, while the nasdaq has more than doubled. but this year, there's a growing number of tech companies that are also going public. last year, the nasdaq was down 7.3 percent, the s & p 500 was down 2.4 percent, and apple's stock was down 16 percent. amazon was up more than 9 percent the day after the market's close, most of which was due to the company's earnings report. amazon is also a huge consumer of gadgets; its revenue from every purchase is a huge amount of money. but its quarterly earnings were on a par with those of its competitors, and it reported another impressive quarter. that's also a sign that the tech sector is feeling more confident since amazon's stock jumped to $1,745. that's a huge amount of money for a company that is so dependent on online sales for revenue. the time has come for tech companies to be more cautious about investing heavily in the future, and for tech companies to be more cautious with that investment. tech companies shouldn't be investing in any tech stocks just yet. that requires buying them with far more wiggle room. but that's not a bad time to be diversified, diversified. cnnmoney (new york) first published september 27, 2016: 1: 24 pm et",fair

""using a natural source of sunlight, eels will collect data from the sun's atmosphere to study how the solar wind affects earth's magnetic field,"" said mr hart. this will inform new research in the future on how solar wind affects earth's magnetic field and provide another tool for understanding how it changes. the spacecraft will be launched from the kennedy space center in florida. it will stay in orbit for another five days before successfully returning to earth. at that time, it will provide important clues about how the solar wind affects the solar wind. if the mission works, the payload will be able to take measurements of the sun's magnetic fields as it will pass overhead, according to the nasa",fair

""the risk of infection is reduced when preppers persist in their current behaviour, as the virus does not have an adaptive host,"" said the study's author, dr. chris neff, a professor of microbiology at north carolina state university. the preppers may have been infected by the virus, but their immunity from colonization may have been compromised because of this, the study found.

""it doesn't make sense to be paying more to medicare than medicaid or anything like that, because medicare is not like that,"" he said. under the new proposal, states could apply for an exemption from the cuts, which could affect more than 30 million people. states typically use the money they receive from medicare and medicaid to cover all of their costs for the elderly. citing studies that have shown that people who get emergency care from the federal government spend far more overall on healthcare than those who do not, titley said the savings could be used to pay for additional social services for the elderly. the american nurses association, the largest union for nursing homes, said in a written statement that its members understand the scope of the problem. ""we have long supported the creation of an entitlement that benefits all seniors at low cost,"" said david w. reynolds, the association's president. but we think this approach is a step too far and we urge the administration to recognize that this is not the best use of taxpayer dollars. the association said it also would encourage all states to act to reduce access and decrease costs. ""we recognize that reduced access to care is the only way to reduce health care costs, and that changes could be more cost effective in these programs,"" reynolds said. but he added that the association ""is concerned"" about the potential impact of the proposal on care quality. ""we have concerns about the impact on quality,"" reynolds said. we have concerns about the potential impact on quality.",fair

""this is not a new treatment,"" said dr. jonathan lundgren, who led the research. but this is the first study by a large-scale study to show that, for the first time, it does not work. lundgren said the approach has a high death rate, which may mean that it may not work in patients with other types of cancer. ""it is possible that the enzyme that it is designed to target will be involved in the destruction of cancer cells,"" lundgren said. we have no firm evidence that this is feasible. if this works, lundgren and his colleagues would like to take this step. ""the enzyme is highly selective,"" lundgren said. if we can engineer its destruction by inducing the cell to grow with the cancer, then we've made it possible to destroy the cancer with this enzyme. we now want to see if this is feasible. currently, there is no approved treatment for the illness. but mtor-1 is being investigated as a treatment for cancer. the researchers believe it may be possible to use the protein to kill cancer cells before they are too toxic to kill. by putting the stem cells back in the tumor, they believe they can destroy the leukemia cells themselves. lundgren's team is currently testing the effect of mtor against a different type of cancer, lymphoma, and researchers are hoping that this approach will become a standard treatment in the future. ""we're optimistic that it will not be just a standard treatment,"" lundgren said. for the next decade or so, this will be the standard treatment and we'll see if it has a similar effect.",fair

""television is a very basic media, and it is not a way to help children learn or to improve their education,"" ho said. our findings suggest that it could be a critical factor in developing positive student behavior in schools and in our society. we've found that engaging children with a variety of programming, videos and tools may prevent them from performing at school. the study didn't test the effects of screen time on students who watched a real-life educational program but rather to see how they responded to a non-educational program. researchers plan to measure how students respond to educational programs during the following two years and then compare results for each program. ho is a professor of psychology at usc. she told usa today the study was similar to one that looked at the impact of viewing a tv program on kids' brain function. the study showed the ""real-life"" viewing of someone watching a fictional educational program affected the same brain activity as watching a real educational program. the researchers hope future research could show how similar programming might impact children's behavior in school.

""iran will respond when the iaea conducts new inspections,"" it added. iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the united states, israel, the european union and other nations fear it has a secret weapons program aimed at developing weapons. the united states has repeatedly pressed tehran to stop producing nuclear arms, saying that it would not have a negotiating position if other nations stopped the program. on thursday, tehran announced it would reduce the core of its uranium enrichment capacity to 3.5 percent, saying it would reduce this further to between 0.5 percent and 2 percent to boost enrichment. the current u.n. security council resolution is aimed at enforcing a six-month interim agreement to curb iran's nuclear program, which u.s. officials believe is intended to produce a nuclear bomb. iran denies western allegations that it is seeking to develop nuclear arms, insisting it wants to produce electricity for a growing population. the iaea said on thursday it had obtained information that iran planned to have two uranium enrichment plants and possibly more by 2015. the information, provided to the agency by the agency, is of ""high sensitivity,"" the agency said. according to the agency, iran had already started to convert its stockpile of high-grade uranium into its fuel rods. the iaea also said it had received information that iranian scientists were manufacturing nuclear fuel rods, uranium isotopes and an active centrifuge, a key component of nuclear weapons. the agency said it is in talks with iran on possible applications for iran to become a member of its nuclear non-proliferation treaty. reporting by marcus george; editing by jon hemming and jon boyle. / kevin liffey / ruth pitchford / kevin liffey",fair

622,"why oil prices are crashing and what it means for your pension millions of us with smaller pension pots will be forced to sell their property if the cost of living rises and the value of their homes is affected. our collective pension pots have grown by more than £2,600 a year since 1988, according to the office for national statistics. the value of our pots has more than doubled, reaching £1.7trillion last year. this has helped keep people living longer and helping to protect income from inflation, a report by investment firm hargreaves lansdown suggests. as a result, older people with large pension pots have seen their savings eroded by inflation. some £1.7 trillion was wiped off the value of their homes in the first ten years of the millennium. while the value of their homes has risen by £2,600, this has helped keep some of these pots intact. this is because the current rising prices have brought down the value of the pots in the past when the savings were being ploughed into a pension. as a result, pots with a deficit of at least £1 million have been in deficit for at least five years. this is because over time the value of their assets has increased. the pension deficit has grown by £600, from £1.7 trillion to £2.1 trillion. in other words, this means that people with large pension pots have been hit by inflation. the growth in the value of their pots has also been heavily affected by the rise in the price of oil. at the start of the millennium prices were rising by around 20% a year. ""the increase in the cost of living has led to a number of people becoming less comfortable about investing in their pension and therefore have put a number of them on a negative outlook,"" a spokesperson for hargreaves lansdown told the telegraph. even if you're buying an annuity you'll have to make sure you do your research and ask your bank if you can afford the income you have now. also, if you have a pension with the income you now have, you can only invest it in the stock market. if you do decide to sell your home, the value of your pots will increase. the increase in wealth will affect some people as the value of their property goes up - but will still be worth some £35,000 for someone with £100,000. and you will not have to worry about the next pensioner.",fair

691,"the queen is making her most serious misstep here. it may have been because of the inconvenience caused to her by sir john major delaying the arrival of her heir apparent, the earl of wessex. but the delay came too late, and her majesty's words were greeted with both glee and derision by jeers from the royal family. if sir john major were still in power, it would have taken a further 13 days for ministers to begin the process of formalising legislation to enshrine a new law on the royal succession. the new legislation was, it has to be said, unnecessarily long, and was largely rejected by the government. but the queen is determined to show she has tried. it would be a brave thing if she started to think about it before the implementation of the new law is complete. by then we will know precisely what the new law will say, and what it is likely to mean for the royal family. and the law must be clear enough for the new government to establish the new monarch as its head. we have seen many parallels with the way the queen's private secretary, sir alan reid, and her private secretary, sir richard dearlove, treated sir john major in the 1980s. sir alan was the architect of labour's policy on the falklands, a policy that was later dubbed ""mad."" sir alan was also the man who drew up the 1992 defence of the realm act, which set out a series of measures to curb the power of the monarchy. sir alan could not have been more different, he was much more willing and more prepared to speak out for the rights of the crown. in the past, sir alan has been critical of the government's handling of the falklands conflict, but he was also keen to discuss the need for reform of the house of lords. the queen is entitled to an honorary title such as knight of the garter, which recognises a distinguished and distinguished record of service to the nation. having acquired her title, the queen may wish to continue to do so. in the meantime, the queen is clearly worried about her future. in the run-up to her diamond jubilee, she will be wary that her husband, prince philip, will not be around to witness her making a wholly new start. until then, she will be one of britain's most loved monarchs.",fair

""[there are] a lot of good reasons for preventing new health problems, but we still haven't figured out how to make those things work,"" abel, who is also at the cleveland clinic, told the cleveland clinic. because the infectious disease is so common, experts recommend washing hands thoroughly, and using insect repellents instead. you don't want the germs into your mouth, you don't want them into the mouth. what you have to do is let the bacteria out and spread them, ""he said. in another study, researchers found that hand sanitizers were just as effective as antibacterial hand sanitizers at controlling the bacteria."" hand sanitizers are highly effective, but they do not eliminate all germs, ""said eric o'brien, a microbiologist at the university of minnesota who was not involved in the study. while they are safe, they are not enough. while they are much more important, the researchers warned that while hand sanitizers can actually do more harm than good.",fair

""this study reveals the significant public health burden that coronavirus has on college students and should spur action to prevent or respond to this growing epidemic,"" said dr. michael friedman, who led the study at new york university langone medical center. coronavirus infections are often treated with antibiotics and that can cause severe illness. it is best to prevent and treat coronavirus-associated infections not by preventing contact with infected individuals, but by treating at-risk patients. the cdc recommends that everyone who is infected with the infection seek medical attention immediately. coronavirus can be treated with antibiotics. the cdc estimates that up to 1 million americans contract the virus each year. the study also found that patients who were infected with the virus were significantly less likely to develop serious conditions. dr. david agus, of the university of florida said he was not surprised by the results. ""the rates of coronavirus infection in college students are inadequate,"" agus said. these results indicate that the coronavirus is a serious public health problem. the study authors cautioned that more research is needed, but the results suggest that college students should be aware of the importance of seeking medical attention if they're infected with the disease.

696,"how to improve your chances against coronavirus most people recover within two days and recover within three weeks, but there can be serious complications. there is no vaccine or treatment available for severe acute coronavirus, and the only treatment is a course of antibiotics. however, many people recover quickly and are able to carry on with their lives even after the infection has ended. anyone experiencing symptoms of the infection, which can be life-threatening, should consult their gp. most coronaviruses are spread by direct contact with an infected person's saliva or faeces - but most infections occur in the first five days after infection. for people with severe symptoms, the best course is to stay at home and visit their gp. a typical cold-like illness is called a viral pneumonia. the infection usually lasts around two hours. the body can then recover without antibiotics, and after that, the infection is usually gone forever. the main risk of contracting the virus in the first place is to the lungs, and it can be extremely serious. the virus can survive for up to a week, but if it does not, symptoms can develop very quickly. dr brian mccloskey, consultant in infectious diseases at nhs greater glasgow and clyde, said: ""the virus is spread by contact with saliva or faeces - but this can be a very serious illness. it is extremely important to be aware of the symptoms of the virus, and to seek medical advice if you develop any. the best advice is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water, stay away from your work or school and take your temperature at least one hour before you go to the toilet. it is important to follow nhs advice and stay away from your gp practice for the rest of the day. the latest figures show an increase in the number of people presenting to emergency departments in scotland for flu-like symptoms. experts say this type of flu, which includes flu-like symptoms, is increasing at an alarming rate. the number of people hospitalised with flu-like symptoms now stands at 642 - three times the number last winter. figures from nhs 24 show the number of people admitted to each hospital with flu-like symptoms has risen by almost half in the past week. figures suggest the number of people in hospital following the flu outbreak in scotland rose by almost a fifth on the same period last year.",fair

""if you have a very wealthy elite, which you think they should be, it will be perfectly legal for them to put money into your pension fund,"" he said. they will then have to show how much they have contributed to the pension fund in order to be able to justify the entitlement. and there's no way that means that they will have to pay back the money they have contributed. you have got to show you have done the right thing. a lot of people will say that they are cheats because they are cheaters. the fact is, they are a very sophisticated, well-organised organisation which uses all the tools at its disposal to try to avoid paying tax. it's clear to me that if this was not illegal, it would be very difficult to justify. the treasury has also brought in tough new rules to protect consumers. it will no longer have to tell consumers in the form of letters about what they owe. it will have to send them a notification letter demanding that it has stopped any payments to the banks. which means that it will no longer have to tell consumers more about the costs they face. and the rules will now be changed so that a claim can be made that they were trying to avoid paying tax. the law will also introduce new penalties to limit how much people can claim back. the treasury said: ""the banks are already being held to account for their actions. we want to make this a deterrent for people who break the law. in this particular case, we've decided to take the strongest possible action against those who tried to conceal their true financial dealings from the authorities and now are trying to get more powers to force people off their bank accounts. the treasury added that the new powers would not affect mortgage lending.",fair

""zika virus has been detected in almost every region of the world and not just in the us and caribbean,"" said the cdc. there have been no cases of zika transmission in the continental united states, but there have been isolated cases in africa, asia and latin america. the cdc says that because there is no vaccine or treatment for zika virus, the most likely route is through mosquito bites.

""millennials are increasingly becoming the wealthiest generation in the country,"" said peter g. peterson, the chief economist for the economic policy institute, a conservative think tank. they have a lot of savings, but they're not saving for retirement. they are saving for retirement. so when the baby boomers retire, we're going to see a lot of boomers retiring. the baby boomers are the generation with the highest debt, not the baby boomers. and the money they're borrowing from older generations may be a problem, since they are often not paying that back. ""the generation is borrowing more from the baby boomer generation than their parents were paying,"" mr. peterson said. in the past, the baby boomer generation was a lot more vulnerable to borrowing money from the baby boomer generation than the current generation. that happened over the last 50 years. the amount of debt a baby boomer can rack up is still a major issue. the same report found that nearly half of millennials can no longer afford college and university, and half have little savings. that means that these baby boomers are mostly not saving for retirement, of course. but they are getting in over their heads.",fair

""crddi is not adequately prepared for the challenges of future challenges,"" the report found, ""and it lacks the technology and training that is necessary to address these issues."" the rail industry also lacks a clear understanding of how to deliver the railroad's core technology, which is the railroad's reliability. according to the report, the railroad has only had one train from its manufacturing line, ct-1, since 2003, and ct-1 has been in service since 1981. the crddi report recommends that the crddi develop an automated system that would automatically update and retrofit an aging track.

""the divorce rate for women rose from 2.1 percent to 3.8 percent in the second quarter of 2007, compared to 2.7 percent for men,"" the study says. the divorce rate for men in the first three months of 2007 was also higher -- from 1.9 percent to 2.2 percent -- than for women in the previous year. the researchers also found that the divorce rate for men and women of the same age ranged from 4.6 percent to 5.4 percent. the divorce rate for men in the same age range was 0.6 percent. the study also found that only 7.4 percent of the 45.6 million americans who were in the marriages before 1987 (those with a bachelor's degree) lived with their spouse and were married or living together. the divorce rate for men was 1.9 percent. all about marriage • the john f. kennedy library foundation • national economy • divorce",fair

""if confirmed, this is a very serious situation,"" said dr. margaret chan, who heads the agency. she said that the vaccine must be used only ""for the purposes of preventing the spread of pandemic flu, and for the protection of health-care personnel and care providers."" the vaccine, known as an orphan vaccine, has been developed by glaxosmithkline and sanofi, in cooperation with the harvard school of public health and the national institutes of health. the vaccine is made by merck kgaa. the companies are trying to build the vaccine into a commercially available drug, a process that would require regulatory approval. only four doses of the vaccine have been available, and most of the patients have not responded to treatment. in the united states, the virus has infected at least 215 people, killing 561, according to the centers for disease control and prevention. but some of the recent deaths were related to swine flu, because of complications with the vaccine. dr. diane c. curtis, an infection specialist at the f.d.a., said that the vaccine was still a crucial tool in fighting the outbreak. she said that the vaccine could be given to ""some very sick people"" and that it should not be taken as a substitute for other vaccines. earlier this month she said that she expected to approve orphan vaccine after testing it on more than a million people. the vaccine works by preventing the virus from multiplying in the body, and it does not affect the immune system. until recently, the virus had been considered ""almost nonexistent"" in the united states, dr. curtis said. but in the last week, many of the deaths related to the swine flu virus have been linked to other diseases. dr. curtis said the vaccine would help protect the public from those diseases.",fair

926,"opinion | a story from inside the coronavirusâ early whirlwinds of the global warming pathogenicâ this year, the world has witnessed the world's warmest ever summer on record and the summer is expected to be even hotter. the weather pattern is changing, but the severity of it is still unknown. so what are the lessons we can learn? do people need to take precautions? here are some answers. first, we can take a position on the global warming scare, not just because we hear it every day, but because the truth is that it is happening every part of the world. we call it the climate impact scare. this is a term that is used by climate scientists, often referred to as ""global warming syndrome."" many scientists and policymakers will admit that the global warming scare has been overstated. but the warnings are being given every day and they are just the first of many. climate change scare is real. but the more scientists think about it, the less likely they are to make a change. our best approach is to take steps to reduce our emissions and to make our houses more energy-efficient. we can also take steps to reduce our dependence on oil, to curtail greenhouse gas emissions, to make the world safer using less fossil fuels and to make our planet more resilient to future climate change. to improve our own physical and mental health, we will need to be more aware of our climate. research shows that we have a lot to learn about what creates a longer-lived climate. as a simple question, don't worry about it. when you're facing these kinds of uncertainty, the best way to deal with it is to take action. we want to make sure you are aware of it and that you are prepared to take action. first, we have to figure out where we are going to get our energy from. we need to create new generation sources of energy, like wind power. we have to find ways to use renewables in our homes, and we have to use the sun's power in our homes. if we have to use solar power, we have to start using solar energy. we do need to work out how to use energy more efficiently, and we have to develop more renewables. we have to come up with more efficient models of energy use, and we have to put more people on the grid.",fair

943,"technology may have helped solve the uk's internet problem in april, david cameron warned that the internet was about to take the ""ultimate"" step back, with a new generation of internet-connected machines expected to drive a huge rejuvenation of britain. the prime minister said the internet was a ""brilliant thing."" but concerns have grown over the quality of the internet speeds available in a country where the uk has one of the lowest internet speeds in the world. in june, a damning ofcom assessment of broadband speeds in the country by the regulator found that only 32 per cent of homes, between 0.9 and 5.4 megabits per second, were able to access the internet on their desktops. the government announced a £50 million investment in broadband between 2010 and 2017. while many providers are keen to add fibre networks to improve their networks, mr cameron has been fighting for the roll-out to reach everyone. last month, two of britain's leading broadband providers, talktalk and bt, announced that they were launching an initiative to boost download speeds. mr cameron said that the government had made tough decisions to deliver superfast broadband, including the introduction of 4g broadband and the creation of a ""competitive edge,"" a new industry-based broadband infrastructure plan. but he added that there was still a ""long way to go"" and it was important to give consumers a better deal. he is also leading calls for the uk to remain part of the common fibre project agreed by the european commission, the national audit office and the cbi. but mr cameron said that british consumers were ""absolutely"" behind the internet-connected houses in the land today. competition between the uk and france, germany and austria has been fierce, with nearly two-thirds of all homes in the country able to access the internet at less than two megabits per second. but mr cameron has hit back at allegations that britain's broadband is lagging behind the rest of the world. in a speech last week, he said that broadband was ""not fixed"" and called for a national roll-out of super-fast broadband to combat rising bills. but the prime minister also said that the government was working with ofcom, the telecoms regulator, to bring broadband into the country. while the government admits to ""profound"" problems with the internet, mr cameron said bt was now working on ""fibre-optic broadband opportunities in the uk.""",fair
944,"science & environment - the new york times q. i have a new rodent recently. a. is there a problem? a. rodents are carriers, not creatures. they move around by themselves because they are startled by their surroundings - they are unable to find them in a wide open space and their droppings are not as sharp as they once were. because of the new adaptive evolution, the rodent's behaviour is affected by external objects. rodents are also dependent on the environment in which they live. usually, the animals will feed on plants, insects, fungi and insects and live in a particular social group. but when a rodent tries to scale a building, it will jump down and run into the ground. if it is not able to find a new rodent, it will start to run away. if it is hungry, it will climb up its gracefully-built tunnel. if it is not hungry they will attempt to climb on to the roof of the building. they will attempt to scale it, but it will fall. eventually the rodent will run away. is there a safety net? a. rodents can live in densely populated areas with few resources if they are not willing to flee and can eat anything, including fruit or vegetables. the environmental protection agency estimates that there are between 400 and 1,000 rodents in each city in the united states. more than half of them are rodents. the rodents that live in densely populated areas have evolved to tolerate a wide range of environments, including the most visible ones, like the new york city subway system, the subway system and the ports of los angeles and long beach. in cities like los angeles, the rodents have moved into more suburban areas, and most of these places have become more densely populated since humans arrived. the rodents, in fact, are adaptive to conditions in which they live. they have been known to hunt in packs and attack people, and they are more likely to hunt for people. rodents, while not a common sight in urban areas, can catch people unawares by acting as a deterrent to them. they can also move through the open spaces of buildings, and can jump over fences and trees to gain access to people. the rodent is known as a ""rodent soldier"" because of its ability to jump high.",fair

955,"bbc - how one british man is setting up a digital bank 24 january 2014 last updated at 00: 08 help when paul wilson, 30, started giving online banking a go back in 2008, he was so fascinated by the technology that he decided to set up a digital bank. in 2010 his bank, which is based in london, was taken over by barclays, and he and his friends became the first in the uk to launch their business banking app. ""i wanted to create an app that would be easy to use,"" he explains. after the failure of an earlier attempt, mr wilson started the idea of creating a global bank that would be cheaper and easier to manage. he and his friends have now brought in more than $2m (£1.3m) in venture funding and have launched a new company called pure digital global, which uses text to pay for and process transactions. this was a way of creating a bank that would allow customers to pay for items they want, and then borrow from the bank's website to buy and sell them. mr wilson was inspired by a story in the daily telegraph last week on how a small bank in switzerland got into difficulties last year after a man raised money for it. ""the thing that struck me when i was first asked to start the project was the way that the banking system worked,"" he says. i would walk into a branch and i would see a cheque for a customer who had run up a loan that had gone wrong and hadn't paid its balance to the bank. but it became clear that the majority of banks in the uk were not suitable for that kind of thing. so mr wilson decided that his app, which uses the latest technology, would be very useful as well as a way to pay for items that might be more convenient for customers of the banks they do business with. he says the app is aimed at people who are also banking on the internet, and who might not otherwise have been able to access banking services online. the app is available free by downloading from apple app store, android market and google play. pure digital global is based in london. you can follow the company's progress on twitter at @ pure _ digital _ uk. find out more about the technology at bbc world service. you can also follow us on twitter at @ bbcworld _ . the bbc world service is available on fm on tuesday from 10: 30 gmt on bbc world service. you can also follow us on facebook.",fair

""although we are not advocating a reduction in alcohol consumption, we have concerns about the impact of alcohol on women and family life,"" she said. in addition, for many women, the economic impact of alcohol consumption has been well documented. for example, the rate of alcohol-related deaths in the uk is higher than in most of the european countries in terms of life expectancy. for example, the number of pre-term births in the uk is lower than in all other european countries compared to european countries. but she added: ""in the uk, over half of all early-life pregnancies are unplanned."" the chief medical officer for england, sally davies, said: ""the public wants to know what's happening. however, there are still areas which currently have no alcohol limits for women, and they need to accept a change in the law. dr altmann added that"" the public's trust in government is at an all-time low, and the public also expects more and more alcohol to be consumed.

960,"middle east conflict puts the world in a hurry middle east peace talks in saudi arabia last month produced no breakthrough, with just over two-year tenure at stake. but tensions are expected to rise. it would be a disaster if it had been any different. middle east peace talks in saudi arabia produced no breakthrough yesterday, as the latest round ended deadlock. saudi arabia is also locked in an escalating war in yemen. saudi arabia, the united arab emirates, bahrain, egypt and the united arab emirates intervened militarily in yemen's civil war in 2015 to help the government push back houthi rebels. as part of the agreement, saudi arabia and the uae provided $150million in aid and personnel to the yemeni government. but the conflict has escalated in recent weeks. saudi arabia is leading the war against the houthi rebels and has begun bombing the rebels' positions in yemen. the uae continues to support the rebels in yemen, but saudi arabia's king salman has played a key role in the conflict too. the uae's role has become significant in the region following the killing of journalist jamal khashoggi. last week, it was revealed that the saudi crown prince had ordered the killing of khashoggi by a saudi hit squad, in a diplomatic blow to the saudis. meanwhile, yemen's houthi insurgents have been advancing towards the capital sanaa in recent weeks. a war monitor claimed on tuesday that coalition air strikes had killed dozens of civilians, including women and children, in the city of saada province in south-east yemen. the monitor, known as the britain-based syrian observatory for human rights, said coalition warplanes had dropped barrel bombs - small weapons that are often dropped over a wide area - into the area. the city lies near the border with saudi arabia and is home to a major oil refinery. it is already a stronghold of the houthis who seized sanaa in september, forcing president hadi to flee the country and forcing most of the country's military to withdraw. a saudi-led coalition has been bombing the houthis militarily in the last two years, but some of the strikes have been targeting different groups within yemen - meaning the conflict is likely to be exacerbated by the presence of saudi arabia in the country. while the rebels have a prominent position in yemen, saudi arabia is known to have supported the houthis on numerous occasions.",fair
961,"bbc - rising global sea levels could raise sea levels by 3.6m by 2050 - report a rising sea level of up to 3.6 metres (10.6ft) could raise sea levels by as much as 12m by 2050, according to a new study by a group of scientists. a report by the bbc's environment correspondent jonathan amos and a team from the university of exeter has been commissioned to look at the threat of rising seas caused by climate change. they conclude that increased warmth could add up to 10 billion tonnes of co2 to the atmosphere every year, which will lead to a sharp rise in global sea levels by the century's end. but the report also says that rising seas could have a serious and lasting effect on marine life. the report describes the most likely scenario as rising seas will cause more rapid melting of the atmosphere, releasing more carbon into the atmosphere and higher sea levels. the authors of the new report say that, while the impact of rising seas is ""relatively small,"" they believe the effects are far more widespread. ""the risk is not as great as we thought,"" said professor ian gill of the university of exeter. but they added that rising seas could add up to more than 2bn tonnes of carbon to the atmosphere every year and cause a ""real and substantial increase in sea levels."" the report, published in the journal science, also suggests that if sea levels rise by up to 1.4m (3.6ft) by 2050, there will be an additional 8bn tonnes of carbon release into the atmosphere. the report recommends that countries take urgent action to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit. but the authors say that action must be taken urgently, as a lack of new technologies could delay the process and make the problem worse. what happens to our oceans? how will it change? bbc environment correspondent richard taylor said: ""the report is the latest sign that climate change will probably have an impact on the cost of living and the economy of the world's largest country. if the same trends continue and the world's economy is slowed by the potential extinction of the giant pandas at the end of the century, the cost of living per person will rise by 9% for the next 30 years - and as many as half of the world's population will become unemployed. follow jonathan on twitter: @ bbcgreatthisweeklive",fair

""this is the biggest cocaine seizure in the country's history,"" mr dos santos said. there will be lots more drug runners coming to guinea-bissau. the people of guinea-bissau are used to these kinds of criminal activity. guinea-bissau is well known for the trafficking of cocaine, with almost all traffic from africa crossing the border. president bissau is facing a crucial july 30 general election in which his socialist party is expected to come second. the un estimates that the cocaine trade has been worth $18bn globally since 2005, with many of the illegal drugs transported by sea. the government has been cracking down on human traffickers, who use the country's coastline as a base for their operations. last week the european union approved a new trade embargo against guinea-bissau. it is hoped that the new measures will be enough to clamp down on the traffickers. the economic crisis - blamed on the collapse in commodity prices - has triggered a drop in world commodity prices. the un estimates that the country is still to recover from a devastating 2009 earthquake. according to the president, a government of national unity has been in place since 2003, but the current political turmoil has led to a decline in trade. this has led to a decline in the level of economic activity. in 2009 we were the world's biggest exporter of cocaine, but the last five years we've been one of the world leaders in the export of cocaine. this is going to be a very difficult situation for the country, ""mr dos santos said. guinea-bissau was a portuguese colony until 1882, and it has been the largest cocaine exporter in the world. it is one of the least developed countries in the world, with many of its citizens still living in poverty and deprivation. the country's banks are closed and people are unable to send money to relatives abroad.",fair

""we need to get more information about sex and gender, not just about it at secondary school,"" said ms thomas. she said that sex-selective education should be covered by a law ""to help teachers teach students the facts."" a department for education spokesman said gender and sexuality were ""complex issues"" and that the government had a ""clear and transparent position"" on gender selective education. ""sex and gender selective education is about creating a positive environment which stimulates learning,"" he said. schools and colleges should teach children how to adapt to their gender identity and be aware of their gender. we know that gender selection has a wide impact on children's lives, and that both boys and girls experience higher levels of gender identity and the prospect of having to be gender-specific. the government is absolutely committed to supporting gender diverse colleges and universities and ensuring that they continue to give high quality education to all students. there are currently more than 3,600 sex and gender inclusive colleges in the uk. a recent yougov poll found that 62% of respondents would like to see a gender-specific range of gender-neutral colleges open. the nss, the uk's only membership organisation for sex-selective education, also wants to see gender-neutral colleges offered in state schools. sex selective education is on the government's radar in schools and college partnerships have been set up to provide more gender-specific education. a department for education spokesperson said: ""sexual and gender-diverse colleges have been a particular focus of our strategy for sex education. we will look to see where this development can take us and work to help young people and parents to make informed choices and become more involved in the education of their children.",fair
1047,"how europe deals with terror offenders when they are freed from jail and given a licence. the parole board is responsible for setting parole rules, but it does not grant licences for those convicted of terrorist offences, or those who have already served their sentence. if you had been convicted of a terrorist offence, your sentence would have been shortened, but you would still have been considered for parole. this is because the parole board relies on a number of factors to decide whether someone should be released, including the risk that they will commit another crime or be re-released again. the board's decision is final, but it is inconsistent with the human rights act, which allows judges to overturn decisions made by the parole board. this was the case when adel abdel aziz was sentenced to life for his part in the 1998 bombings of us embassies in tanzania and kenya. following his trial, the attorney general (lord goldsmith) found that the police had acted lawfully by shooting the accused, when the shooting was believed to be an act of self-defence. he added that the shooting ""may have gone entirely unjustified,"" but had fallen ""well short of his personal view."" this led to the most revulsion in the west, and led to many politicians and human rights lawyers to demand that the decision be overturned. the legal advice of the government is that if the parole board were to reject a prisoner's application for release, it would be in breach of the european convention on human rights, which protects freedom of expression, and would, in effect, constitute a breach of article 3 of the privacy and civil liberties (cantor) convention, and constitute a breach of the european convention on human rights. a further complication arose when the european court of human rights found that the european arrest warrant (eaw) was unlawful. the eaw was introduced in december 1999 and was intended to protect uk citizens' freedom of expression, but it has been criticised for being outdated. it was widely assumed that the home secretary, theresa may, intended to introduce a new version of the eaw in the wake of the 9 / 11 attacks. any attempt to change it has been strongly opposed by senior politicians. we are not surprised by the decision to change the law in this case. more than 130 men were convicted of terrorism",fair

1060,"the plot against americaâ s vision feels eerily familiar right now, from the ""90s to the current political climate. this is a time when the media, which had a long track record of covering the political and economic debates of the day, is the best-funded source to report, and is the most effective source for the president's words and deeds. and yet, this is not a time when america's political system is in crisis. we've gotten so used to the idea that anything can happen in the name of the presidency, that it's hard to see why things are going to keep getting worse. the media, over and over again, has become the place when the president and his team are attempting to justify their actions in the context of the political system and the country. the media has, in the way of the public, become the place where even the best-informed leaders are supposed to hide behind a wall of silence. we have seen this for a while, and it's hard to tell what the consequences will be if the president departs behind a wall. but what's striking about this is that, with the president's re-election campaign under way, it's possible to still see the possibility of something worse, and that it's possible to imagine what it could be. the media, as the public is to foster the president's brand of politics, has become the place where only the best-informed leaders can hide behind a wall. the media, on the other hand, has expanded beyond its core role as the public's bulwark against the politics of the political systems. it's a place where the media has expanded beyond its core role as the public's bulwark against the politics of the political system. it's a place where the media has expanded beyond its core role as the public's guide to the political system. it's a place where an unelected president can actually be elected, and thus claim the mandate to change the political system, while also making it more difficult for the media to do its job. even the most qualified newspaper editors in the country could be left exposed if the president remains unelected. but it's also been a place where the press has been able to consistently report on the power of the media, and we've seen this for a while now, and it's hard to tell what the consequences will be if the president departs behind a wall of silence. the media has become the place where the president and his team are",fair

1062,"how do you keep a space station clean? the astronauts aboard the international space station (iss) were able to have their space suits clean with a couple of simple simple moves - they placed a sheet over the surface of the water to protect the clothing. when the suit was cooled by the iss's module, astronauts had to wear it for five days straight. the crew's helmet is made of synthetic fibres, and the space suit has three carbon composite panels on display. a video of the astronauts' laundry was released by the iss this week, and it shows them cleaning the module and the cooling system before the suit is placed inside the protective suit. the iss provides a great deal of moisture for astronauts to use in space. however, nasa explains that the crew may opt to wash their suits with a shower once the suits are released into the atmosphere. the astronauts are forced to wear gloves or wash their hands before they shower. this is because if the gloves are wet, the water is not enough to cover the fabric. however, the astronauts have their masks drawn and their clothes washed regularly. when they get wet the suits are very dirty, but the astronauts have their hands washed. they are also able to cool their suits by spritzing them with cold water. this solution is one of the most common household gadgets aboard the iss. a shower can be used to warm up a space suit before being put into space. the shower can be used to wash a suit before being put into space. the shower can be used to cool a space suit before being put into space. ""all of this is done from the comfort of orbit,"" nasa explains. it is not just about being able to use a shower. a shower can be used to cool a space suit before being put into space. this is the only way to remove oil. it is also effective when the suit is in use. not only do the astronauts know how to use the shower, but they also know how to use it. the crew is also able to use the shower to clean the suits before it is placed in the protective suit. ""it's kind of like a glove,"" astronaut sunita williams said when nasa released this video. it doesn't have to be in a tight spot to be effective. it's sort of like a big bag of rubbish.",fair
